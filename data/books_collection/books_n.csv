Nadaar Log / نادار لوگ,,[],"Published first in 1996 this novel by Abdullah Hussain is considered as a sequel to his famous Udaas Naslain. The story of this novel takes place during 1897 to 1974. This is the story of a generation that has no urge to protect and fight for its rights, people who have accepted everything as fate and have left themselves to the flow of time. The story really gets a takeoff after 1947 when Pakistan gets independence and the people who fought for certain ideals are pushed to wall by those who happen to be in corridors of power. The novel describes those years of indifference, difficulties and turbulence which first germinate the seeds of undemocratic governments and then it leads to secession of the country in 1971. The novel suggests that this was the period where if truth was upheld the history and the geography of Pakistan would have been different but since people kept silence which tantamount to a sin, so they have to reap the wages of this in shape of disintegrating the federation and losing their brothers.

Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I've Learned,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Comedy', 'Adult', 'Tv']","He's one of America's most recognizable and acclaimed actors-a star on Broadway, an Oscar nominee for The Aviator, and the only person to ever win Emmys for acting, writing, and directing, during his eleven years on M*A*S*H. Now Alan Alda has written a memoir as elegant, funny, and affecting as his greatest performances.""My mother didn't try to stab my father until I was six,"" begins Alda's irresistible story. The son of a popular actor and a loving but mentally ill mother, he spent his early childhood backstage in the erotic and comic world of burlesque and went on, after early struggles, to achieve extraordinary success in his profession.Yet Never Have Your Dog Stuffed is not a memoir of show-business ups and downs. It is a moving and funny story of a boy growing into a man who then realizes he has only just begun to grow.It is the story of turning points in Alda's life, events that would make him what he is-if only he could survive them.From the moment as a boy when his dead dog is returned from the taxidermist's shop with a hideous expression on his face, and he learns that death can't be undone, to the decades-long effort to find compassion for the mother he lived with but never knew, to his acceptance of his father, both personally and professionally, Alda learns the hard way that change, uncertainty, and transformation are what life is made of, and true happiness is found in embracing them.Never Have Your Dog Stuffed, filled with curiosity about nature, good humor, and honesty, is the crowning achievement of an actor, author, and director, but surprisingly, it is the story of a life more filled with turbulence and laughter than any Alda has ever played on the stage or screen.

He greatly loved his people and they loved him. In seeking to give his flock the most genuine experience of the early Church prayer and worship services, he carefully read Scripture, the Fathers of the Church and writings of the early saints.

Alex began to share his findings with his parish, and eventually Alex, and most of his parish, joined the Catholic Church. This is his incredible story of a black Penecostal minister's challenging and dramatic spiritual jounrey, and the flock that followed him.

  NARCISSISM
 Are you a narcissist? Do you interact with someone who is? Contrary to popular belief, narcissists do not love themselves or anyone else. They cannot accept their true selves, constructing instead fixed masks that hide emotional numbness. Influenced by forces in culture and predisposed by factors in the human personality, narcissists tend to be  • More concerned with how they appear than what they feel  • Seductive and manipulative, striving for power and control  • Egotists, focused on their own interests but lacking the true values of the self -- self-expression, self-possession, dignity, and integrity  • Without a solid sense of self, which leads them to experience life as empty and meaningless  In this groundbreaking study, Dr. Alexander Lowen uses his extensive clinical experience to demonstrate how narcissists can recover their suppressed feelings and regain their lost humanity. By the use of Bioenergetic Analysis, the psychotherapy created by Dr. Lowen, a new possibility of a fulfilling and authentic life is presented for people with narcissistic characteristics and for those who interact with them.",,,11/06/84,March 1st 2004,[],Paperback,,9780743255431,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348347369l/664920.jpg,3.99,[],91.0,1.0,,,,92.0,687.0,256,Touchstone,"['251', '242', '139', '45', '10']",,[],,['Alexander Lowen']

Nonviolence is considered as the highest virtue because nonviolence has the capacity to transform individual, society and the world. Transformation happens slowly and silently in every single moment, without notice. Nonviolence is only for the brave men and women of the world because it requires courage – courage to love the beauty of life, beauty of humanity and the beauty of the world. It also requires courage to discard the old beliefs and the old ideas of religions and spiritualities in the framework of true humanity and love. In this book Dr.Ray explained the practical ways of practicing nonviolence in daily life. The seeds of violence exist in the daily feelings of suppression, guilt, shame and disappointments. These seeds can be eliminated by practicing simple techniques. The book deals with all the practical issues of practicing nonviolence.",,,,"Nobel Peace Prize

The hallmarks of Shirley Porter's regime at Westminster City Council are as well known as they are farcical.

New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Cults', 'Inspirational']","It is a very responsible thing to translate the Holy Scriptures from their original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek into modern speech. Translating the Holy Scriptures means rendering into another language the thoughts and sayings of Jehovah God, the heavenly Author of this sacred library of sixty-six books that holy men of long ago were inspired to write down for our benefit today.That is a very sobering thought. The translators of this work, who fear and love the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, feel toward Him a special responsibility to transmit his thoughts and declarations as accurately as possible. They also feel a responsibility toward the searching readers who depend upon a translation of the inspired Word of the Most High God for their everlasting salvation.It was with such a sense of solemn responsibility that over the course of many years this committee of dedicated men have produced the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. The entire work was originally released in six volumes, from 1950 to 1960. From the start it was the desire of the translators to have all these volumes brought together into one book, inasmuch as the Holy Scriptures are in actuality one book by the One Author. While the original volumes contained marginal references and footnotes, the revised one-volume edition, released in 1961, contained neither footnotes nor marginal references. A second revision was released in 1970 and a third revision with footnotes followed in 1971. In 1969 the committee released The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, which presented under the Greek text revised by Westcott and Hort (1948 Reprint) a literal word-for-word translation into English. During the past 34 years the New World Translation has been translated in part or in its entirety into ten other languages, with a total printing and distribution surpassing 39 million.This new edition is not just a refinement of the translated text beyond its already previous revisions, but it has been expanded to include a complete updating and revision of the marginal (cross) references that were initially presented in English, from 1950 to 1960.This 1984 revision has been released by us to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for printing, translation into other leading languages and distribution. We thus make it available with a deep sense of gratitude to the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, who has so privileged us and in whose spirit we have trusted in producing this revision. We pray for his blessing upon those who use this translation for spiritual advancement.New World Bible Translation CommitteeJune 1, 1984, New York, N.Y.",,,10/28/61,1984,[],Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337449993l/2381176.jpg,4.61,[],400.0,4.0,,,,92.0,1772.0,1600,"Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc","['1527', '50', '50', '45', '100']",,[],,"['Watch Tower Bible', 'Tract Society']"

"New Worlds, Ancient Texts",The Power of Tradition and the Shock of Discovery,History,"On encountering what he called ""the Indies"", the Jesuit Jose de Acosta wrote, ""Having read what poets and philosophers write of the Torrid Zone, I persuaded myself that when I came to the Equator, I would not be able to endure the violent heat, but it turned out otherwise... What could I do then but laugh at Aristotle's Meteorology and his philosophy?"" Acosta's experience echoes that of his fellow travelers to the New World, and it is this experience, with its profound effect on Western culture, that Anthony Grafton charts. Describing an era of exploration that went far beyond geographic bounds, this book shows how the evidence of the New World shook the foundations of the old, upsetting the authority of the ancient texts that had guided Europeans so far afield. The intellectual shift mapped out here, a movement from book learning to empirical knowledge, did not take place easily or quickly, and Grafton presents it in all its drama and complexity. What he recounts is in effect a war of ideas fought, sometimes unwittingly by mariners, scientists, publishers, scholars, and rulers over one hundred fifty years. He shows us explorers from Cortes and Columbus to Scaliger and Munster, laden with ideas gathered from ancient and medieval texts, in their encounters with the world at large. In colorful vignettes, firsthand accounts, published debates, and copious illustrations, we see these men and their contemporaries trying to make sense of their discoveries as they sometimes confirm, sometimes contest, and finally displace traditional images and notions of the world beyond Europe. The fundamental cultural revolution that Grafton documents still reverberates in our time. By taking us into thisbattle of books versus facts, a conflict that has shaped global views for centuries, Grafton allows us to re-experience and understand the Renaissance as it continues to this day.",,,,1992.0,,,0674618769,9780674618763,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=APVWL5avg7oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.58,,,,,,,,,296.0,,,70.0,,,"['Anthony Grafton', 'Nancy G.

Not Exactly a Love Story,,"['Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Audiobook', 'High School', 'Coming Of Age', 'Humor', 'Teen']","It's 1977. Fifteen-year old Vinnie isn't having a good year. He's recovering from the worst case of galloping acne his dermatologist's ever seen. His girl moved to California without even saying good-bye. And the ink on his parents divorce papers is barely dry, when his mom announces that they're moving from Queens to Long Island.The silver lining in all this is that they move next door to Patsy—everyone's dream girl. Not that she'd ever notice him. But when Vinnie calls Patsy one night, it leads to a chain of anonymous midnight conversations. Under the cover of darkness, Vinnie becomes Vincenzo, Patsy's mystery caller, and the two share a side of themselves they would never reveal in daylight and develop a surprisingly real connection (despite the lies it's built on). As Vinnie gets to know Patsy in real life though, it becomes clear both identities can't survive and he'll have to find a way to hangup the phone and step into the daylight. Fraught with complications and crackling with witty dialogue, and all the angst and electricity that comes with always being just a phone wire away from the one you want, acclaimed author Audrey Couloumbis's YA debut is a smooth-talking Cyrano meets Saturday Night Fever and tells a quirky, flirty, and smart story that will appeal to fans of Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Frank Portman's King Dork, Natalie Standiford's How to Say Goodbye in Robot, and John Green's An Abundance of Katherines. It's not exactly a love story . . . but it's pretty close.  ",,,12/01/11,December 11th 2012,[],Hardcover,,9780375867835,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344369725l/13573412.jpg,3.37,[],100.0,1.0,,,,86.0,829.0,276,Random House Books for Young Readers,"['103', '250', '357', '91', '28']",,[],,['Audrey Couloumbis']

Nomad: From Islam to America: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Islam', 'Autobiography', 'Africa', 'Feminism', 'Biography Memoir']","""This woman is a major hero of our time."" —Richard Dawkins Ayaan Hirsi Ali captured the world’s attention with Infidel, her compelling coming-of-age memoir, which spent thirty-one weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Now, in Nomad, Hirsi Ali tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made to her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed, and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical journey to freedom and, more crucially, her emotional journey to freedom—her transition from a tribal mind-set that restricts women’s every thought and action to a life as a free and equal citizen in an open society. Through stories of the challenges she has faced, she shows the difficulty of reconciling the contradictions of Islam with Western values. In these pages Hirsi Ali recounts the many turns her life took after she broke with her family, and how she struggled to throw off restrictive superstitions and misconceptions that initially hobbled her ability to assimilate into Western society. She writes movingly of her reconciliation, on his deathbed, with her devout father, who had disowned her when she renounced Islam after 9/11, as well as with her mother and cousins in Somalia and in Europe. Nomad is a portrait of a family torn apart by the clash of civilizations. But it is also a touching, uplifting, and often funny account of one woman’s discovery of today’s America. While Hirsi Ali loves much of what she encounters, she fears we are repeating the European mistake of underestimating radical Islam. She calls on key institutions of the West—including universities, the feminist movement, and the Christian churches—to enact specific, innovative remedies that would help other Muslim immigrants to overcome the challenges she has experienced and to resist the fatal allure of fundamentalism and terrorism. This is Hirsi Ali’s intellectual coming-of-age, a memoir that conveys her philosophy as well as her experiences, and that also conveys an urgent message and mission—to inform the West of the extent of the threat from Islam, both from outside and from within our open societies. A celebration of free speech and democracy, Nomad is an important contribution to the history of ideas, but above all a rousing call to action.",,,04/01/10,May 18th 2010,"['George W.

Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Historical', 'Journalism', 'Memoir']","Nothing to Envy follows the lives of six North Koreans over fifteen years—a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the unchallenged rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il, and the devastation of a far-ranging famine that killed one-fifth of the population. Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen, award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station, and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. Demick takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting, we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.  Nothing to Envy is a groundbreaking addition to the literature of totalitarianism and an eye-opening look at a closed world that is of increasing global importance.",,,,December 29th 2009,[],Kindle Edition,,B002ZB26AO,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529606621l/40604846._SY475_.jpg,4.42,"['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2010)', 'Ryszard Kapuściński Prize Nominee (2011)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2010)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2010)']",882.0,10.0,,,,98.0,65996.0,338,Spiegel & Grau,"['36168', '23531', '4920', '852', '525']",,"[""Korea, Democratic People's Republic of"", ""North Korea (Korea, Democratic People's Republic of)""]",,['Barbara Demick']

After writing The Fire Eternal Chris d'Lacey is now working on his new story, Dark Fire. Five years have passed since David Rain disappeared mysteriously in the Arctic.

New Encyclopedia Of The Dog,,"['Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Dogs', 'Animals', 'Science', 'Education']","It's important to choose our friends wisely, and relationships with man's best friend require a special kind of wisdom. Renowned veterinarian Bruce Fogle (Natural Dog Care) has compiled over 400 pages of helpful advice concerning canine companions, and those looking to learn more about their favorite breeds need look no further. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog's six chapters are filled with gorgeous photos illustrating dogs of all ages from every breed imaginable. While the majority of the book is devoted to explanations of specific breeds, five short chapters provide information on evolution, domestication, health and anatomy, communication, and the roles dogs have played in recent human history. With historical photographs of tapestries, ceramics, and movie posters, as well as intricate diagrams of canine anatomy and charts outlining proper health care, these chapters provide great material for middle-school research papers or science-fair projects. The 310 pages that fall within the ""Domestic Dog Breed"" chapter are further divided into nine categories of dogs that range from fascinating primitives to hard-working livestock and guarding dogs. Each breed has multiple photos, both as an adult and a puppy, and a standard set of information that includes size, weight, life expectancy, date and country of origin, and AKC registration. A few simple icons, explained in this chapter's introduction, provide you with information at a glance--when learning about new breeds, you'll know right away if the dog requires extensive grooming and plenty of exercise, or is suitable for small children and city dwelling. From the popular golden retriever to the exotic xoloitzcuintli, the perfect pooches in these photos would melt even the heart of Cruella DeVille. --Jill Lightner",,,09/14/95,October 5th 2000,[],Hardcover,,9780751304718,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394421777l/2804962.jpg,4.38,[],93.0,1.0,,,,98.0,280.0,416,Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd,"['157', '80', '36', '6', '1']",,[],,['Bruce Fogle']

Loosely based on the author’s own life, it is the story of an orphaned young woman who leaves her small town to attend university in war-ravaged Barcelona.Residing amid genteel poverty in a mysterious house on Calle de Aribau, young Andrea falls in with a wealthy band of schoolmates who provide a rich counterpoint to the squalor of her home life. As experience overtakes innocence, Andrea gradually learns the disquieting truth about the people she shares her life with: her overbearing and superstitious aunt Angustias; her nihilistic yet artistically gifted uncle Román and his violent brother Juan; and Juan’s disturbingly beautiful wife, Gloria, who secretly supports the clan with her gambling. From existential crisis to a growing maturity and resolve, Andrea’s passionate inner journey leaves her wiser, stronger, and filled with hope for the future.The incomparable Edith Grossman’s vital new translation captures the feverish energy of Laforet’s magnificent story, showcasing its dark, powerful imagery, and its subtle humor.

When Nicholas Nickleby is left penniless after his father's death, he appeals to his wealthy uncle to help him find work and to protect his mother and sister. But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous, and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world. His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers, the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys; the slow-witted orphan Smike, rescued by Nicholas; and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummles and their daughter, the 'infant phenonenon'.

Nesohc: A new version of Jesus,,[],"This book is a marvelous novel with a new twist on the origin, birth, life, miracles, teachings, death and resurrection of Jesus. The author attributes the of origin of Jesus to an extraterrestrial civilization who also seeded earth with the elements which made possible the development of life. He explains that Jesus came to complement the 12 commandments, as purposefully prearranged and directed by an unusual superpower. The novel is very well researched and the plot unfolds in an enjoyable and easy to follow manner which glues you to the book from beginning to end. The protagonists, (Jesus and the disciples), are depicted in a fresh, realistic, humorous and earthly manner befitting of their true nature. The plot, although a fictional interpretation of the life of Jesus, is so plausible that it is difficult to discard, and throw it in the “science fiction” bag. The author presents reasonable alternatives as to the origin of life on earth; the development, nature, and ultimate destination of the human soul; a sensible method of space travel infinitely faster than the speed of light; and many other wonderfully creative insights which provide much fuel for thought. Although the primary purpose of the book is that of entertainment, the very nature of its content is bound to produce a great deal of introspection in those with an open mind. On the other hand, it may seem a bit threatening and controversial to rigid individuals who may be unwilling to consider and analyze accounts which differ from their own views. The author advocates no theories, but merely presents a script which differs from the traditional orthodox view. He makes no allegations as to the validity of the script argument, but merely spills a glass which is soaked by the creative and imaginative minds of the readers I highly recommend this book to all audiences. Its fast an easy to follow style will provide many hours of enjoyable thoughtful reading just as much for adolescents as for elderly adults. Its deep philosophical implications make it a worthy mental exercise for analytical individuals interested in philosophy, metaphysics, religion, psychology, and ethics.

That is what Alexandria Ramsey’s crazy grandmother believes. Grandma Claudia claims Alex descends from a long line of New England witches. Modern day witches in Hazel Cove, Massachusetts? Unlikely, but strange things are occurring in the weeks preceding Alex’s seventeenth birthday, which also coincides with her family’s annual Halloween party. Alex is haunted by bizarre reoccurring nightmares of a man chasing her through the Hazel Cove Cemetery. On a few occasions, when her emotions have spiraled out of control, inanimate objects have shattered around her. But that’s just a coincidence, right? Alex isn’t so sure, especially after a local girl, who supposedly dabbled in witchcraft, was killed in the nearby forest. Alex knows something strange is happening to her. With the arrival of a new boy in town, the mischievous James Van Curen, who is making her life difficult and causing problems between Alex and her best friend, Peter, Alex feels like her entire world is on the verge of chaos. Could Alex really be a witch? Is it possible Hazel Cove will become a battleground for modern day witches and witch hunters? CONJURED – BOOK 2 After the disastrous fallout on Halloween and the tragic events that followed in the Hazel Cove Cemetery, Alexandria is left picking up the pieces of her broken life. Peter is adjusting. James hates her. Grandma Claudia is gone. Emma is incoherent. Victor went rogue. And Gamma still wants her dead. If that wasn’t enough to deal with, two burning questions are driving Alex insane. Who committed that horrible murder in Salem? And what really happened to Ethan? Alex has come to terms with her new life, but she’s yet to truly understand the ramifications of being a pureblooded witch in the supernatural world. And now there is a new danger on the horizon. Alex must find a way to fight. To survive. To protect her remaining family members and her closest friends from an unthinkable new enemy. One much more powerful and much more horrifying than the Gamma witch hunting fraternity. WICKED BETRAYAL – BOOK 3 The clock is ticking. Alex’s time is running out. Spring has hit Hazel Cove and with it, the pressure of Alex’s impending fate as Liam’s sacrifice is weighing upon her every thought. There’s so much to do and so little time. How do you stop an ancient pure blooded witch? But Liam isn’t Alex’s only problem. She must focus on what she can fix in the little time she has left. She must confront the past and the horrible betrayal Ethan suffered at the hands of a once trusted ally. Alex will do anything necessary to save Ethan. Even brave a trip to the supernatural capital of the world - New Orleans. Voodoo, Hoodoo, witches and spirits are nothing compared to the evil Alex will face in the backwoods of the Louisiana bayou. Will Alex’s desperation to save her family and friends pull her closer to the darkness? Who can Alex trust? Will James’ connections as a witch hunter help or hurt her? Can she fix her relationship with Peter? Or will the deep seeds of betrayal shatter Alex’s life? ALL HALLOWS EVE – BOOK 4 All Hallows Eve is the gripping conclusion to the New England Witch Chronicles Series. Halloween is fast approaching and, with it, Alexandria’s eighteenth birthday.

Notes on the Synthesis of Form,,"['Design', 'Architecture', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Business', 'Programming', 'Urban Planning', 'Science', 'Computers']","""These notes are about the process of design: the process of inventing things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to function."" This book, opening with these words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of design.In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities.In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct.The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village.",,,,January 1st 1964,[],Paperback,,9780674627512,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348697342l/320553.jpg,3.99,[],95.0,1.0,,,,93.0,578.0,224,Harvard University Press,"['197', '227', '111', '38', '5']",,[],,['Christopher W.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of our time, Milosz is a master of probing inquiry and graceful expression. His poetry is infused with a tireless spirit and penetrating insight into fundamental human dilemmas and the staggering yet simple truth that “to exist on the earth is beyond any power to name.”Czeslaw Milosz worked with the Polish Resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and defected to France in 1951. His work brings to bear the political awareness of an exile—most notably in A Treatise on Poetry, a forty-page exploration of the world wars that rocked the first half of the twentieth century. His later poems also reflect the sharp political focus through which this Nobel Laureate never fails to bear witness to the events that stir the world.Digging among the rubble of the past, Milosz forges a vision that encompasses pain as well as joy.

Nailed: Ten Christian Myths That Show Jesus Never Existed at All,,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Atheism', 'Christianity', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Mythology', 'Historical', 'Theology']","Why would anyone think Jesus never existed? Isn’t it perfectly reasonable to accept that he was a real first century figure? As it turns out, no. NAILED sheds light on ten beloved Christian myths, and with evidence gathered from historians all across the theological spectrum, shows how they point to a Jesus Christ created solely through allegorical alchemy of hope and imagination; a messiah transformed from a purely literary, theological construct into the familiar figure of Jesus – in short, a purely mythic Christ.Praise for David Fitzgerald’sNailed: Ten Christian Myths That Show Jesus Never Existed At All“Fitzgerald’s is possibly the best ‘capsule summary’ of the mythicist case I’ve ever encountered …with an interesting and accessible approach.”—Earl Doherty, author of The Jesus Puzzle“Fitzgerald summarizes a great number of key arguments concisely and with new power and original spin. I really learned something from him. Recalls classical skeptics and biblical critics. A surprising amount of new material.”—Robert M. Price, author of Deconstructing Jesus and The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man“David Fitzgerald reveals himself to be the brightest new star in the firmament of scholars who deny historical reality to “Jesus of Nazareth.” His brilliance would have been sufficiently established had he done nothing more than illustrate and explain traditional arguments with a clarity and transparency never achieved…But he has done more. He has developed new arguments and insights as well...”—Frank R. Zindler, editor of American Atheist Press and author of The Jesus the Jews Never Knew“Fitzgerald has hit the nail on the head…A nice, readable introduction to the top ten problems typically swept under the rug by anyone insisting it's crazy even to suspect Jesus might not have existed.”—Richard C.

Stumbling around this strange, awesome city, he trips over and crosses—through a hidden destiny or just monstrously bad luck—a number of its secret power centers. Suddenly, the riddle of his father’s identity becomes just one of the increasingly urgent questions Eiji must answer. Why is the line between the world of his experiences and the world of his dreams so blurry? Why do so many horrible things keep happening to him? What is it about the number 9? To answer these questions, and ultimately to come to terms with his inheritance, Eiji must somehow acquire an insight into the workings of history and fate that would be rare in anyone, much less in a boy from out of town with a price on his head and less than the cost of a Beatles disc to his name.",,,10/29/01,February 11th 2003,"['Eiji Miyake', 'Ai Imajo', 'Yuzu Daimon', 'Buntaro Ogiso']",Paperback,,9780812966923,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320540682l/6820.jpg,3.91,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2001)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (2001)']",236.0,3.0,,,,93.0,20485.0,401,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['5687', '8911', '4541', '1033', '313']",,['Tokyo (Japan)'],,['David Mitchell']

Nightwood,,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', '20th Century', 'Womens', 'Literary Fiction']","Nightwood, Djuna Barnes' strange and sinuous tour de force, ""belongs to that small class of books that somehow reflect a time or an epoch"" (TLS). That time is the period between the two World Wars, and Barnes' novel unfolds in the decadent shadows of Europe's great cities, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna—a world in which the boundaries of class, religion, and sexuality are bold but surprisingly porous. The outsized characters who inhabit this world are some of the most memorable in all of fiction—there is Guido Volkbein, the Wandering Jew and son of a self-proclaimed baron; Robin Vote, the American expatriate who marries him and then engages in a series of affairs, first with Nora Flood and then with Jenny Petherbridge, driving all of her lovers to distraction with her passion for wandering alone in the night; and there is Dr. Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor, a transvestite and ostensible gynecologist, whose digressive speeches brim with fury, keen insights, and surprising allusions. Barnes' depiction of these characters and their relationships (Nora says, ""A man is another person—a woman is yourself, caught as you turn in panic; on her mouth you kiss your own"") has made the novel a landmark of feminist and lesbian literature. Most striking of all is Barnes' unparalleled stylistic innovation, which led T. S. Eliot to proclaim the book ""so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.""

No Man's Land: What to Do When Your Company Is Too Big to Be Small but TooSmall to Be Big,,['Business'],"“I travel the country speaking about No Man’s Land to entrepreneurs and business leaders. Wherever I go, I get the same response. Listeners approach me with sadness in their eyes and say, ‘Doug, if only I had known about No Man’s Land when I was running my company, we might still be in business.’”—Doug Tatum  If starting a company is difficult, leading a company once the business has caught fire is infinitely more so. Thousands each year approach the dangerous transition that Doug Tatum calls No Man’s Land—when they are too big to be considered small but still too small to be considered big.  Rapid growth is every entrepreneur’s dream, but it never comes easily and is usually rife with dilemmas. During No Man’s Land, as in human adolescence, such growth should spark self- discovery, acquired discipline, and positive but difficult transition. Unfortunately, it often becomes an agonizing battle between the natural tendencies of a lonely entrepreneur and certain immutable laws of growth. The result is confusion, frustration, stagnation, loss of employee morale, and, at worst, financial failure.  Sounds pretty bleak. The good news is that Doug Tatum knows exactly what it takes to get through No Man’s Land: a map, a high place from which to orient yourself, and navigational rules to help you track your progress. And these tools are here in this book.  Through case studies and stories of successes and failures, No Man’s Land will help you learn how to: *	Align your growing company with its market. *	Execute the necessary changes in your management. *	Confirm that your financial model is scalable. *	Attract money and make smart decisions about financing your business.  If you’re an entrepreneur, this book will help you make your company all it can be and all you want it to be. It will prepare you for a ride that just might be wilder than you ever imagined.",,,,September 13th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781591841722,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347605698l/1212934.jpg,3.92,[],77.0,1.0,,,,95.0,38.0,256,Portfolio Hardcover,"['10', '17', '9', '2', '0']",,[],,['Doug Tatum']

No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks,,"['Nonfiction', 'Mountaineering', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Climbing', 'Outdoors', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir']","This gripping and triumphant memoir follows a living legend of extreme mountaineering as he makes his assault on history, one 8,000-meter summit at a time.For eighteen years Ed Viesturs pursued climbing’s holy grail: to stand atop the world’s fourteen 8,000-meter peaks, without the aid of bottled oxygen. But No Shortcuts to the Top is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, “Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.” It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs’s odyssey, No Shortcuts to the Top is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.",,,01/01/06,October 17th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9780767924702,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320414477l/154924.jpg,4.09,[],95.0,1.0,,,,96.0,9055.0,368,Broadway Books,"['3349', '3663', '1678', '273', '92']",,[],,"['Ed Viesturs', 'David Roberts']"

Brunner claims that the task of that generation was to find a way back to a legitimate natural theology. Barth responds strongly, arguing that there is no way to knowledge of God by way of human reason.

News of a Kidnapping,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Spanish Literature', 'Crime', 'Journalism', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'True Crime', 'Politics', 'Nobel Prize']","THIS ASTONISHING BOOK by the Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez chronicles the 1990 kidnappings of ten Colombian man and women--all journalists but one--by the Medellín drug boss Pablo Escobar. The carefully orchestrated abductions were Escobar's attempt to extort from the government its assurance that he, and other narcotics traffickers, would not be extradited to the United States if they were to surrender.From the highest corridors of government to the domain of the ruthless drug cartels, we watch the unfolding of a bizarre drama replete with fascinating characters Cesar Gaviria, the nation's cool and secretive president; Diana Turbay, a famous television journalist and magazine editor; three indomitable women who are imprisoned for miserable months in a small room with a light perpetually on; an eighty-two-year-old priest with a mission to bring the regime and the cartel to the negotiating table; and Escobar himself, the legendary drug baron who changes his bodyguards daily and maintains a private zoo with giraffes and hippos from Africa.All of this takes place in a country where presidential candidates and cabinet officers are routinely assassinated; where police go into the Medellín slums to murder boys they think may be working for Escobar; but where brave and honest citizens are trying desperately to make democracy survive.An international best-seller, News of a Kidnapping combines journalistic tenacity with the breathtaking language and perception that distinguish the writings of Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez. It draws us unto into a world that, like some phantasmagorical setting in a great Garcí­a Márquez novel, we can scarcely believe exists--but that continually shocks us with its cold, hard reality.",,,10/30/96,July 30th 1998,[],Paperback,,9780140267839,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327701753l/16251.jpg,3.86,[],171.0,2.0,,,,93.0,10535.0,291,Penguin,"['2799', '4334', '2665', '591', '146']",,['Colombia'],,"['Gabriel García Márquez', 'Edith Grossman']"

'The standard of truth has been erected, and no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing. It will not stop until the purposes of God are accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say to us, the work is done!'”Now Brigham's voice quivered with excitement; his eyes burned with intensity. “That's what we're offering here, Joshua. Those men with their painted faces stormed Carthage Jail and thought they had stopped the work. Well, what an enormous shock this will be to them! They're driving us from the state, thinking that will end it. But give us ten years. Fifteen years! And then even a blind man will know that no unhallowed hand can stop this work.”Picking up the story shortly after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, No Unhallowed Hand — volume 7 in the series The Work and the Glory — takes the saga of the Restoration the the fictional Steed family from the end of June 1844 to February 1846.As this volume opens, it is a time of great sadness and of uncertainty. Having lost their beloved prophet, the Saints witness a series of power plays by those who would use the opportunity to further their own interests. It is not long, however, before the Lord's purposes are made apparent and the Twelve take their rightful position as leaders of the Church, with Brigham Young at their head. For a time, an uneasy peace seems to prevail in Illinois, but then the Nauvoo Charter is revoked, anti-Mormon hatred is again inflamed by those involved in the Prophet's death, mobs burn homes in small Mormon settlements, and eventually the Saints again find themselves faced with the threat of violent expulsion unless they agree to leave the state. The situation promises to divide the Steeds. Who among them will go west and who will stay? What will Joshua's and Melissa's part-member families do?This installment in the series contains not only its share of fascinating real-life history, but also a number of plot twists involving the Steeds that will keep readers engaged from beginning to end.

The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland, but in return was given another small island, Manhattan. A brilliant adventure story of unthinkable hardship and savagery, the navigation of uncharted waters, and the exploitation of new worlds, Nathaniel's Nutmeg is a remarkable chapter in the history of the colonial powers.",,,03/04/99,2005,"['Nathaniel Courthope, Captain of the Swan']",Paperback,,9780340696767,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1419182520l/29386.jpg,3.83,[],286.0,3.0,,,,91.0,4166.0,388,Sceptre,"['1171', '1559', '1067', '288', '81']",,[],,['Giles Milton']
Nietzsche and Philosophy,,Philosophy,"Praised for its rare combination of scholarly rigor and imaginative interpretation, Nietzsche and Philosophy has long been recognized as one of the most important analyses of Nietzsche. It is also one of the best introductions to Deleuze's thought, establishing many of his central philosophical positions. In Nietzsche and Philosophy, Deleuze identifies and explores three crucial concepts in Nietzschean thought-multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation-and clarifies Nietzsche's views regarding the will to power, eternal return, nihilism, and difference. For Deleuze, Nietzsche challenged conventional philosophical ideas and provided a means of escape from Hegel's dialectical thinking, which had come to dominate French philosophy. He also offered a path toward a politics of difference. In this new edition, Michael Hardt's foreword examines the profound influence of Deleuze's provocative interpretations on the study of Nietzsche, which opened a whole new avenue in postwar thought.",,,,2006.0,,,0231138768,9780231138765,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KGaYQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.16,,,,,,,,,256.0,,,48.0,,,['Gilles Deleuze']

Want to avoid business disasters, whether minor mishaps, such as excessive team conflict, or major calamities like those that threaten bankruptcy or doom a promising career? Fortunately, behavioral economics studies show that such disasters stem from poor decisions due to our faulty mental patterns—what scholars call “cognitive biases”—and are preventable.Unfortunately, the typical advice for business leaders to “go with their guts” plays into these cognitive biases and leads to disastrous decisions that devastate the bottom line. By combining practical case studies with cutting-edge research, Never Go With Your Gut will help you make the best decisions and prevent these business disasters.The leading expert on avoiding business disasters, Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, draws on over 20 years of extensive consulting, coaching, and speaking experience to show how pioneering leaders and organizations—many of them his clients—avoid business disasters.

Soon, Mencken was assigned to the police beat, and then to city hall, where the really big crooks worked.Mencken learned his craft so well that by 1901 he became the Herald 's Sunday editor, and by 1906 was hired as an editor of the Baltimore Sun, where he quickly attracted a national following. Sustained by a steady diet of crabs, cigars, whiskey, and beer, he haunted Baltimore's jails and courtrooms, its churches, theaters, and saloons, and chased fire wagons, interviewed cops and coroners, battled politicians and crusaders, and raced back to the newsroom to beat his deadline by a second or two.",H.

Naturalizing Epistemology,,['Philosophy'],"The second edition of ""Naturalizing Epistemology ""has been updated and expanded to include seven new articles that take up ongoing debates in the field. As with the first edition, it explores the interaction between psychology and epistemology and addresses empirical questions about how we should arrive at our beliefs, and whether the processes by which we arrive at our beliefs are the ones by which we ""ought ""to arrive at our beliefs.The new material includes a critical examination of Quine's views on epistemology by Jaegwon Kim and an interesting psychological approach to our understanding of natural kinds by Ellen Markman. In other new chapters Jerry Fodor places the notion of observation in a naturalistic perspective, Christopher Cherniak shows how work in the theory of computational complexity bears on the form of an epistemological theory, and Alvin Goldman looks at the relationship between our ordinary epistemological concepts and those of a scientific epistemol-ogy.The prospects for improving our inductive inferences are examined by John Holland, Keith Holyoak, Richard Nisbett, and Paul Thagard, and Stephen Stich suggests a way in which normative concepts may be integrated into a naturalistic epistemology. The book retains articles by W. V. 0. Quine, Alvin I. Goldman, Hilary Kornblith, Philip Kircher, Michael Friedman, Fred Dretske, Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross, Gilbert Harman, and Stephen P.

NGLND XPX,,"['Science Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Anthologies', 'Comedy']","NGLND XPX was written to grab you by the ankle and drag you screaming into a world of funny and not so funny scifi-ish fiction, a soupcon of some dashed fine adventure and a spot of Ealing-esque farce.Rub shoulders with robots carrying teddy bears issuing tablets of Commandments to chaps wandering out of the desert. Squirm in a grandstand seat during an Industrial Revolution completely re-written just to see the new-fangled steam trains running over well-intentioned children (no real harm done). Recognise your neighbours - polite English zombies coping with the dystopian hell of a socialist victory in the General Election. Man up, madam, and do your OAP National Service during the pensioner wars with an insect species. Watch in awe and not some little discomfort as Queen Elizabeth does the dishes for Europe and the Ministry of Defence quietly saves the world from a rogue comet.No caricature is left unused. The science in the fiction is quite splendidly silly. This is a book to be read with tongue in cheek, preferably your own tongue and one of your own face cheeks unless you are very limber. The characters are as deep as summer puddles and the plots are as complicated as two planks of wood. Reality leaves the room on page one and farce enters just one chapter later.

Now, in No Time to Wave Goodbye, the unforgettable Cappadoras are in peril once again, forced to confront an unimaginable evil. It has been twenty-two years since Beth Cappadora’s three-year-old son Ben was abducted. By some miracle, he returned nine years later, and the family began to pick up the pieces of their lives.

Though Beth tries to stave off the torrent of buried emotions, she is left wondering if she and her family are fated to relive the past forever.The film earns tremendous acclaim, but just as the Cappadoras are about to celebrate the culmination of Vincent’s artistic success, what Beth fears the most occurs, and the Cappadoras are cast back into the past, revisiting the worst moment of their lives–with only hours to find the truth that can save a life.

Never anger old people. And don’t do what Tiki tells you to do.  After a slow summer of chasing low-level skips for her cousin Vinnie’s bail bonds agency, Stephanie Plum finally lands an assignment that could put her checkbook back in the black. Geoffrey Cubbin, facing trial for embezzling millions from Trenton’s premier assisted-living facility, has mysteriously vanished from the hospital after an emergency appendectomy. Now it’s on Stephanie to track down the con man. Unfortunately, Cubbin has disappeared without a trace, a witness, or his money-hungry wife. Rumors are stirring that he must have had help with the daring escape . . . or that maybe he never made it out of his room alive. Since the hospital staff’s lips seem to be tighter than the security, and it’s hard for Stephanie to blend in to assisted living, Stephanie’s Grandma Mazur goes in undercover. But when a second felon goes missing from the same hospital, Stephanie is forced into working side by side with Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, in order to crack the case. The real problem is, no Cubbin also means no way to pay the rent. Desperate for money—or maybe just desperate—Stephanie accepts a secondary job guarding her secretive and mouthwatering mentor Ranger from a deadly Special Forces adversary. While Stephanie is notorious for finding trouble, she may have found a little more than she bargained for this time around.

Yet shy of fame and never one to steal the spotlight Armstrong was always reluctant to discuss his personal side of events. Here for the first time is the definitive story of Neil's life of flight he shared for five decades with a trusted friend - Jay Barbree.Working from 50 years of conversations he had with Neil, from notes, interviews, NASA spaceflight transcripts, and remembrances of those Armstrong trusted, Barbree writes about Neil's three passions - flight, family, and friends. This is the inside story of Neil Armstrong from the time he flew combat missions in the Korean War and then flew a rocket plane called the X-15 to the edge of space, to when he saved his Gemini 8 by flying the first emergency return from Earth orbit and then flew Apollo-Eleven to the moon's Sea of Tranquility.Together Neil and Jay discussed everything, from his love of flying, to the war years, and of course his time in space. The book is full of never-before-seen photos and personal details written down for the first time, including what Armstrong really felt when he took that first step on the moon, what life in NASA was like, his relationships with the other astronauts, and what he felt the future of space exploration should be.As the only reporter to have covered all 166 American astronaut flights and moon landings Jay knows these events intimately. Neil Armstrong himself said, ""Barbree is history's most experienced space journalist. He is exceptionally well qualified to recall and write the events and emotions of our time."" Through his friendship with Neil and his dedicated research, Barbree brings us the most accurate account of his friend's life of flight, the book he planned for twenty years.",,,07/01/14,July 8th 2014,[],Hardcover,,9781250040718,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407090463l/18404292.jpg,4.2,[],54.0,1.0,,,,97.0,957.0,384,Thomas Dunne Books,"['420', '350', '154', '25', '8']",,[],,"['Jay Barbree', 'John Glenn']"

  No Less Than Victory is the crowning achievement in master storyteller Jeff Shaara’s soaring World War II trilogy, revealing the European war’s unforgettable and harrowing final act.
After the success of the Normandy invasion, the Allied commanders are buoyantly confident that the war in Europe will be over in a matter of weeks, that Hitler and his battered army have no other option than surrender. But despite the advice of his best military minds, Hitler will hear no talk of defeat. In mid-December 1944, the Germans launch a desperate and ruthless counteroffensive in the Ardennes forest, utterly surprising the unprepared Americans who stand in their way. Through the frigid snows of the mountainous terrain, German tanks and infantry struggle to realize Hitler’s goal: divide the Allied armies and capture the vital port at Antwerp. The attack succeeds in opening up a wide gap in the American lines, and for days chaos reigns in the Allied command. Thus begins the Battle of the Bulge, the last gasp by Hitler’s forces that becomes a horrific slugging match, some of the most brutal fighting of the war. As American commanders respond to the stunning challenge, the German spear is finally blunted.Though some in the Nazi inner circle continue the fight to secure Germany’s postwar future, the Führer makes it clear that he is fighting to the end. He will spare nothing–not even German lives–to preserve his twisted vision of a “Thousand Year Reich.” But in May 1945, the German army collapses, and with Russian troops closing in, Hitler commits suicide. As the Americans sweep through the German countryside, they unexpectedly encounter the worst of Hitler’s crimes, the concentration camps, and young GIs find themselves absorbing firsthand the horrors of the Holocaust.Presenting his riveting account through the eyes of Eisenhower and Patton and the young GIs who struggle face-to-face with their enemy, and through the eyes of Germany’s old soldier, Gerd von Rundstedt, and Hitler’s golden boy, Albert Speer, Jeff Shaara carries the reader on a journey that defines the spirit of the soldier and the horror of a madman’s dreams.",World War II: 1939-1945 #3,,,November 3rd 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780345497925,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388205842l/6441706.jpg,4.28,[],90.0,1.0,,,,99.0,4465.0,449,Ballantine Books,"['1938', '1910', '559', '51', '7']",,[],,['Jeff Shaara']

"Not Paul, But Jesus",,['Christianity'],"*In this edition hundreds of problems in punctuation and spelling that frustrated reading have been corrected (British spellings have been left alone).*Contains a new Forward by Tobias Skinner.*In Not Paul, But Jesus Jeremy Bentham offers solid proof that the books of the Bible ascribed to Paul could not have been divinely inspired due to the numerous fallacies and contradictions contained within them. Indeed, argues Bentham, Paul's works even contradict the teachings of Christ. It is likely the books ascribed to Paul, many of which are merely letters to early Christian churches, were added by the church because the doctrine of Paul allows the church to play a far larger role in the life of Christians than would be the case without the books included. Paul wanted the various churches he visited to practice Christianity his way. His letters tell them to do so, and apparently some influential leaders of the early and later church approved. Whatever the case, Bentham offers convincing proof that an infallible God could not have inspired the writings of Paul, which are far from infallible. In Bentham's view, Paul plays the role of an anti-Christ by making Christ subservient to Paul in the doctrine of Christianity.",,,07/29/09,October 15th 2014,[],Paperback,,9781502846679,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416265729l/23575069.jpg,3.5,[],73.0,1.0,,,,71.0,14.0,280,Watersgreen House,"['5', '4', '1', '1', '3']",,[],,"['Jeremy Bentham', 'Tobias Skinneer']"

Nineteen Nineteen,,Fiction,"With 1919, the second volume of his U.S.A. trilogy, John Dos Passos continues his ""vigorous and sweeping panorama of twentieth-century America"" (Forum), lauded on publication of the first volume not only for its scope, but also for its groundbreaking style. Again, employing a host of experimental devices that would inspire a whole new generation of writers to follow, Dos Passos captures the many textures, flavors, and background noises of modern life with a cinematic touch and unparalleled nerve. 1919 opens to find America and the world at war, and Dos Passos's characters, many of whom we met in the first volume, are thrown into the snarl.

Next Man Up: A Year Behind the Lines in Today's NFL,,"['Sports', 'Football', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Journalism']","In the NFL there is only one certainty: that every day, someone will have to be the Next Man Up. Football is an unrelentingly punishing sport, played and practiced at undiminished intensity, and it devours its players. Confronting injuries, trades, and the grim reality of competition, every NFL team prepares constantly for the likelihood -- the certainty -- that even franchise players can go down at any time. And someone new must be ready, trained, and primed to step in at the highest level.  Bestselling sportswriter John Feinstein persuaded one NFL team to lift the extraordinary secrecy that shrouds the sport and let him see how a team operates at the closest level. One team let him join every practice, every coaches' meeting, every players' gathering, every strategy debate. From the give-and-take of draft day, into the grinder of summer training camps, and from 100-degree practice games to the last game in frigid conditions, Feinstein reveals how a football team works -- or fails to work -- as no writer has done before. Next Man Up unveils rituals (what a coach tells a player at the moment he cuts him); rules (the inanities of league-appointed ""uniform Nazis""); conflicts (the scouts vs. the coaches, the general managers vs. the agents, the offense vs. the defense, the special teams coaches vs. everybody); money (how much a journeyman makes, and how his life differs from the multi-million-dollar-a-year star players)-every nuance of a team's life, from the owner's goals to the coach's day-to-day travails to the feeling of the sleet-soaked ball in the hands of a receiver on artificial turf.  The access John Feinstein enjoyed allows him to discuss with equal understanding the owner's management strategy, the coaches' and coordinators' plans for each new game, and how it all affects the players themselves. Anyone who loves football -- any team, in any era -- will savor the thousands of details revealed here for the first time, and the extraordinary drama that goes into following week after week, the most sensational sport in America.",,,2005,October 12th 2006,[],Paperback,,9780316013284,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442629985l/75634._SY475_.jpg,3.95,[],36.0,1.0,,,,92.0,3817.0,544,Back Bay Books,"['1324', '1335', '870', '201', '87']",,[],,['John Feinstein']
Nickel Mountain,,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'American Fiction']","John Gardner's most poignant novel of improbable love.At the heart of John Gardner's Nickel Mountain is an uncommon love story: when at 42, the obese, anxious and gentle Henry Soames marries seventeen-year-old Callie Wells—who is pregnant with the child of a local boy—it is much more than years which define the gulf between them. But the beauty of this novel is the gradual revelation of the bond that develops as this unlikely couple experiences courtship and marriage, the birth of a son, isolation, forgiveness, work, and death in a small Catskill community in the 1950s. The plot turns on tragic events—they might be accidents or they might be acts of will—involving a cast of rural eccentrics that includes a lonely amputee veteran, a religious hysteric (thought by some to be the devil himself) and an itinerant ""Goat Lady."" Questions of guilt, innocence, and even murder are eclipsed by deeds of compassion, humility, and redemption, and ultimately by Henry Soames' quiet discovery of grace.Novelist William H.

Nathan's Run,,"['Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Young Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Audiobook']","When twelve-year-old Nathan Bailey kills a guard at a juvenile detention center and runs away, the evidence is clear: The guard's murder is part of a brutal escape plan. Declared incorrigible by a judge, and sentenced to 18 months in the Juvenile Detention Center for stealing a car, there's simply no other explanation. Bailey's a thief, a jail breaker and a murderer, and he must be brought to justice. Or so it seems. In ""Nathan's Run,"" first time novelist John Gilstrap displays a unique talent for reaching into today's headlines. His compelling story is woven around two timely issues: the ease with which the juvenile justice system warehouses kids and removes them from our collective consciousness, and the ability of the news media to alter the public's view of individual criminal acts.Fueled by the fiery rhetoric of J. Daniel Petrelli, a local prosecutor with Senatorial ambitions, the public is outraged at Nathan's cold-bloodedness. However, Nathan declares that he killed in self-defense. Polite and articulate, he unwittingly moves beyond the labels that have been thrust upon him -- ""incorrigible"" and ""violent criminal"" -- and becomes to the public at-large what he is in real life; a young boy who's alone in the world, pitted against forces too large for him to comprehend.With it's exceptional realism, suspenseful narrative, and an expertly conveyed sense of desperation, ""Nathan's Run"" is destined to capture the attention of readers and provide John Gilstrap with a legion of fans.",,,02/01/96,August 31st 1997,['Nathan'],Paperback,,9780446604680,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387735977l/1168934.jpg,4.15,[],73.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1780.0,384,Grand Central Publishing,"['723', '691', '286', '63', '17']",,[],,['John Gilstrap']

His last book, Mortal Prey, was ""a model of the genre"" (People) and ""the cop novel of the year"" (Kirkus Reviews). In the words of the Washington Post: ""John Sandford does everything right.""Now, in Naked Prey, he puts Lucas Davenport through some changes. His old boss, Rose Marie Roux, has moved up to the state level and taken Lucas with her, creating a special troubleshooter job for him for the cases that are too complicated or politically touchy for others to handle. In addition, Lucas is married now, and a new father, all of which is fine with him: he doesn't mind being a family man. But he is a little worried. For every bit of peace you get, you have to pay — and he's waiting for the bill.It comes in the form of two people found hanging from a tree in the woods of northern Minnesota. What makes the situation particularly sensitive is that the bodies are of a black man and a white woman, and they're naked. ""Lynching"" is the word that everybody's trying not to say — but, as Lucas begins to discover, in fact the murders are nothing like what they appear to be, and they are not the end of it. There is worse to come — much, much worse.Filled with rich characterization and exceptional drama that are his hallmarks, this is Sandford's most suspenseful novel yet.

Netherland,,"['Fiction', 'New York', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literature', 'Book Club', 'Sports', 'Unfinished', 'American']","In a New York City made phantasmagorical by the events of 9/11, Hans--a banker originally from the Netherlands--finds himself marooned among the strange occupants of the Chelsea Hotel after his English wife and son return to London. Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an “other” New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck’s particular brand of naivete and chutzpah--by his ability to hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider’s vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man--of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory.

Das musste auch Judith Hermann erfahren und ließ Kritiker und Leser über vier Jahre auf ein zweites Buch warten. Aber das Warten hat sich gelohnt: Wem Sommerhaus, später gefallen hat, wird von den neuen Erzählungen dieser Meisterin der gepflegten Schwermut begeistert sein. In sieben Variationen ihres Lieblingsthemas der unglücklichen Liebe und der allgemeinen Verlorenheit im Leben schickt Judith Hermann ihre Figuren in die Welt hinaus, obwohl den meisten das Reisen so suspekt ist wie der jungen Frau aus ""Aqua Alta"": ""Zwei oder drei Tage vor dem Beginn einer Reise werde ich ängstlich, ohne Grund, alles scheint mir sinnlos, die Ferne, die Fremde, die Kontinente nicht anders als jeder Blick aus meinem Fenster, vier Wochen in einem unbekannten Land, wozu, denke ich, was soll da anders sein und was soll es mir nützen..."" Venedig, Prag und Karlsbad, die Wüste Nevadas, Island oder das Norwegen nördlich des Polarkreises -- in sämtlichen Erzählungen wird die gewohnte Umgebung hinter sich gelassen, und sei es auch nur eine Fahrt in die deutsche Provinz, wohin die Icherzählerin aus ""Ruth (Freundinnen)"" reist und sich in den Geliebten der besten Freundin verknallt. Nichts als Gespenster -- gespenstisch wirken die Hermann'schen Figuren tatsächlich oft, in ihrer Orientierungslosigkeit und Indifferenz, mit der sie durch ihr Dasein laufen. Inhaltlich und stilistisch setzt die junge Berlinerin, die Sommerhaus, später mit einem Schlag zur erfolgreichen und gefeierten Autorin machte, auf das gleiche Pferd. Warum auch nicht. Andererseits hat sie sich durchaus weiter entwickelt: Ihre Geschichten sind länger (bis zu 60 Seiten) und durch den häufigen Einsatz unterschiedlicher Zeitebenen komplexer geworden. Und selbst einzelne Momente der Seeligkeit gönnt sie ihren Figuren nun hin und wieder, wie am Ende von ""Die Liebe zu Ari Oskarsson"", der letzten der sieben durchweg gelungenen Erzählungen: ""... und wir legten die Köpfe in den Nacken und sahen das Nordlicht an, ins All geschleuderte Materie, ein Haufen heißer Elektronen, zerborstene Sterne, was weiß denn ich.

For so long—for years that seemed to go on forever—I couldn't bear to be touched. I put up not just walls but whole stone bunkers to keep everyone out, emotionally, and physically as well.

BOOK DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S HERO is the continuing romantic journey of Adam and Karla, which began in MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY'S ANGEL. Retired Marine Master Sergeant Adam Montague has battled through four combat zones, but now finds himself retreating from Karla Paxton, who has declared war on his heart. With a significant age difference, he feels he should be her guardian and protector, not her lover. But Karla's knack for turning up in his bed at inopportune times is killing his resolve to do the right thing. Karla isn't the young girl he rescued nine years earlier—something his body reminds him of every chance it gets. Their age difference is only part of the problem. Fifty-year-old Adam has been a collector of lost and vulnerable souls most of his life, but a secret he has run from for more than three decades has kept him emotionally unable to admit love for anyone. Will Karla be able to break through the defenses around his heart and help him put the ghosts from his past to rest? In her all-out war to get Adam to surrender his heart, will the strong-willed Goth singer offer herself as his submissive and, if so, at what cost to herself?

DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S PERFECT is the continuing story of Savannah Gentry (now Savi Baker) and Damian Orlando from MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY’S ANGEL (Rescue Me Saga #1) and NOBODY'S HERO (#2). Savannah/Savi escaped eleven years of abuse at the hands of her father and finally made a safe life for herself and her daughter. But when her father once again threatens her peace of mind—and her daughter’s safety—Savi runs to Damian Orlando for protection. Eight years earlier as Savannah, she shared one perfect day with Damian that changed both their young lives and resulted in a secret she no longer can hide. But being with Damian reawakens repressed memories and feelings she wants to keep buried. After witnessing a scene with Damian on Savi's first night at his private club, however, she begins to wonder if he could help her regain control of her life and reclaim her sexuality and identity. Damian, a wounded warrior, has had his own dragons to fight in life, but has never forgotten Savannah. He will lay down his life to protect her and her daughter, but doesn’t believe he can offer more than that. She deserves a whole man, something he can never be after a firefight in Iraq. Damian has turned to SM to regain control of his life and emotions and fulfills the role of Service Top to “bottoms” at the club. However, he could never deliver those services to Savi, who needs someone gentle and loving, not the man he has become. Will two wounded survivors find love and healing in each other’s arms?

"Nobody Asked Me, But ....",,['Politics'],"Apart from breaking two of my mates' noses (one in the ring and one chasing a 'runner') I used to be known for my stories. And they were all true. I'd come back from distant shores and speak of my adventures.  So much so in fact that people used to say, ""You should write a book.""  My diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That’s all.  But although I’m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein – in ‘Nobody Asked Me’ I touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people.  I’ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough – and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial.  Oh, don’t worry; the humour that my fans seem to enjoy so much is still there, but right now the planet’s spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we’re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people.  So is a comedy writer honestly the best one to challenge some of the perceptions we’re facing nowadays? Well, I’ve always believed that if you can make people laugh then they tend to listen to what you say when you’re serious. And my goal, my life’s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire.  So why the rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. Well ‘Rabbit & Pork’ is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I’ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively – mostly at parties, and generally by my wife.  But why a tin of soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences – family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives.  All these ‘ingredients’ make up our Soup of Life.  Now, when making a soup, once you’ve added an ingredient, it’s forever blended in and you can’t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever. So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it’ll always be part and parcel of your ‘soup.’ And as you add more ingredients the ‘recipe’ of your life evolves, and before you know it you can’t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it’s still there at a deep subliminal level. Remember that.  Some people may not add hatred until they’re in their twenties, and most of us never add it at all.",,,,March 31st 2016,[],Kindle Edition,,B01DQ0M8S2,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459603588l/29760928._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],365.0,4.0,,,,86.0,49.0,275,Karl Wiggins,"['31', '4', '7', '2', '5']",,[],,['Karl Wiggins']

Notes from a Colored Girl: The Civil War Pocket Diaries of Emilie Frances Davis,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir']","In Notes from a Colored Girl, Karsonya Wise Whitehead examines the life and experiences of Emilie Frances Davis, a freeborn twenty-one-year-old mulatto woman, through a close reading of three pocket diaries she kept from 1863 to 1865. Whitehead explores Davis's worldviews and politics, her perceptions of both public and private events, her personal relationships, and her place in Philadelphia's free black community in the nineteenth century. Although Davis's daily entries are sparse, brief snapshots of her life, Whitehead interprets them in ways that situate Davis in historical and literary contexts that illuminate nineteenth-century black American women's experiences. Whitehead's contribution of edited text and original narrative fills a void in scholarly documentation of women who dwelled in spaces between white elites, black entrepreneurs, and urban dwellers of every race and class.Notes from a Colored Girl is a unique offering to the fields of history and documentary editing as the book includes both a six-chapter historical reconstruction of Davis's life and a full, heavily annotated edition of her Civil War-era pocket diaries. Drawing on scholarly traditions from history, literature, feminist studies, and sociolinguistics, Whitehead investigates Davis's diary both as a complete literary artifact and in terms of her specific daily entries.From a historical perspective, Whitehead re-creates the narrative of Davis's life for those three years and analyzes the black community where she lived and worked. From a literary perspective, Whitehead examines Davis's diary as a socially, racially, and gendered nonfiction text. From a feminist studies perspective, she examines Davis's agency and identity, grounded in theories elaborated by black feminist scholars. And, from linguistic and rhetorical perspectives, she studies Davis's discourse about her interpersonal relationships, her work, and external events in her life in an effort to understand how she used language to construct her social, racial, and gendered identities.Since there are few primary sources written by black women during this time in history, Davis's diary--though ordinary in its content--is rendered extraordinary simply because it has survived to be included in this very small class of resources. Whitehead's extensive analysis illuminates the lives of many through the simple words of one.

Newman's message is clear and timely."" --The Philadelphia InquirerIn No Shame in My Game, Harvard anthropologist Katherine Newman gives voice to a population for whom work, family, and self-esteem are top priorities despite all the factors that make earning a living next to impossible--minimum wage, lack of child care and health care, and a desperate shortage of even low-paying jobs. By intimately following the lives of nearly 300 inner-city workers and job seekers for two yearsin Harlem, Newman explores a side of poverty often ignored by media and politicians--the working poor.The working poor find dignity in earning a paycheck and shunning the welfare system, arguing that even low-paying jobs give order to their lives.

Naiseks olemise kunst,,['Nonfiction'],"Rahvasuu naljatab, et Jumal, kes oli maailmaloomise protsessis mehe valmis meisterdanud, silmitses teda hetke ja mõtles: „Ma suudan paremini.“ Ning tegi naise. Väeline naine on jumaliku loomingu kauneim meistritöö. Kuidas aga elada oma elu selliseks, et jumalik läte naises ei kuivaks, et sära aastatega ei tuhmuks, vaid väge tuleks vanusega juurde? Et sellest väest saaks toitu enesehinnang, mis on kõikide suhete aluseks? Selline elu on kunst. Naise süvamaailma allhoovuseid, mis juhivad ta mõtlemist, tundmusi ja käitumist, võib kutsuda naise arhetüüpideks. Eluterved arhetüübid muudavad naise väeliseks, variarhetüübid kahandavad ta väetiks. Arhetüübid – Tütarlaps, Armastaja, Perenaine ja Kuninganna – avalduvad naise elu erinevates tahkudes. Tütarlaps toob naise ellu emotsionaalsuse, elurõõmu, mängu ja liikuvuse, tantsu ja spordi. Sensuaalse Armastaja abil astub naine füüsilisse kontakti mehega. Perenaine kannab naise elus hoolt tema perekondlike suhete, koduhoiu, puhtuse ja enda sisemise maailma hoidmise eest. Kuninganna ilmneb suhetes välismaailmaga, oma väärtuse teadmises ning oma seisukohtade selges ja julges avaldamises. Arhetüüpide palett on igal naisel sünnihetkel olemas, see on justkui tema Ürgnaise kood, mis peaks tagama täisverelise elu. Paraku juhtub elu käigus sageli, et naine hälbib elutervetest arhetüüpidest variarhetüüpide küüsi. Temas on eluterve arhetüübi energiat kas liiga vähe või vastupidi, liiga palju. Mis on need põhjused, miks naine kaotab kontakti väeliste arhetüüpidega? Milliseid arhetüüpe mehed suhetes naistega otsivad? Milliseid arhetüüpe vajab naine suhete õnnestumiseks? Millised variarhetüübid toovad garanteeritult kinnijäämise negatiivsetesse emotsioonidesse? „Naiseks olemise kunst“ viib lugeja naise psüühika inglite ja deemonite – arhetüüpide ja variarhetüüpide – juurde. Lootuses, et varjupoolte teadvustamise ja elutervete arhetüüpide väljendamise kaudu saab naine uurida end uuest vaatevinklist ja parema kunstilise tulemuse nimel ehk muuta oma elu.Raamatu süvapsühholoogiline sisu on esitatud erakordselt lihtsalt ja selgelt ning see on põnev lugemistükk neilegi, kes akadeemilisest psühholoogiast kauge kaarega mööda käivad. Katrin Saali Saul on suurepärane jutustaja, tema mahlakas keel ja võrratud kujundid avavad naise hingeelu salasoppe sügavamalt kui keegi eales varem on suutnud teha. Igaühel on siit midagi võtta. See on suurepärane käsiraamat naistele, kes on parasjagu iseendaga vaenujalal või vajavad suhete klaarimise õpetust, rõõmuks neile, kes eluga kenasti hakkama saavad, kuid vajavad juurde vürtsi ja värvi.

Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall,,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Music', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Japan', 'British Literature', 'Japanese Literature', 'Audiobook']","One of the most celebrated writers of our time gives us his first cycle of short fiction: five brilliantly etched, interconnected stories in which music is a vivid and essential character. A once-popular singer, desperate to make a comeback, turning from the one certainty in his life . . . A man whose unerring taste in music is the only thing his closest friends value in him . . . A struggling singer-songwriter unwittingly involved in the failing marriage of a couple he’s only just met . . . A gifted, underappreciated jazz musician who lets himself believe that plastic surgery will help his career . . . A young cellist whose tutor promises to “unwrap” his talent . . . Passion or necessity—or the often uneasy combination of the two—determines the place of music in each of these lives. And, in one way or another, music delivers each of them to a moment of reckoning: sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, sometimes just eluding their grasp.

Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society.

"Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time",,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Communication', 'Buisness', 'Management']","Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. In ""Never Eat Alone,"" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him. The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with ""networking."" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: Don't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too. ""Ping"" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- ""invisibility"" is a fate worse than failure. In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a ""conference commando,"" and more, ""Never Eat Alone"" is destined to take its place alongside ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as an inspirational classic.",,,10/30/05,February 22nd 2005,[],Hardcover,,9780385512053,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320417949l/84699.jpg,3.86,[],97.0,1.0,,,,89.0,41202.0,309,Crown Business,"['14025', '13073', '9744', '3066', '1294']",,[],,['Keith Ferrazzi']

It’s a world of Indian towns, white roadside cafes, and abandoned roads that swirl with the memories of the Ghost Dance and Sitting Bull. Readers meet vivid characters like Jumbo, a 400-pound mechanic, and Annie, an 80-year-old Lakota woman living in a log cabin. Threading through the book is the story of two men struggling to find a common voice. Neither Wolf nor Dog takes readers to the heart of the Native American experience.

Never Goodbye,,"['New Adult', 'Romance', 'High School', 'Young Adult']","If you had one chance to be with your soul mate, would you fight for it? Sometimes the hardest fight isn't finding love, sometimes its fighting against the ticking clock of your life. Stalked by the shadow of a foreboding disease, seventeen year old, Harper Kennedy finds herself starting a new life in Albany Missouri. With a ticking time bomb, a wall of quotes, a shell of a father and a brother who has no one else, Harper tries to get life in order for those she may be leaving behind. But fate is cruel when it delivers temptation in the form of  Vaun Campbell into her life; Vaun who is kind and sweet and completely out of her league on so many levels. How can Harper find love only to have it ripped away so soon? How can she put Vaun, who has faced more than his own fair share of loss and grief in the past, through all that again? …How can she not? Vaun Campbell has been to hell and back again after losing his mother. He has seen the way disease destroys the ones he loves…has seen them fade before his eyes. He never thought he’d find someone to bring the sunshine back to his life until he laid eyes on Harper; the graceful girl he watched float across the dance floor, who stole a little piece of his heart forever.  So Harper must fight for more than just her life, she must fight for her little brother, her father and for Vaun; who promises her a future.EXCERPT: I want him to. I want it so bad I almost scream it. What I do is pop on my tip toes and shatter any remnants of a line I had drawn with a kiss to end all kisses.My fingers drive into his hair and his into mine. His tongue sweeps across my lips and I let him in and, holy shit, I’m on fire. I have kissed before and never had this feeling. Vaun is constantly breaking my nevers and, at the rate we are going, I won’t have any left before I die.And that one thought is the cold bucket of water I need and hate because I want to keep kissing this boy until he’s had enough of me. But I’m dying. While I’m kissing him, I’m dying. While I’m thinking about dying, I’m dying and that just isn’t fair on a boy who has already faced that kind of loss. I pull my mouth from his and sit on the edge of my bed with my hand over my mouth.“Blue, don’t.” He squats on his knees in front of me, his hands on my hips and he’s looking at me with sad, brown eyes. I shake my head. I don’t want to see him. “Don’t deny us this. Whatever it is that you’re not ready to tell me, we’ll work through it with time. Just let us get through tonight and take each day at a time.”But we don’t have the luxury of time. We have the ticking of a clock and an undeniable need for each other that’s so unfathomable and so unfair. I close my eyes, unable to look at him anymore. It hurts too much and I feel the waver.“Harper, I have been carrying such a heavy load of life, I need this. I promise you that if there comes a time where you feel we can’t do this, then I will give it to you. No fight, no pleading. I will give you up if you want, but right now, give us tonight and we can take it one night at a time, one day, one hour, one minute … every second.”",Albany Boys #1,,08/13/13,,[],,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364340827l/17696042.jpg,4.04,[],76.0,1.0,,,,90.0,262.0,,,"['114', '76', '47', '18', '7']",,"['Albany, Missouri (United States)']",,['Kerri Williams']

Not Quite What I Was Planning: Six-Word Memoirs by Writers Famous and Obscure,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Short Stories', 'Poetry', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Writing', 'Biography Memoir', 'Anthologies']","Deceptively simple and surprisingly addictive, Not Quite What I Was Planning is a thousand glimpses of humanity—six words at a time.When Ernest Hemingway famously wrote, ""For Sale: baby shoes, never worn,"" he proved that an entire story can be told using a half-dozen words. When the online storytelling magazine SMITH asked readers to submit six-word memoirs, they proved a whole, real life can be told this way, too. The results are fascinating, hilarious, shocking, and moving. From small sagas of bittersweet romance (""Found true love, married someone else"") to proud achievements and stinging regrets (""After Harvard, had baby with crackhead""), these terse true tales relate the diversity of human experience in tasty bite-size pieces.

These nine perfect strangers are about to find out...Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer—or should she run while she still can?It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.Combining all of the hallmarks that have made Liane Moriarty's writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, Nine Perfect Strangers once again shows why she is a master of her craft.",,,09/18/18,November 6th 2018,"['Masha (Maria) Dmitrichenko', 'Frances Welty', 'Jessica Chandler', 'Ben Chandler', 'Heather Marconi', 'Napoleon Marconi', 'Zoe Marconi', 'Tony Hogburn', 'Carmel Schneider', 'Lars Lee', 'Yao']",Hardcover,,9781250069825,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529076901l/39280445.jpg,3.51,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2018)'],530.0,6.0,,,,86.0,241645.0,453,Flatiron Books,"['38142', '86384', '84014', '25625', '7480']",,['Australia'],,['Liane Moriarty']

Nomad: A Year In the Life of a Qashqa'i Tribesman in Iran,,[],"Borzu Qermezi was the headman and political leader of a group of nomadic pastoralists who were part of the Qashqa'i confederacy of southwest Iran. Proud, complex, strong-willed, witty, and cunning, Borzu successfully led his people on their annual migrations for many years. He regulated their travel; mediated conflicts; intervened in (and sometimes exacerbated) tense situations between his people and other nomads; and dealt with the government police agency. Structuring the account around the four seasons, Lois Beck recounts the day-to-day activities of Borzu during the year she spent traveling with his people. She describes the rigors of nomadic life and the consequences of decisions made in haste.During 1970 to 1971, Borzu and his people were faced with many difficulties. When the expected winter rains did not fall, pastures and crops shriveled. Unable to sell their starving livestock for any profit, Borzu's people saw their debts to urban merchants and moneylenders increase. At the same time, Iran exercised more bureaucratic control over the Qashqa'i by applying new policies over migratory schedules and the allocation of scarce pastures, and by introducing non-Qashqa'i agriculturalists and livestock investors as legitimate land users. All these measures threatened the nomad's way of life and eventually undermined the role of headmen such as Borzu. Lois Beck details the vicissitudes endured by Borzu's people and the strategies he devised to cope with them.Blending ethnographic and historical material, this book contains information unavailable for other tribal and nomadic pastoral groups in the Middle East and central Asia. Through Beck's deft analysis, we come to understand why nomadic pastoralism was once an important part of this vast region, and why tribal society has endured.",,,November 19th 1991,December 19th 1991,[],Hardcover,,9780520070035,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266806336l/2417663.jpg,3.13,[],4.0,1.0,,,,62.0,8.0,482,University of California Press,"['1', '2', '2', '3', '0']",,[],,['Lois Beck']

With the unanticipated romance with her best friend, and the unforeseen friendship with her brother’s acquaintance, Emi sees a new future unfolding right before her pale green eyes. Her optimism returning, she is gaining more confidence in her emotions, and she welcomes her newfound happiness. Jack Holland is elated that Emi has allowed him into her life. For him, it was love at first sight when they met in college, and after years of keeping his feelings in check at the advice of his best friend, he is finally free to express to Emi exactly how she affects him. Always practical and level-headed, the growing romance inspires Jack to let down his guard. His patience rewarded, everything appears to be falling into place until Emi delivers shocking news to Jack that will force him to reevaluate his priorities. Knowing what he’s always wanted in life, he has to decide what he’s willing to sacrifice to be with the woman he loves – even if he’s not always certain his feelings are returned. In the conclusion to Emi Lost & Found, Jack guides Emi through a year of self-discovery, and teaches her that faith in true love – and in soul mates – can yield happiness from even the darkest of places.

  “I can’t wait anymore.” His mouth claimed hers in a storm of heat and power.
  Carter Pierce is a man who believes in signs. He just doesn't know what to do with this one.  In the small town of Blue Moon Bend, where everybody is a matchmaker, Carter wants to be left alone to tend the family farm. After returning from Afghanistan with scars, his only goal is recovery.

Nullpunkt,,"['Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction']","«Nullpunkt» on aus ja ilustamata romaan 21. sajandi algusaastate Eesti koolinoorte elust. Peategelasel, probleemsest kodust ja halvast koolist pärit Johannesel õnnestub end ühte Tallinna eliitkooli sisse rääkida, kuid peagi avastab eluterve ja hea huumorimeelega poiss eneselegi üllatuseks, et erinevate kokkusattumuste tõttu on ta klassikaaslaste poolt jõuliselt heidikustaatusse tagandatud ning tema ees seisab vankumatu sotsiaalne blokaad. Esialgu proovib Johannes küll enda mainet päästa, kuid nagu rabalaukas üksida rappides vajub üha sügavamale ja sügavamale, kuni põhja enam pole ja lootust ei paista. Kui tema elupüramiidi kolm peamist tahku – kodu, sõbrad ja kool – kokku vajuvad, avastab poiss, et elu ei ole sellisena enam elamist väärt ning nurkasurutuna, emotsionaalselt ja füüsiliselt läbiklobituna mõistab, et tal ei ole enam midagi kaotada. Ta jõuab nullpunkti. Ta ei taha enam elada, kuid leiab end kogudes enesetapule alternatiivse lahenduse: ta hakkab enda elu looma selliseks, nagu ise tahab. Johannes ei proovi muuta tingimusi enda ümber, vaid kohandab ennast just selliseks, nagu vaja. Ta töötab välja skeemi, kuidas saavutada populaarsus ja aktsepteeritus ning hakkab seda mineviku survest ja oleviku löökidest hoolimata jõuliselt rakendama. Kirjanik Jim Ashilevi: «Nullpunkt» on raamat ülesaamisest. See on häbenematu ülestähendus ühest põrgust, kuhu «erilised» koolinoored päevast päeva saadetakse ja kust mõned neist iial välja ei tule. See raamat saavutab kõige raskema – sellest põrgust väljatuleku ja seda on raske pidada vähemaks kui suursaavutuseks. Õigupoolest võib raamatu kangelast kannustav tahe mõjuda küüniliste ja irooniliste stsenaariumidega harjunud inimesele võõristavaltki. See on lugu ohjade haaramisest. Mitte oma elu välja teenimisest, vaid oma elu tegemisest. Otsusest olla see, kes oled. Otsusest olla hea. Tahtest olla õnnelik ilma, et keegi seda õpetada oskaks. See on saamislugu. Pole kahtlust, et see raamat jõuab vähemalt ühe noore inimeseni nagu köis sügavasse pimedasse kaanetatud kaevu. Ja mitte poomiseks, vaid selleks, et tulla välja päikese kätte. Sest kõigil on koht päikese all. Ja päikesel on sinust ükskõik. Aga sina armasta teda sellegipoolest, teadagi miks. Ja võib juhtuda, et kaevust välja tulles pole sind tervitamas päike, vaid lägane vilisev hall Eesti sügistalv. Siis hangid vihmavarju ja head saapad.

Son los años de la junta militar, hay controles de soldados armados y tensión en el ambiente. El hijo se llama Gaspar y el padre trata de protegerlo del destino que le ha sido asignado. La madre murió en circunstancias poco claras, en un accidente que acaso no lo fue.Como su padre, Gaspar está llamado a ser un médium en una sociedad secreta, la Orden, que contacta con la Oscuridad en busca de la vida eterna mediante atroces rituales. En ellos es vital disponer de un médium, pero el destino de estos seres dotados de poderes especiales es cruel, porque su desgaste físico y mental es rápido e implacable. Los orígenes de la Orden, regida por la poderosa familia de la madre de Gaspar, se remontan a siglos atrás, cuando el conocimiento de la Oscuridad llegó desde el corazón de África a Inglaterra y desde allí se extendió hasta Argentina.El lector encontrará en estas páginas casas cuyo interior muta; pasadizos que esconden monstruos inimaginables; rituales con fieros y extáticos sacrificios humanos; andanzas en el Londres psicodélico de los años sesenta, donde la madre de Gaspar conoció a un joven cantante de aire andrógino llamado David; párpados humanos convertidos en fetiches; enigmáticas liturgias sexuales; la relación entre padres e hijos, con la carga de una herencia atroz; y, de fondo, la represión de la dictadura militar, los desaparecidos y, más adelante, la incierta llegada de la democracia, los primeros brotes del sida en Buenos Aires...

Night Film,,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Horror', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Adult', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction']","On a damp October night, 24-year-old Ashley Cordova is found dead in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding Ashley's life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror film director Stanislaus Cordova--a man who hasn't been seen in public for more than thirty years. For McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about Cordova's dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself.

"Nature Via Nurture: Genes, Experience and What Makes Us Human",,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Genetics', 'Popular Science', 'Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology']","Acclaimed author Matt Ridley's thrilling follow-up to his bestseller Genome. Armed with the extraordinary new discoveries about our genes, Ridley turns his attention to the nature versus nurture debate to bring the first popular account of the roots of human behaviour. What makes us who we are?In February 2001 it was announced that the genome contains not 100,000 genes as originally expected but only 30,000. This startling revision led some scientists to conclude that there are simply not enough human genes to account for all the different ways people behave: we must be made by nurture, not nature. Matt Ridley argues that the emerging truth is far more interesting than this myth. Nurture depends on genes, too, and genes need nurture. Genes not only predetermine the broad structure of the brain; they also absorb formative experiences, react to social cues and even run memory. after the discovery of the double helix of DNA, Nature via Nurture chronicles a new revolution in our understanding of genes. Ridley recounts the hundred years' war between the partisans of nature and nurture to explain how this paradoxical creature, the human being, can be simultaneously free-willed and motivated by instinct and culture. Nature via Nurture is an enthralling, up-to-the-minute account of how genes build brains to absorb experience.",,,2003,May 1st 2004,[],Paperback,,9781841157467,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348690229l/80035.jpg,4.06,[],18.0,1.0,,,,94.0,3833.0,328,Harper Perennial,"['1450', '1440', '728', '156', '59']",,[],,['Matt Ridley']

Ambitious, charismatic, and beautiful, Nefertiti is destined to marry Amunhotep, an unstable young pharaoh. It is hoped by all that her strong personality will temper the young Amunhotep's heretical desire to forsake Egypt's ancient gods, overthrow the priests of Amun, and introduce a new sun god for all to worship. From the moment of her arrival in Thebes, Nefertiti is beloved by the people. Her charisma is matched only by her husband's perceived generosity: Amunhotep showers his subjects with lofty promises. The love of the commoners will not be enough, however, if the royal couple is not able to conceive an heir, and as Nefertiti turns her attention to producing a son, she fails to see that the powerful priests, along with the military, are plotting against her husband's rule. The only person wise enough to recognize the shift in political winds--and brave enough to tell the queen--is her younger sister, Mutnodjmet.Observant and contemplative, Mutnodjmet has never shared her sister's desire for power. She yearns for a quiet existence away from family duty and the intrigues of court. Her greatest hope is to share her life with the general who has won her heart. But as Nefertiti learns of the precariousness of her reign, she declares that her sister must remain at court and marry for political gain, not love. To achieve her independence, Mutnodjmet must defy her sister, the most powerful woman in Egypt, while also remaining loyal to the needs of her family. Love, betrayal, political unrest, plague, and religious conflict, Nefertiti brings ancient Egypt to life in vivid detail. Fast-paced and historically accurate, it is the dramatic story of two unforgettable women living through a remarkable period in history.",,,10/28/07,July 10th 2007,"['Akhenaten', 'Nefertiti', 'Mutnodjmet']",Hardcover,,9780307381460,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449831l/481446.jpg,4.07,[],872.0,12.0,,,,94.0,34037.0,463,Crown Publishing Group,"['12941', '12825', '6310', '1478', '483']",,[],,['Michelle Moran']

As the hapless Thelonious keeps ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time, he attracts the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Horatio Sidebottom of Norfolk Constabulary CID, who’s determined to tie Thelonious to the crimes. Add in a pair of hoods from London’s East End, celebrity TV chef Paolo Louis Black, and plenty of oddball local characters and it all adds up to a madcap journey through England’s most quirky county, where everything is normal for Norfolk!From bestselling author Mitzi Szereto, co-authored with her celebrity sidekick bear Teddy Tedaloo.“For anyone who’s ever wondered what Paddington at Large would have been like if it had been written by Raymond Chandler—and who hasn’t?—Mitzi Szereto has the answer. Like Philip Marlowe, Szereto’s Thelonious T. Bear is a modern knight errant who plays it cool even as the light of suspicion shines on him.

With her best friend Zeb’s Titanic-themed wedding looming ahead, new vampire Jane Jameson struggles to develop her budding relationship with her enigmatic sire, Gabriel.

Not Just a Pretty Face,Dolls and Human Figurines in Alaska Native Cultures,Antiques & Collectibles,"Now in a full-color second edition, Not Just a Pretty Face is an engaging exploration of the role of dolls and doll making in Alaska Native cultures. From ancient ivory carvings to the thriving tourist market, dolls and human figurines have played integral parts in the ritual, economic, and social lives of Native Alaskans. Dolls served as children’s playthings, represented absent community members at ceremonies, and predicted the movements of game animals for shamans. Not Just a Pretty Face surveys these and other uses of dolls and figurines, illustrating in beautiful color photographs the diversity of the doll-making tradition in Eskimo, Athabaskan, and Northwest Coast Native communities. Authors explore the ethnographic literature, twentieth-century oral histories, and photographic documentation of dolls and the doll-making process. Contemporary doll makers explain, in their own words, how they learned to make dolls and what doll making means to them. The second edition features a photo essay on Rosalie Paniyak of Chevak, one of the most influential doll makers in Alaska today. Not Just a Pretty Face provides a panoramic view of an ancient tradition and situates the art of doll making within a contemporary context. Scholarly, yet accessible, Not Just a Pretty Face is a lively contribution to the literature on dolls, anthropology, and Native studies.",,,,2006.0,,,1889963852,9781889963853,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_3Pn-oDS850C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.5,,,,,,,,,80.0,,,2.0,,,['Molly Lee']

When Nate Wilson looks at the world around him, he asks ""What is this place? Why is this place? Who approved it? Am I supposed to take it seriously?"" What could such an outlandish, fantastical world say about its Creator?  In these sparkling chapters, Wilson gives an aesthetic examination of the ways in which humanity has tried to make sense of this overwhelming carnival ride of a world. He takes a whimsical, thought-provoking look at everything from the ""magic"" of quantum physics, to nature's absurdities, to the problem of evil, evolution and hell. These frequently humorous, and uniquely beautiful portraits express reality unknown to many Christians-the reality of God's story unfolding around and among us.

First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, this is an infuriating, inspiring, and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money, marketing, and the anti-corporate movement.As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe—witness today's schoolbooks, superstores, sporting arenas, and brand-name synergy—a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative, well-written study, a front-line report on that battle, we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor, how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how ""culture jammers"" utilize spray paint, computer-hacking acumen, and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in ""Joe Chemo"" for ""Joe Camel"").No Logo will challenge and enlighten students of sociology, economics, popular culture, international affairs, and marketing.""This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government.

Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.",,,02/07/17,March 6th 2018,"['Odin', 'Thor (Norse Mythology)', 'Loki']",Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516128292l/37903770._SX318_.jpg,4.08,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy (2017)'],1139.0,13.0,,,,96.0,214833.0,301,W.

Writing each day for the ""Mass Observation"" project, Nella, a middle-aged housewife from the bombed town of Barrow, shows what people really felt during this time. This was the period in which she turned 50, saw her children leave home, and reviewed her life and her marriage - which she eventually compares to slavery. Her growing confidence as a result of her war work makes this a moving (though often comic) testimony, which, covering sex, death and fear of invasion, provides a new, unglamorised, female perspective on the war years.

Now, in Natasha's Dance, internationally renowned historian Orlando Figes does the same for Russian culture, summoning the myriad elements that formed a nation and held it together.Beginning in the eighteenth century with the building of St. Petersburg-a ""window on the West""-and culminating with the challenges posed to Russian identity by the Soviet regime, Figes examines how writers, artists, and musicians grappled with the idea of Russia itself-its character, spiritual essence, and destiny. He skillfully interweaves the great works-by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall-with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world. Figes's characters range high and low: the revered Tolstoy, who left his deathbed to search for the Kingdom of God, as well as the serf girl Praskovya, who became Russian opera's first superstar and shocked society by becoming her owner's wife. Like the European-schooled countess Natasha performing an impromptu folk dance in Tolstoy's War and Peace, the spirit of ""Russianness"" is revealed by Figes as rich and uplifting, complex and contradictory-a powerful force that unified a vast country and proved more lasting than any Russian ruler or state.",,,10/30/02,October 17th 2003,[],Paperback,,9780312421953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388803938l/97401.jpg,4.2,['Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2003)'],99.0,1.0,,,,96.0,3056.0,729,Picador,"['1313', '1190', '439', '82', '32']",,[],,['Orlando Figes']

A major hit in Germany that went on to become one of Europe’s biggest literary blockbusters in the last five years, Night Train to Lisbon is an astonishing novel, a compelling exploration of consciousness, the possibility of truly understanding another person, and the ability of language to define our very selves. Raimund Gregorius is a Latin teacher at a Swiss college who one day—after a chance encounter with a mysterious Portuguese woman—abandons his old life to start a new one. He takes the night train to Lisbon and carries with him a book by Amadeu de Prado, a (fictional) Portuguese doctor and essayist whose writings explore the ideas of loneliness, mortality, death, friendship, love, and loyalty. Gregorius becomes obsessed by what he reads and restlessly struggles to comprehend the life of the author. His investigations lead him all over the city of Lisbon, as he speaks to those who were entangled in Prado’s life. Gradually, the picture of an extraordinary man emerges—a doctor and poet who rebelled against Salazar’s dictatorship.",,,10/28/04,December 21st 2007,['Raimund Gregorius'],Hardcover,,9780802118585,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388511706l/1528410.jpg,3.75,['Premio Grinzane Cavour for Narrativa Straniera (2007)'],673.0,8.0,,,,86.0,18320.0,496,Grove Press,"['5364', '6315', '4099', '1742', '800']",,[],,"['Pascal Mercier', 'Barbara Harshav']"

An elderly widower who has lived through three wars and fought in two of them, the captain enjoys his rootless, solitary existence.In Wichita Falls, he is offered a $50 gold piece to deliver a young orphan to her relatives in San Antonio. Four years earlier, a band of Kiowa raiders killed Johanna’s parents and sister; sparing the little girl, they raised her as one of their own. Recently rescued by the U.S. army, the ten-year-old has once again been torn away from the only home she knows.Their 400-mile journey south through unsettled territory and unforgiving terrain proves difficult and at times dangerous. Johanna has forgotten the English language, tries to escape at every opportunity, throws away her shoes, and refuses to act “civilized.” Yet as the miles pass, the two lonely survivors tentatively begin to trust each other, forming a bond that marks the difference between life and death in this treacherous land.Arriving in San Antonio, the reunion is neither happy nor welcome.

Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Chemistry', 'Popular Science', 'History Of Science', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'School', 'Science Nature']","Though many factors have been proposed to explain the failure of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign, it has also been linked to something as small as a button - a tin button, the kind that fastened everything from the greatcoats of Napoleon's officers to the trousers of his foot soldiers. When temperatures drop below 56°F, tin crumbles into powder. Were the soldiers of the Grande Armée acutee fatally weakened by cold because the buttons of their uniforms fell apart? How different our world might be if tin did not disintegrate at low temperatures and the French had continued their eastward expansion!  This fascinating book tells the stories of seventeen molecules that, like the tin of those buttons, greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration and made possible the ensuing voyages of discovery. They resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine; lie behind changes in gender roles, in law, and in the environment; and have determined what we today eat, drink, and wear.  Showing how a change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous differences in the properties of a substance, the authors reveal the astonishing chemical connections among seemingly unrelated events.

Nelson Mandela: A Biography,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']","Everyone should know the life story of Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders of all time, the first black president of South Africa, the most famous African, and a major world statesman. His inspiring life receives a fresh retelling in this new biography written especially for students and general readers. This volume is an enjoyable, authoritative, and balanced way to not only understand a great man, but also to understand a critical time in world history and race relations. Mandela's quest for racial justice for black South Africans as a leader of the African National Congress led to twenty-seven years of imprisonment. South African Apartheid consumed the attention of the world, coming to a head in the 1980s. With intense international pressure on the Apartheid government, Mandela was finally freed in 1990. Through the landmark presidency of South Africa and post Nobel Peace Prize years up until today, he has continued as a peacemaker and agent for change.Chapter 1 covers his birth into a strong Xhosa family and clan, with cultural, historical, and geographical context, and the next chapter follows his elite education path, taking into consideration the forces and people who helped shape the future leader. Chapter 3 discusses his law practice, African National Congress work, and his first wife. Chapters 4-6 continue with his growing political involvement and family. Chapter 7 and 8 deal with the long imprisonment and then freedom. The final chapters discuss his presidency and Nobel Peace Prize and life today.

Nemesis,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Americana', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish']","In the “stifling heat of equatorial Newark,” a terrifying epidemic is raging, threatening the children of the New Jersey city with maiming, paralysis, lifelong disability, and even death. This is the startling theme of Philip Roth’s wrenching new book: a wartime polio epidemic in the summer of 1944 and the effect it has on a closely knit, family-oriented Newark community and its children. At the center of Nemesis is a vigorous, dutiful twenty-three-year-old playground director, Bucky Cantor, a javelin thrower and weightlifter, who is devoted to his charges and disappointed with himself because his weak eyes have excluded him from serving in the war alongside his contemporaries. Focusing on Cantor’s dilemmas as polio begins to ravage his playground—and on the everyday realities he faces—Roth leads us through every inch of emotion such a pestilence can breed: the fear, the panic, the anger, the bewilderment, the suffering, and the pain. Moving between the smoldering, malodorous streets of besieged Newark and Indian Hill, a pristine children’s summer camp high in the Poconos—whose “mountain air was purified of all contaminants”—Roth depicts a decent, energetic man with the best intentions struggling in his own private war against the epidemic. Roth is tenderly exact at every point about Cantor’s passage into personal disaster, and no less exact about the condition of childhood. Through this story runs the dark questions that haunt all four of Roth’s late short novels, Everyman, Indignation, The Humbling, and now Nemesis: What kind of accidental choices fatally shape a life?

Pliny himself died while investigating the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii in AD 79, and the natural curiosity that brought about his death is also very much evident in the Natural History — a book that proved highly influential right up until the Renaissance and that his nephew, Pliny the younger, described ‘as full of variety as nature itself’.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions.

No Ordinary Genius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman,,"['Science', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Mathematics', 'Popular Science', 'Memoir']","With a unique combination of dazzling intellect and touching simplicity, Feynman had a passion for physics that was merely the Nobel Prize-winning part of an immense love of life and everything it could offer. He was hugely irreverent and always completely honest—with himself, with his colleagues, and with nature.No Ordinary Genius traces Feynman's remarkable adventures inside and outside science, in words and more than one-hundred photographs, many of them supplied by his family and close friends. The words are often his own and those of family, friends, and colleagues such as his sister, Joan Feynman; his children, Carl and Michelle; Freeman Dyson; Hans Bethe; Daniel Hillis; Marvin Minsky; and John Archibald Wheeler. The book gives vivid insight into the mind of a great creative scientist at work and at play, and it challenges the popular myth of the scientist as a cold reductionist dedicated to stripping romance and mystery from the natural world.

Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Sociology', 'Economics', 'Anthropology', 'Social Science']","In his bestselling The Moral Animal, Robert Wright applied the principles of evolutionary biology to the study of the human mind. Now Wright attempts something even more ambitious: explaining the direction of evolution and human history–and discerning where history will lead us next.In Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Wright asserts that, ever since the primordial ooze, life has followed a basic pattern. Organisms and human societies alike have grown more complex by mastering the challenges of internal cooperation. Wright's narrative ranges from fossilized bacteria to vampire bats, from stone-age villages to the World Trade Organization, uncovering such surprises as the benefits of barbarian hordes and the useful stability of feudalism. Here is history endowed with moral significance–a way of looking at our biological and cultural evolution that suggests, refreshingly, that human morality has improved over time, and that our instinct to discover meaning may itself serve a higher purpose. Insightful, witty, profound, Nonzero offers breathtaking implications for what we believe and how we adapt to technology's ongoing transformation of the world.From the Trade Paperback edition.",,,10/30/99,,[],Kindle Edition,,B000Q9IRBY,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387753121l/9526993.jpg,3.99,[],97.0,1.0,,,,93.0,2324.0,450,,"['812', '875', '478', '121', '38']",,[],,['Robert Wright']

But even though she was thousands of miles away from the United States, completely on her own in this tiny village in the West African nation of Cote d'Ivoire, she did not feel like a stranger for long. As her vivid narrative unfolds, Erdman draws us into the changing world of the village that became her home. Here is a place where electricity is expected but never arrives, where sorcerers still conjure magic, where the tok-tok sound of women grinding corn with pestles rings out in the mornings like church bells. Rare rains provoke bathing in the streets and the most coveted fashion trend is fabric with illustrations of Western cell phones. Yet Nambonkaha is also a place where AIDS threatens and poverty is constant, where women suffer the indignities of patriarchal customs, where children work like adults while still managing to dream. Lyrical and topical, Erdman's beautiful debut captures the astonishing spirit of an unforgettable community.

Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction.

Nightmarish Sacrifice,,[],"Unpredictable. Symbolic. Mysterious. NIGHTMARISH SACRIFICE. A sinister nightmare repeats for the thirteenth time in a row. A sacrificed ghost is weeping on her own abandoned grave, disturbing Freya's dreams... and secret nightmares. A mask of invincibility is rising between a boy and the girl who loves him. Hypnotizing and intense, penetratingly gray as dead starless skies, Cardew's brutally beautiful eyes block his soul behind themselves like lurid mystifying mirrors that can flawlessly reflect others' feelings without showing any of his own... Assuming he ever had such. Nobody knows what hides behind his mask of a hero - least of all his lovely Freya, who lets her obsessions disguised as intuition lead her into his mesmerising labyrinth of insanity and love. When a million masks become the actor's face and they all explode in a single moment, what happens to his uncompromising pride? Best enemies can make the best of friends - but the worst of lovers.

Ali kao i druge žene - one koje nije volela - dozvolila je da je iscede muž, sin, kuća...Novela koju Simon de Bovoar nije želela da objavi zbog očiglednih aluzija na njen privatni život sa Sartrom.Nesporazum u Moskvi govori o bračnoj krizi i krizi indentiteta kroz koju Nikol i Andre, bračni par profesora u penziji, prolaze za vrijeme putovanja u moskvu.

Born into slavery in 1797, Truth fled from bondage some 30 years later to become a powerful figure in the progressive movements reshaping American society.This remarkable narrative, first published in 1850, offers a rare glimpse into the little-documented world of Northern slavery. Truth recounts her life as a slave in rural New York, her separation from her family, her religious conversion, and her life as a traveling preacher during the 1840s. She also describes her work as a social reformer, counselor of former slaves, and sponsor of a black migration to the West.A spellbinding orator and implacable prophet, Truth mesmerized audiences with her tales of life in bondage and with her moving renditions of Methodist hymns and her own songs. Frederick Douglass described her message as a ""strange compound of wit and wisdom, of wild enthusiasm, and flint-like common sense.""

As Harper gripped the bars of her cage, in the alien prison; it sunk in that she seriously had been kidnapped from Earth, to become the fated consort of some alien prince. This wasn’t some elaborate prank, or government experiment. True to form, Harper pissed off the tyrannical king with her refusal. Now she found herself at the mercy of convicts, locked away and forgotten in the bowels of a mountain. Harper’s gaze fell on a shadowy beast of a man, sitting casually on the rundown catwalk. The imposing man looked like he ruled the prison. He was the color of midnight, and his eyes were that eerie arctic blue, that was nearly colorless. Harper shivered as he regarded her. All Nameless knew was the Hold, with its misery and struggle. He never wanted to keep a female, surviving was hard enough, but that was before the Pink Pearl dropped into his world. Nameless had never seen anything like the stunning exotic little creature. Not only was she the catalyst for strange dreams and revelations about his past, but she made him feel. He had to have her. >Harper wanted free of the alien prison, and she wanted to go home, except Nameless wasn’t prepared or willing to let her go, even if she hated him because of it. He owned every part of her, and bound her to him, in ways that could never be undone, collar or no collar. In her wildest dreams, Harper never imagined the twists destiny could take, or that she would find soul deep satisfaction with such a nameless fate. Follow Harper and Nameless as they struggle to get free of the Hold, and seek their revenge on the despot responsible for putting them there.

Novelty teeth turn predatory. Flies settle and die on an old pair of sneakers in New York, and the Nevada desert swallows a Cadillac. Meanwhile the legend of Castle Rock returns... and grows on you. What does it all mean? What else could it mean?

There's something here for readers of every stripe and predilection - classic tales of the macabre and the monstrous, cutting-edge explorations of the borderlands between good and evil, brilliant pastiches of Chandler and Conan Doyle, even a teleplay and a non-fiction bonus, a heartfelt piece of Little League baseball that first appeared in The New Yorker.In story after story, several published here for the first time, he will take you to places you've never been before, places that are both dark and vividly illuminated.

Her job as a social worker in a British seaside town is more than a career: It’s the very essence of who she is. And though there are frustrations, Alex takes to heart the rewards of placing a child in a safe and loving home. But when she encounters three-year-old Ottilie Wade, Alex is completely unprepared for the effect the sweet, shy little girl has on her. Though on the surface Ottilie seems to want for nothing—she’s perfectly healthy and lives in a very nice home—she’s mysteriously silent and asocial. Alex knows that something is not right in the Wade house. And the deeper she looks into the case, the more Alex comes to feel that she and Ottilie are being drawn together by fate.   As disturbing evidence mounts and Alex’s superiors seem unwilling to help, Alex knows she will have to risk everything—her job and the life she loves—to save Ottilie.

Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Memoir', 'Pop Culture', 'Media Tie In', 'Adult']","Natalie Wood was always a star; her mother made sure this was true. A superstitious Russian immigrant who claimed to be royalty, Maria had been told by a gypsy, long before little Natasha Zakharenko's birth, that her second child would be famous throughout the world. When the beautiful child with the hypnotic eyes was first placed in Maria's arms, she knew the prophecy would become true and proceeded to do everything in her power — everything — to make sure of it.Natasha is the haunting story of a vulnerable and talented actress whom many of us felt we knew. We watched her mature on the movie screen before our eyes — in Miracle on 34th Street, Rebel Without a Cause, West Side Story, Splendor in the Grass, and on and on. She has been hailed — along with Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor — as one of the top three female movie stars in the history of film, making her a legend in her own lifetime and beyond. But the story of what Natalie endured, of what her life was like when the doors of the soundstages closed, has long been obscured.Natasha is based on years of exhaustive research into Natalie's turbulent life and mysterious drowning in the dark water that was her greatest fear. Author Suzanne Finstad, a former lawyer, conducted nearly four hundred interviews with Natalie's family, close friends, legendary costars, lovers, film crews, and virtually everyone connected with the investigation of her strange death. Through these firsthand accounts from many who have never spoken publicly before, Finstad has reconstructed a life of emotional abuse and exploitation, of almost unprecedented fame, great loneliness, poignancy, and loss. She sheds an unwavering light on Natalie's complex relationships with James Dean, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Raymond Burr, Warren Beatty, and Robert Wagner and reveals the two lost loves of Natalie's life, whom her controlling mother prevented her from marrying. Finstad tells this beauty's heartbreaking story with sensitivity and grace, revealing a complex and conflicting mix of fragility and strength in a woman who was swept along by forces few could have resisted. Natasha is impossible to put down — it is the definitive biography of Natalie Wood that we've long been waiting for.",,,06/12/01,April 9th 2002,['Natalie Wood'],Paperback,,9780609809570,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320434152l/333090.jpg,3.98,[],96.0,1.0,,,,94.0,2149.0,544,Three Rivers Press,"['718', '821', '487', '92', '31']",,[],,['Suzanne Finstad']

Set in the twenty-second century, the novel tells of a world where women are once again property, denied civil rights and banned from public life. Earth's wealth depends on interplanetary commerce with alien races, and linguists--a small, clannish group of families--have become the ruling elite by controlling all interplanetary communication. Their women are used to breed perfect translators for all the galaxies' languages.Nazareth Chornyak, the most talented linguist of the family, is exhausted by her constant work translating for trade organizations, supervising the children's language education, running the compound, and caring for the elderly men. She longs to retire to the Barren House, where women past childbearing age knit, chat, and wait to die.

Beginning with the study of DNA in Egyptian mummies in the early 1980s and culminating in the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010, Neanderthal Man describes the events, intrigues, failures, and triumphs of these scientifically rich years through the lens of the pioneer and inventor of the field of ancient DNA.We learn that Neanderthal genes offer a unique window into the lives of our hominin relatives and may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of why humans survived while Neanderthals went extinct. Drawing on genetic and fossil clues, Pääbo explores what is known about the origin of modern humans and their relationship to the Neanderthals and describes the fierce debate surrounding the nature of the two species’ interactions. His findings have not only redrawn our family tree, but recast the fundamentals of human history—the biological beginnings of fully modern Homo sapiens, the direct ancestors of all people alive today.A riveting story about a visionary researcher and the nature of scientific inquiry, Neanderthal Man offers rich insight into the fundamental question of who we are.",,,,February 11th 2014,[],Hardcover,,9780465020836,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386384555l/19243883.jpg,4.06,[],97.0,1.0,,,,94.0,2361.0,288,Basic Books,"['886', '913', '422', '100', '40']",,[],,['Svante Pääbo']

Never Play Dead: How the Truth Makes You Unstoppable,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir']","The Fox Nation host, Fox News contributor, and social media master argues that it’s time to square your shoulders, stand your ground and speak the truth.The conventional wisdom is that we need more civility and fewer arguments. If you have a controversial option, keep it to yourself. Tomi Lahren could not disagree more. It’s a trick. The same people whining about tone will call you names and applaud those who threaten you. We don’t need safe spaces, and you shouldn’t be patient and wait out the bullying. In Never Play Dead, Lahren encourages all Americans, especially women, to find their voice and speak out. She skewers the hypocrisy of the self-esteem movement that has made people afraid to stand up for themselves. Wherever Lahren goes, the # 1 question she gets isn’t about politics. It’s about her confidence in herself, her beliefs and who she is. Never Play Dead not only answers this question but helps you learn how to stand your ground, discover how resilient you are and find your fearless side. In this book, she offers the antidote to all that: worry less about who might offend, and focus on who you might inspire. In the long-run, you will never regret being forceful when the truth is on your side.Lahren worked her way out of South Dakota to television fame in LA, surviving social isolation, a truly terrible boyfriend, awful workplaces, and getting fired in front of a million haters. Along the way, she was tempted to keep quiet, but she never did. Now she calls out the comment trolls, the political correctness police, the terminally jealous, and the ever-escalation victim culture that tells you all your failures are because of the system (and therefore there’s nothing you can do about it). Whether you’ve been told you’re not good enough by parents, lovers, frenemies, bad bosses, or social media, it’s time to take Lahren’s advice and fight back. It’s better to lose friends and followers than to lose yourself. The truth is, you may find more people who agree with you than you think. It’s time to shed your fear. With Never Play Dead she inspires you to stand up—and shows you how.",,,,July 2nd 2019,[],Hardcover,,9780062881946,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1554473367l/43386663._SY475_.jpg,3.59,[],29.0,1.0,,,,79.0,380.0,256,Broadside Books,"['130', '103', '67', '22', '58']",,[],,['Tomi Lahren']

It fed tasty crackers to all the hungry parrots in my mental aviary."" —TOM ROBBINSJoin cult favorite Tony Vigorito in his acclaimed, surreal whirlwind of a novel exploring chaos theory. A prisoner spins a playing card into a somersault, stirring a wind that becomes a tornado that takes off the roof of a church in nearby Normal, Illinois. Elizabeth Wildhack is born in that church and someday she will meet that prisoner, a man named Diablo, on the streets of New Orleans—where a hurricane-like Great White Spot hovers off the coast. But how is it all interconnected? And what does it have to do with a time-traveling serf and a secret society whose motto is “Walk away?”""Linguistic gymnastics abound… Vigorito demonstrates once again that he's a wild stylist… startlingly original… an entertaining anarchist…"" —The Chicago Sun-Times""Chaos theory says that a tiny, almost imperceptible event can have large, even catastrophic coincidences: a butterfly flapping its wings in North America leads to a hurricane on another continent, for example. In this fictional take on chaos theory, several offbeat characters are linked by a single event that expands through time, sweeping them up in it and changing their lives. A traveler works a nifty trick with a playing card, and a tornado strikes a small Illinois town; a woman is born during the tornado and later meets the man who set it in motion; 1,200 years earlier, a man who is supposed to be stoned to death discovers he has an uncanny knack for surviving; and, back in the present day, another man speaks only in the present tense. Comparisons of this novel to the works of Tom Robbins are both obvious and appropriate: the story meanders around in an entertaining manner, never getting too serious about itself; the characters are splendidly loopy, close to caricature but never quite reaching it, and the situations in which they find themselves are comic, dramatic, and everything in between."" —Booklist",,,,October 6th 2008,[],Paperback,,9780156031233,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442776655l/3288140._SY475_.jpg,3.74,[],100.0,1.0,,,,84.0,894.0,416,Mariner Books,"['285', '270', '200', '101', '38']",,[],,['Tony Vigorito']

Notebooks of the Mind,Explorations of Thinking,Psychology,"How do creative people think? Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of ""experienced thinkers""--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin's preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous ""bag of memories"" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.",,,,1997.0,,,0195108965,9780195108965,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uj1RDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.81,,,,,,,,,288.0,,,17.0,,,['Vera John-Steiner']

Notes of a Pug-Nosed Mephistopheles,,"['Classics', 'Fiction']","Notes of a Pug-Nosed Mephistopheles (Zapysky kyrpatoho Mefistofelia), a novel first published in 1917, provides some good examples of Vynnychenko's views on sexual morality. Preserving virginity is a “violation of the laws of nature” (p.105); morality is “the pink cosmetic powder over the laws of nature” (p.121); and honesty is a concept “invented by human hypocrisy, stupidity and by the imperfect social structure” (p.123). The novel deals with the problem of unwanted children that complicate the lives of sexual partners and an attempted infanticide. Uncertainty about paternity is one of Vynnychenko’s preoccupations; once it is firmly established, paternity becomes a force that can overcome his commitment to free love and replace it with moral obligations.

Never Die Easy: The Autobiography of Walter Payton,,"['Sports', 'Biography', 'Football', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Leadership']","""Never die easy. Why run out of bounds and die easy? Make that linebacker pay. It carries into all facets of your life. It's okay to lose, to die, but don't die without trying, without giving it your best."" His legacy is towering. Walter Payton—the man they called Sweetness, for the way he ran—remains the most prolific running back in the history of the National Football League, the star of the Chicago Bears' only Super Bowl Championship, eleven times voted the most popular sports figure in Chicago's history. Off the field, he was a devoted father whose charitable foundation benefited tens of thousands of children each year, and who—faced with terminal liver disease—refused to use his celebrity to gain a preferential position for organ donation. Walter Payton was not just a football hero; he was America's hero.        Never Die Easy is Walter Payton's autobiography, told from the heart. Growing up poor in Mississippi, he took up football to get girls' attention, and went on to become a Black College All-American at tiny Jackson State (during which time he was also a finalist in a Soul Train dance contest). Drafted by the Bears in 1975, he predicted that he would last only five years but went on to play thirteen extraordinary seasons, a career earning him regular acknowledgment as one of the greatest players in the history of professional football. And when his playing days were over, he approached business and charity endeavors with the same determination and success he had brought to the football field, always putting first his devotion to friends and family. His ultimate battle with illness truly proved him the champion he always had been and prompted a staggering outpouring of love and support from hundreds of thousands of friends and admirers.        Written with veteran journalist and author Don Yaeger in the last weeks of Walter Payton's life, Never Die Easy presents Walter's singular voice—warm, plainspoken, funny, self-aware—along with the voices of the friends, family, teammates, and business associates who knew him best at all stages of his life, including his wife, Connie, and their children, Brittney and Jarrett; his teammate and friend Matt Suhey; former Bears head coach Mike Ditka; and many, many others.          Walter made Don Yaeger promise that his book would be ""inspirational and leave people with some kind of lesson . . . and make sure you spell all the words right."" Never Die Easy keeps all those promises.",,,01/01/00,September 11th 2001,[],Paperback,,9780375758218,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403185648l/6837.jpg,4.21,[],162.0,2.0,,,,95.0,1290.0,288,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['609', '423', '197', '44', '17']",,[],,"['Walter Payton', 'Don Yaeger']"

Autour de ce drame intime et cruel, l'auteur des Bâtards du soleil et d'Ayez pitié du cœur des hommes (prix des Libraires 1992) brosse une fresque somptueuse, parsemée de dialogues étincelants, où revit dans sa vérité une des époques les plus fascinantes de notre histoire.",,,11/05/96,August 22nd 1996,[],Paperback,,9782226084750,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1587958118l/3772126._SY475_.jpg,4.11,['Prix des Deux-Magots (1997)'],95.0,1.0,,,,100.0,9.0,336,Albin Michel,"['4', '2', '3', '0', '0']",,[],,['Ève de Castro']

Doch das macht nichts, denn sie hat etwas anderes ... Nana, das Kind aus der Gosse, Tochter einer Wäscherin, ausgestattet mit großen sinnlichen Reizen, steigt auf zur begehrtesten Kurtisane der Pariser Gesellschaft. Sie wird zum Idol, dem sich die Männer zu Füßen werfen. Bankiers bringen ihr ein ganzes Vermögen zum Opfer, Aristokraten ihre Würde, Jünglinge nehmen sich ihretwegen das Leben.
