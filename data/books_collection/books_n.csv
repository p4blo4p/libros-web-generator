N. Kasturi,Loving God,,English,,"This is the biography of Professor N. Kasturi, the chosen biographer of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. This book is his autobiography, his story, his journey to the feet of the Lord, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.  In his own words, ""Each of us has to live the volume of biography, which we bring with us, as often as we are born, page after page, chapter after chapter, howsoever punctuated with dots and dashes, interrogations and exclamations, commas and colons, until the sentence ends ultimately with a Full Stop. But, luckily, I have as my inseparable companion and counsel, Bhagawan Himself; He dots the i’s and crosses the t’s as I live the lines on every page. He has made the Book of Life, my biography – momentous and meaningful for me. I must, however, confess that I do not deserve this book on me, by me. There are, I know, millions, who are absorbing the Love of the Living Loving God much deeper, who can, therefore, stand forth as messengers of His Love. They can lead the unloved and the unloving with surer and firmer steps, to the Presence of the Redeemer, the Comforter, the Saviour, the Avatar, the Sai. Nevertheless, when Bhagawan manifested a faint, favourable interest, when someone ventured to whisper to me in His Presence, that a bunch of my reminiscences may be welcomed by many, I was promoted by that smile to embark on this audacious adventure. My memory assumed the role of Chief Editor and hence, the chronicle suffers from imperfect chronology. Since the four parts of 'Sathyam Sivam Sundram' relate most of that I have yearned to communicate, this book has become a personal testament, often perhaps too personal to be tolerated, for which act of indiscretion, I ask for pardon.  Flattery is the food of fools, say those, who are denied that pabulum. I dare not deny my taste, for I have been fooled by flatterers, who threw appellations like poet, scholar, linguist, humourist, philosopher, and even ant-hill sage! Please dear reader, remember that I am struggling my best to eliminate the poison of the ego and sympathise with me, whenever you find the reptile raising its hood between the lines of this book. A few ‘old students’ of my classes at the University, my grandson, his wife, and a few brothers at Prasanthi Nilayam demanded that I should not give up the work and insisted on the completion of the book. As a result, this book, ‘Loving God’ is now placed at the Feet of the Lord and on the palms of those, who live in the Love of the Lord.

James and Jeffrey Birmingham, brothers, now find themselves and their families on opposing sides of a great and terrible conflict.James is a wealthy Bostonian with a son who is a passionate and outspoken abolitionist, and a daughter who must hide her identity as the writer of controversial newspaper articles.Jeffrey, who lives on a South Carolina plantation, has a son who joins the Mormon Church, then leaves home after a failed attempt to free his family's slaves. Jeffrey's cowardly younger son ruthlessly preys on the weak; and his young daughter despises her family's beliefs — finding more kinship with the slaves than with her own flesh and blood.Caught in the middle are the slaves, who, along with immigrant families, are desperate to find their place in a country that is rapidly drawing its battle lines.

When Nate Wilson looks at the world around him, he asks ""What is this place? Why is this place? Who approved it? Am I supposed to take it seriously?"" What could such an outlandish, fantastical world say about its Creator?  In these sparkling chapters, Wilson gives an aesthetic examination of the ways in which humanity has tried to make sense of this overwhelming carnival ride of a world. He takes a whimsical, thought-provoking look at everything from the ""magic"" of quantum physics, to nature's absurdities, to the problem of evil, evolution and hell.

N.T. Wright,Simply Christian: Why Christianity Makes Sense,,English,,"Why do we expect justice? Why do we crave spirituality? Why are we attracted to beauty? Why are relationships often so painful? And how will the world be made right? These are not simply perennial questions all generations must struggle with, but, according to N. T. Wright, are the very echoes of a voice we dimly perceive but deeply long to hear. In fact, these questions take us to the heart of who God is and what He wants from us.For two thousand years, Christianity has claimed to solve these mysteries, and this renowned biblical scholar and Anglican bishop shows that it still can today. Not since C. S. Lewis's classic summary of the faith, Mere Christianity, has such a wise and thorough scholar taken the time to explain to anyone who wants to know what Christianity really is and how it is practiced. Wright makes the case for Christian faith from the ground up, assuming that the reader has no knowledge of (and perhaps even some aversion to) religion in general and Christianity in particular.Simply Christian walks the reader through the Christian faith step by step and question by question. With simple yet exciting and accessible prose, Wright challenges skeptics by offering explanations for even the toughest doubt-filled dilemmas, leaving believers with a reason for renewed faith. For anyone who wants to travel beyond the controversies that can obscure what the Christian faith really stands for, this simple book is the perfect vehicle for that journey.",,,01/01/06,March 14th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Living', 'Church', 'Christian Non Fiction']",,9780060507152,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924444l/69094.jpg,4.07,[],158.0,2.0,,69094.Simply_Christian,,,,,94.0,8726.0,237,,HarperOne,"['3402', '3242', '1569', '346', '167']",,,[],,

We do not “go to” heaven; we are resurrected and heaven comes down to earth--a difference that makes all of the difference to how we live on earth. Following N.T. Wright’s resonant exploration of a life of faith in Simply Christian, the award-winning author whom Newsweek calls “the world’s leading New Testament scholar” takes on one of life’s most controversial topics, a matter of life, death, spirituality, and survival for everyone living in the world today. ",,,05/30/07,February 5th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Living', 'Church', 'Christian Non Fiction']",,9780061551826,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347624226l/2319645.jpg,4.33,[],265.0,3.0,,2319645.Surprised_by_Hope,,,,,97.0,11160.0,332,,HarperOne,"['5838', '3670', '1285', '248', '119']",,,[],,
N.T. Wright,The Resurrection of the Son of God,,English,,"Why did Christianity begin, and why did it take the shape it did? To answer this question – which any historian must face – renowned New Testament scholar N.T. Wright focuses on the key points: what precisely happened at Easter? What did the early Christians mean when they said that Jesus of Nazareth had been raised from the dead? What can be said today about his belief? This book, third in Wright’s series Christian Origins and the Question of God, sketches a map of ancient beliefs about life after death, in both the Greco-Roman and Jewish worlds. It then highlights the fact that the early Christians’ belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions. This, together with other features of early Christianity, forces the historian to read the Easter narratives in the gospels, not simply as late rationalizations of early Christian spirituality, but as accounts of two actual events: the empty tomb of Jesus and his ""appearances."" How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians’ answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead; that was why they hailed him as the messianic ""son of God."" No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation.

This book is extraordinarily ambitious and rigor, aiming to reorient the reader’s understanding of the history of economics. Further, the readers will be confronted by awakening economic lessons in today’s modern life. It is monumental and influential especially with regard to making an economic analysis.Written by a renowned French economist, Thomas Piketty, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is one of the most important books of the year, if not of the decade. It compares history and its relevance in the modern day society. Impossible to ignore, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is available online with free shipping options.

Regularly priced at $4.99. Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device.Simon Sinek’s book explains what it is that those apparently born leaders do that makes them so successful. He explains how leaders are not necessarily born; that they can be made. Sinek reveals how any of us can learn what the world’s “born” leaders do that most people don’t. This is a “must read” book for anyone who wants to lead their organization to success.What is the great secret that puts one person or organization way out in front of the rest? How do they get to be so much more innovative and successful and remain so, whatever their competitors do? Well, the answer is that asking questions is a good start but they have to be the right questions. Sinek tells us that the most vital question is “WHY.”In business, it is obviously a good idea to know what you do. You need to know how you do it. But most important of all is to know WHY you do what you do. In “Start with Why,” the author explains that it’s the basic question all the great leaders in business, social reform, or any other field asked themselves right at the beginning. He examines such leaders as Steve Jobs, Richard Branson or Martin Luther King and notes that they all applied the same thinking and started from the same question:”WHY?”The book goes on to show us how to apply this principle in our own businesses. It explains how to get from “what?” to “how?” and on to “WHY?” Why are we doing what we do rather than something else? Read the book, apply its lessons and you could be the next Jobs or Branson. The sky’s no longer the limit!

Today only, get this Amazon bestseller for just $2.99. Regularly priced at $4.99. Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device.  Daniel Kahneman, psychologist and Nobel Prize winner, is the author of the fascinating book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” In general, when we make decisions, be it personally or professionally, all of us utilize two basic thinking systems for problem solving, and the importance of utilizing the right system. This book is all about two basic thinking systems. The first system is Fast Thinking and the second system is Slow Thinking.  In short, Fast Thinking is what our “gut” tells us what we should do. It is intuitive, emotional, and done with little thought or effort. Slow thinking is slow, deliberate, and logical. It usually takes more time, often includes numerical or factual information that our brain needs to process and is void of emotion. Kahneman expresses the importance of making it a habit to train our brains into using the right way of “thinking” as we make decisions, as utilizing the wrong thinking system can lead to poor or even disastrous consequences.  Kahneman, through intensive behavioral study, has determined that people are more successful if they can lean on the Slow Thinking method. Kahneman teaches his proven theory simply, and includes a plan of action for learning to train the brain to use the correct “thinking” system. This novel takes a fascinating look at behaviors that can change our lives - personally, professionally, and financially. It is a book you should read to improve and utilize your thinking system the right way.

It provides organization systems, which incorporate roles and goals that will help with long term planning. Restating the importance of organization, Getting Things Done also plays with prioritization, which will help to sort which tasks to do first. Organization is the key to everything, and this is especially adopted in the Western notion that once you get really organized, you will be able to be productive for 24 hours a day.  Written by David Allen, a management consultant and executive coach, Getting Things Done really elaborates on how to attain maximum efficiency but still be able to relax later whenever the readers want to. The readers will learn to focus their energies strategically and tactically through a workflow management plan. The workflow management plan has to fulfill two criteria: it must be doable and dependable, but it must also discipline the person who is doing it to be able to make front-end decisions featured with action plans for all the generated inputs into that system. All in all, the readers will learn to do tasks quickly, to delegate tasks appropriately or to defer tasks altogether.  Without having to spend too much time, you can learn the tips and tricks taught in Getting Things Done to create a better work habit and workflow at your office or even in your home. Gain much more control in your life, especially if you are overwhelmed with too many things to do in so little time. Learn that every task, promise, and assignment has its own place and time.

Nadia Hashimi (Goodreads Author),The Pearl That Broke Its Shell,,English,,"Afghan-American Nadia Hashimi's literary debut novel, The Pearl that Broke Its Shell is a searing tale of powerlessness, fate, and the freedom to control one's own fate that combines the cultural flavor and emotional resonance of the works of Khaled Hosseini, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Lisa See.In Kabul, 2007, with a drug-addicted father and no brothers, Rahima and her sisters can only sporadically attend school, and can rarely leave the house. Their only hope lies in the ancient custom of bacha posh, which allows young Rahima to dress and be treated as a boy until she is of marriageable age. As a son, she can attend school, go to the market, and chaperone her older sisters.But Rahima is not the first in her family to adopt this unusual custom.

Nadia Hashimi (Goodreads Author),A House Without Windows,,English,,"A vivid, unforgettable story of an unlikely sisterhood—an emotionally powerful and haunting story of friendship that illuminates the plight of women in a traditional culture, from the author of the bestselling The Pearl That Broke Its Shell and When the Moon Is Low.For two decades, Zeba was a loving wife, a patient mother, and a peaceful villager. But her quiet life is shattered when her husband, Kamal, is found brutally murdered with a hatchet in the courtyard of their home. Nearly catatonic with shock, Zeba is unable to account for her whereabouts at the time of his death. Her children swear their mother could not have committed such a heinous act. Kamal’s family is sure she did, and demands justice. Barely escaping a vengeful mob, Zeba is arrested and jailed.Awaiting trial, she meets a group of women whose own misfortunes have led them to these bleak cells: eighteen-year-old Nafisa, imprisoned to protect her from an “honor killing”; twenty-five-year-old Latifa, a teen runaway who stays because it is safe shelter; twenty-year-old Mezghan, pregnant and unmarried, waiting for a court order to force her lover’s hand. Is Zeba a cold-blooded killer, these young women wonder, or has she been imprisoned, like them, for breaking some social rule? For these women, the prison is both a haven and a punishment; removed from the harsh and unforgiving world outside, they form a lively and indelible sisterhood.Into this closed world comes Yusuf, Zeba’s Afghan-born, American-raised lawyer whose commitment to human rights and desire to help his homeland have brought him back. With the fate this seemingly ordinary housewife in his hands, Yusuf discovers that, like the Afghanistan itself, his client may not be at all what he imagines.A moving look at the lives of modern Afghan women, The House with No Windows is astonishing, frightening, and triumphant.",,,08/15/16,August 16th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Cultural', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Mystery']",,9780062449689,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1450648776l/27213250.jpg,3.98,[],67.0,1.0,,27213250-a-house-without-windows,,,,,95.0,9275.0,415,,William Morrow,"['2720', '4229', '1870', '376', '80']",,,[],,
"Nadia Idle (Editor), Alex Nunns (Editor)",Tweets from Tahrir,,English,,"Egypt’s revolution as it unfolded, in the words of the people who made it.The Twitter accounts of the activists who brought heady days of revolution to Egypt in January and February this year paint an exhilarating picture of an uprising in real-time. Thousands of young people documented on cell phones every stage of their revolution, as it happened. This book brings together a selection of key tweets in a compelling, fast-paced narrative, allowing the story of the uprising to be told directly by the people in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.Many of the activists were “citizen journalists”, using Twitter to report what was happening. Others used the social network to organize, communicating the next steps necessary for the revolution to move forward. Nearly everyone online gave instant reactions to the extraordinary events occurring before their eyes. History has never before been written in this fashion. The tweet limit of 140 characters evidently concentrated the feelings of those using Twitter. Raw emotion bursts from their messages, whether frantic alarm at attacks from pro-government thugs or delirious happiness at the fall of the dictator. To read these tweets is to embark a rollercoaster ride, from the surprise and excitement of the first demonstration, to the horror of the violence that claimed hundreds of lives, to the final ecstasy of victory.Many of those tweeting also took photographs with their phones and these illustrate the book, providing remarkable snapshots from the heart of the action.Edited by young activists Alex Nunns and Nadia Idle, an Egyptian who was in Tahrir Square when Mubarak fell, Tweets from Tahrir is a highly original take on one of the most important and dramatic events in recent world politics.

ISIS kareiviai žudė vyrus, kurie nesutiko atsiversti į islamą, ir moteris, kurios buvo per senos tapti sekso vergėmis. Nadios motiną ir šešis brolius taip pat nužudė, o ji pati buvo išvežta į Mosulą ir, kaip ir tūkstančiai kitų jazidų moterų, parduota į „Islamo valstybės"" sekso vergiją. Mergina buvo laikoma nelaisvėje, mušama ir prievartaujama, tačiau galiausiai jai pavyko pabėgti ir išsigelbėti.Nadia nė neįsivaizdavo, kad vieną dieną ji taps žmogaus teisių aktyviste. Ji metė iššūkį visoms etiketėms, kurias jai mėgino klijuoti gyvenimas: našlaitės, prievartos aukos, vergės, pabėgėlės. Vietoje jų ji susikūrė naujas: likusi gyva, jazidų lyderė, moterų užtarėja, Nobelio taikos premijos nominantė, Jungtinių Tautų geros valios ambasadorė, o dabar ir knygos autorė.Nadia ne tik sugebėjo išreikšti savo nuomonę, ji taip pat kalba už kiekvieną jazidą, nukentėjusį nuo genocido, vykdomo Irake, už kiekvieną prievartautą moterį ir už kiekvieną likimo valiai paliktą pabėgėlį. Ši knyga – tai didžiulio žmogaus noro gyventi liudijimas ir meilės laiškas – prarastai šaliai, trapiai bendruomenei ir karo išblaškytai šeimai.„Drąsus Nadios Murad liudijimas yra šiurpus, tačiau labai reikalingas ir svarbus skaitinys...

Naguib Mahfouz,The Cairo Trilogy: Palace Walk / Palace of Desire / Sugar Street,,English,,"Naguib Mahfouz’s magnificent epic trilogy of colonial Egypt appears here in one volume for the first time. The Nobel Prize-winning writer's masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain's occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century.The novels of The Cairo Trilogy trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. Sugar Street brings Mahfouz’s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries.

Rich with irony and infused with political undertones, the story is narrated alternately by the pious and mischievous family patriarch Muhtashimi Zayed, his hapless grandson Elwan, and Elwan's headstrong and beautiful fiancee Randa.  The novel reaches its climax with the assassination of Sadat on October 6, 1981, an event around which the fictional plot is skillfully woven.

Sumber segala pencerahan kehidupan’. Membaca buku ini, saya bukan hanya diajak berkeliling Turki, tetapi lebih dari itu, saya juga bisa merasakan kekuatan berlimpahnya cinta dan kedamaian spiritual yang tampak dan muncul dari tokoh-tokoh yang hadir dalam buku ini...Rasanya saya ingin segera mendatangi tempat-tempat yang sudah ditunjuk oleh Najiyah, dan merasakan apa yang dikatakan Rumi tentang pencerahan rohani 800 tahun lalu”.Budhy Munawar RachmanPendiri Nurcholish Madjid SocietyNajmar menawarkan pendekatan segar dalam mengulas berbagai gagasan sufisme Jalaluddin Rumi: berangkat dari pengalaman pribadi dari hari ke hari saat dia napak tilas peninggalan Rumi di Turki, naratif, berbahasa populer, dan terkadang jenaka. Siapa pun bakal dipermudah untuk turut menyimak catatan perjalanan spiritual ini secara santai, renyah, tanpa merasa dicekoki konsep-konsep njelimet, tetapi sekaligus tetap mengena—bahkan pada beberapa momen malah cukup menggugah.

It is a beacon of hope held together by many hands: Old enemies. New allies. Wary loners.But a century of distrust and suspicion can’t be so easily forgotten and threatens to shatter Trinity from within at any moment.

Nancy Bevilaqua (Goodreads Author),Holding Breath: A Memoir of AIDS' Wildfire Days,,English,,"When they met, David was a 41-year-old heroin addict, homeless and dying of AIDS. The author was a 27-year-old, self-absorbed, bar-hopping would-be poet--and his caseworker. In 1989, in New York City, there was nothing ""manageable"" about AIDS, and David would have only eight more months to live. Something about him drew her to him until the boundary between ""caseworker"" and ""client"" dissolved, and she fell in love with him. Living together in secrecy in his little Lower East Side studio for those final eight months, they hoped for the impossible until it was impossible to hope any more. In the short time they had together--a time that would change them both--they formed a relationship that would, sixteen years later, unexpectedly and with ferocity come back to haunt the author, send her into the full-fledged grief that she had denied herself when David died, and change her life once again.Available at:http://www.amazon.com/Holding-Breath-...",,,10/19/12,October 21st 2012,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']",,9781480164512,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366299112l/16110861.jpg,3.65,[],100.0,1.0,,16110861-holding-breath,,,,,75.0,85.0,240,,CreateSpace Independent Publishing,"['28', '23', '13', '18', '3']",,,[],,

"Nancy Forbes, Basil Mahon","Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field: How Two Men Revolutionized Physics",,,,"The story of two brilliant nineteenth-century scientists who discovered the electromagnetic field, laying the groundwork for the amazing technological and theoretical breakthroughs of the twentieth century.Two of the boldest and most creative scientists of all time were Michael Faraday (1791-1867) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879). This is the story of how these two men - separated in age by forty years - discovered the existence of the electromagnetic field and devised a radically new theory which overturned the strictly mechanical view of the world that had prevailed since Newton's time.The authors, veteran science writers with special expertise in physics and engineering, have created a lively narrative that interweaves rich biographical detail from each man's life with clear explanations of their scientific accomplishments. Faraday was an autodidact, who overcame class prejudice and a lack of mathematical training to become renowned for his acute powers of experimental observation, technological skills, and prodigious scientific imagination. James Clerk Maxwell was highly regarded as one of the most brilliant mathematical physicists of the age. He made an enormous number of advances in his own right. But when he translated Faraday's ideas into mathematical language, thus creating field theory, this unified framework of electricity, magnetism and light became the basis for much of later, 20th-century physics.Faraday's and Maxwell's collaborative efforts gave rise to many of the technological innovations we take for granted today - from electric power generation to television, and much more. Told with panache, warmth, and clarity, this captivating story of their greatest work - in which each played an equal part - and their inspiring lives will bring new appreciation to these giants of science.",,,01/01/14,March 11th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'History', 'Biography', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'History Of Science', 'Technology', 'Biography Memoir', 'Popular Science']",,9781616149420,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390172532l/18240286.jpg,4.25,[],88.0,1.0,,18240286-faraday-maxwell-and-the-electromagnetic-field,,,,,97.0,1018.0,320,,Prometheus Books,"['459', '390', '137', '24', '8']",,,[],,

Nancy Horan,Loving Frank,,English,,"I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives. In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America’s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney’s profound influence on Wright. Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan’s Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world. Mamah’s is an unforgettable journey marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leading inexorably ultimately lead to this novel’s stunning conclusion. Elegantly written and remarkably rich in detail, Loving Frank is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman, a national icon, and their timeless love story.",,,,August 7th 2007,"['Frank Lloyd Wright', 'Mamah Borthwick Cheney']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Historical', 'Architecture', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Art', 'Audiobook']",,9780345494993,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441383192l/898885._SY475_.jpg,3.76,['James Fenimore Cooper Prize (2009)'],1097.0,17.0,,898885.Loving_Frank,,,,,90.0,89905.0,384,,Ballantine Books,"['21471', '36241', '23342', '6790', '2061']",,,['United States of America'],,

Not long after her arrival, however, tragedy strikes, and Fanny and her brood repair to a quiet artists' colony in France where she can recuperate. There she meets Robert Louis Stevenson, ten years her junior, who is instantly smitten with the earthy, independent and opinionated belle Americaine.A woman ahead of her time, Fanny does not immediately take to the young lawyer who longs to devote his life to literature, and who would eventually write such classics as Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In time, though, she succumbs to Stevenson's charms. The two begin a fierce love affair, marked by intense joy and harrowing darkness, which spans decades as they travel the world for the sake of his health. Eventually they settled in Samoa, where Robert Louis Stevenson is buried underneath the epitaph:

Nancy Huston,Fault Lines,,English,,"A best seller in France, with over 400,000 copies sold, and currently being translated into eighteen languages, Fault Lines is the new novel from internationally-acclaimed and best-selling author Nancy Huston. Huston's novel is a profound and poetic story that traces four generations of a single family from present-day California to WW II era Germany. Fault Lines begins with Sol, a gifted, terrifying child whose mother believes he is destined for greatness partly because he has a birthmark like his dad, his grandmother, and his great-grandmother. When Sol's family makes an unexpected trip to Germany, secrets begin to emerge about their history during World War II. It seems birthmarks are not all that's been passed down through the bloodlines. Closely observed, lyrically told, and epic in scope, Fault Lines is a touching, fearless, and unusual novel about four generations of children and their parents. The story moves from the West Coast of the United States to the East, from Haifa to Toronto to Munich, as secrets unwind back through time until a devastating truth about the family's origins is reached.

Years pass, and Guinevere becomes a great beauty, riding free across Northern Wales on her beloved horse. She is entranced by the tales of the valorous Arthur, a courageous warrior who seems to Guinevere no mere man, but a legend. Then she finds herself betrothed to that same famous king, a hero who commands her willing devotion. Just as his knights and all his subjects, she falls under Arthur’s spell. At the side of King Arthur, Guinevere reigns strong and true. Yet she soon learns how the dark prophecy will reveal itself. She is unable to conceive. Arthur’s only true heir is Mordred, offspring of a cursed encounter with the witch Morgause. Now Guinevere must make a fateful choice: She decides to raise Mordred, teaching him to be a ruler and to honor Camelot. She will love him like a mother. Mordred will be her greatest joy–and the key to her ultimate downfall.

Nancy Pickard,The Virgin of Small Plains,,English,,"Small Plains, Kansas, January 23, 1987: In the midst of a deadly blizzard, eighteen-year-old Rex Shellenberger scours his father’s pasture, looking for helpless newborn calves. Then he makes a shocking discovery: the naked, frozen body of a teenage girl, her skin as white as the snow around her. Even dead, she is the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen. It is a moment that will forever change his life and the lives of everyone around him. The mysterious dead girl–the “Virgin of Small Plains”–inspires local reverence. In the two decades following her death, strange miracles visit those who faithfully tend to her grave; some even believe that her spirit can cure deadly illnesses. Slowly, word of the legend spreads.But what really happened in that snow-covered field? Why did young Mitch Newquist disappear the day after the Virgin’s body was found, leaving behind his distraught girlfriend, Abby Reynolds? Why do the town’s three most powerful men–Dr. Quentin Reynolds, former sheriff Nathan Shellenberger, and Judge, Tom Newquist–all seem to be hiding the details of that night? Seventeen years later, when Mitch suddenly returns to Small Plains, simmering tensions come to a head, ghosts that had long slumbered whisper anew, and the secrets that some wish would stay buried rise again from the grave of the Virgin. Abby–never having resolved her feelings for Mitch–is now determined to uncover exactly what happened so many years ago to tear their lives apart. Three families and three friends, their worlds inexorably altered in the course of one night, must confront the ever-unfolding consequences in award-winning author Nancy Pickard’s remarkable novel of suspense.

Nancy Pickard,The Scent of Rain and Lightning,,English,,"Engrossing, lyrical, and suspenseful, The Scent of Rain and Lightning captures the essence of small-town America—its heartfelt intimacy and its darkest secrets—where through struggle and hardship people still dare to hope for a better future. For Jody Linder, maybe even love.One beautiful summer afternoon, from her bedroom window on the second floor, Jody Linder is unnerved to see her three uncles parking their pickups in front of her parents’ house—or what she calls her parents’ house, even though Jay and Laurie Jo Linder have been gone almost all of Jody’s life. “What is this fearsome thing I see?” the young high school English teacher whispers, mimicking Shakespeare. Polished boots, pressed jeans, fresh white shirts, Stetsons—her uncles’ suspiciously clean visiting clothes are a disturbing sign. The three bring shocking news: The man convicted of murdering Jody’s father is being released from prison and returning to the small town of Rose, Kansas. It has been twenty-six years since that stormy night when, as baby Jody lay asleep in her crib, her father was shot and killed and her mother disappeared, presumed dead. Neither the protective embrace of Jody’s uncles nor the safe haven of her grandparents’ ranch could erase the pain caused by Billy Crosby on that catastrophic night. Now Billy Crosby has been granted a new trial, thanks in large part to the efforts of his son, Collin, a lawyer who has spent most of his life trying to prove his father’s innocence. As Jody lives only a few doors down from the Crosbys, she knows that sooner or later she’ll come face-to-face with the man who she believes destroyed her family. What she doesn’t expect are the heated exchanges with Collin. Having grown up practically side by side in this very small town, Jody and Collin have had a long history of carefully avoiding each other’s eyes. Now Jody discovers that underneath their antagonism is a shared sense of loss that no one else could possibly understand. As she revisits old wounds, startling revelations compel her to uncover the dangerous truth about her family’s tragic past.

"Nando Parrado, Vince Rause",Miracle in the Andes,,English,,"In the first hours there was nothing, no fear or sadness, just a black and perfect silence.Nando Parrado was unconscious for three days before he woke to discover that the plane carrying his rugby team, as well as their family members and supporters, to an exhibition game in Chile had crashed somewhere deep in the Andes. He soon learned that many were dead or dying—among them his own mother and sister. Those who remained were stranded on a lifeless glacier at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level, with no supplies and no means of summoning help. They struggled to endure freezing temperatures, deadly avalanches, and then the devastating news that the search for them had been called off.As time passed and Nando's thoughts turned increasingly to his father, who he knew must be consumed with grief, Nando resolved that he must get home or die trying. He would challenge the Andes, even though he was certain the effort would kill him, telling himself that even if he failed he would die that much closer to his father. It was a desperate decision, but it was also his only chance. So Nando, an ordinary young man with no disposition for leadership or heroism, led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snow-capped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to find help.Thirty years after the disaster Nando tells his story with remarkable candor and depth of feeling. Miracle in the Andes—a first person account of the crash and its aftermath—is more than a riveting tale of true-life adventure: it is a revealing look at life at the edge of death and a meditation on the limitless redemptive power of love.",,,10/30/06,May 15th 2007,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Survival', 'Adventure', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Travel', 'Biography Memoir', 'True Story']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320544978l/454236.jpg,4.26,[],97.0,1.0,,454236.Miracle_in_the_Andes,,,,,97.0,16189.0,304,,Broadway Books,"['7519', '5955', '2307', '297', '111']",,,[],,

Parents and family members who never thought they could get inside the head of their autistic loved one, at last, have a way to break through to the curious, subtle, and complex life within.Using an alphabet grid to painstakingly construct words, sentences, and thoughts that he is unable to speak out loud, Naoki answers even the most delicate questions that people want to know. Questions such as: “Why do people with autism talk so loudly and weirdly?” “Why do you line up your toy cars and blocks?” “Why don’t you make eye contact when you’re talking?” and “What’s the reason you jump?” (Naoki’s answer: “When I’m jumping, it’s as if my feelings are going upward to the sky.”) With disarming honesty and a generous heart, Naoki shares his unique point of view on not only autism but life itself. His insights—into the mystery of words, the wonders of laughter, and the elusiveness of memory—are so startling, so strange, and so powerful that you will never look at the world the same way again.",,,10/28/05,August 27th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Psychology', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Japan', 'Autobiography', 'Mental Health', 'Education', 'Japanese Literature']",,9780812994865,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384018847l/16113737.jpg,3.82,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2013)'],392.0,4.0,,16113737-the-reason-i-jump,,,,,90.0,42665.0,135,,Random House,"['12535', '15186', '10776', '3053', '1115']",,,[],,

Naomi Klein,No Logo,,English,,"With a new Afterword to the 2002 edition, No Logo employs journalistic savvy and personal testament to detail the insidious practices and far-reaching effects of corporate marketing—and the powerful potential of a growing activist sect that will surely alter the course of the 21st century. First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, this is an infuriating, inspiring, and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money, marketing, and the anti-corporate movement.As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe—witness today's schoolbooks, superstores, sporting arenas, and brand-name synergy—a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative, well-written study, a front-line report on that battle, we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor, how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how ""culture jammers"" utilize spray paint, computer-hacking acumen, and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in ""Joe Chemo"" for ""Joe Camel"").No Logo will challenge and enlighten students of sociology, economics, popular culture, international affairs, and marketing.""This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule, and to lay out the particular set of cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable."" —Naomi Klein, from her Introduction",,,10/28/00,April 6th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Society', 'Cultural', 'Philosophy', 'Design']",,9780312421434,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441567914l/647._SY475_.jpg,3.88,['Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2000)'],277.0,4.0,,647.No_Logo,,,,,91.0,27276.0,528,,Picador,"['8126', '10669', '6118', '1699', '664']",,,[],,
Naomi Klein,The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,,English,,"In her ground-breaking reporting from Iraq, Naomi Klein exposed how the trauma of invasion was being exploited to remake the country in the interest of foreign corporations. She called it ""disaster capitalism."" Covering Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami, and New Orleans post-Katrina, she witnessed something remarkably similar. People still reeling from catastrophe were being hit again, this time with economic ""shock treatment"" losing their land and homes to rapid-fire corporate makeovers. The Shock Doctrine retells the story of the most dominant ideology of our time, Milton Friedman's free market economic revolution. In contrast to the popular myth of this movement's peaceful global victory, Klein shows how it has exploited moments of shock and extreme violence in order to implement its economic policies in so many parts of the world from Latin America and Eastern Europe to South Africa, Russia, and Iraq. At the core of disaster capitalism is the use of cataclysmic events to advance radical privatization combined with the privatization of the disaster response itself. By capitalizing on crises, created by nature or war, Klein argues that the disaster capitalism complex now exists as a booming new economy, and is the violent culmination of a radical economic project that has been incubating for fifty years.",,,09/18/06,September 18th 2007,"['Augusto Pinochet', 'Milton Friedman', 'Ewen Cameron', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'Lech Wałęsa', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Vladimir Lenin', 'Mikhail Gorbachev', 'Hajji Suharto', 'Nelson Mandela', 'Thabo Mbeki', 'Jeffrey Sachs']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'Political Science', 'Society', 'Social Justice']",,9780805079838,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442590618l/1237300._SY475_.jpg,4.24,"['Warwick Prize for Writing (2009)', 'Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non‐Fiction Book (2008)', 'British Columbia National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction Nominee (2008)']",1324.0,18.0,,1237300.The_Shock_Doctrine,,,,,95.0,38666.0,558,,Metropolitan Books,"['18897', '12841', '4820', '1354', '754']",,,"['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Uruguay', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil', 'United Kingdom', 'Indonesia', 'Russia', 'South Africa', 'Iraq', 'Sri Lanka']",,

But perhaps they are no longer alone in this opinion. Newly allied with the powerful African empire of the Tswana, the French have occupied Spain and brought revolution and bloodshed to Brazil, threatening Britain’s last desperate hope to defeat Napoleon.   And now the government that sidelined them has decided they have the best chance at negotiating a peace with the angry Tswana, who have besieged the Portuguese royal family in Rio—and thus offer to reinstate Laurence to his former rank and seniority as a captain in the Aerial Corps. Temeraire is delighted by this sudden reversal of fortune, but Laurence is by no means sanguine, knowing from experience that personal honor and duty to one’s country do not always run on parallel tracks.   Nonetheless, the pair embark for Brazil, only to meet with a string of unmitigated disasters that force them to make an unexpected landing in the hostile territory of the Incan empire, where they face new unanticipated dangers.   Now with the success of the mission balanced on a razor’s edge, and failure looking more likely by the minute, the unexpected arrival of an old enemy will tip the scales toward ruin.

Naomi Novik (Goodreads Author),Spinning Silver,,English,,"Miryem is the daughter and granddaughter of moneylenders, but her father's inability to collect his debts has left his family on the edge of poverty--until Miryem takes matters into her own hands. Hardening her heart, the young woman sets out to claim what is owed and soon gains a reputation for being able to turn silver into gold. When an ill-advised boast draws the attention of the king of the Staryk--grim fey creatures who seem more ice than flesh--Miryem's fate, and that of two kingdoms, will be forever altered. Set an impossible challenge by the nameless king, Miryem unwittingly spins a web that draws in a peasant girl, Wanda, and the unhappy daughter of a local lord who plots to wed his child to the dashing young tsar. But Tsar Mirnatius is not what he seems. And the secret he hides threatens to consume the lands of humans and Staryk alike.

Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly—some of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is ""not settled"" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole.

Narendra Jadhav,Untouchables,My Family's Triumphant Journey Out of the Caste System in Modern India,,Biography & Autobiography,"Every sixth human being in the world today is an Indian, and every sixth Indian is an untouchable. For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. In Untouchables, Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents -- their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables -- the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. Compelling and deeply compassionate, Untouchables is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today.",,,,2005.0,,,,0743270797,9780743270793,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k9hfQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.82,,,,,,,,,,,,320.0,,,,299.0,,,,

I didn’t think it would be a problem. I could handle a few bruises. What I hadn’t anticipated was landing on my back with Sculpt on top of me and my entire body burning up for him.I tried to ignore it.I failed of course. And having a hot, tattooed badass on top of me week after week, acting completely immune to what he was doing to my body—it was frustrating as hell, so I broke his rule—I complained.Then he kissed me.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb (Goodreads Author),The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,,English,,"A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. The Black Swan is a landmark book – itself a black swan.The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.",Incerto #2,,,May 15th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Finance', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Mathematics']",,9781400063512,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925471l/242472.jpg,3.94,['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2007)'],845.0,9.0,,242472.The_Black_Swan,,,,,91.0,85542.0,366,,Random House,"['29919', '30624', '17192', '5400', '2407']",,,[],,

For what he calls the ""antifragile"" is one step beyond robust, as it benefits from adversity, uncertainty and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, and proposing that things be built in an antifragile manner. Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragile provides a blueprint for how to behave-and thrive-in a world we don't understand and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand. He who is not antifragile will perish. Why is the city state better than the nation state, why is debt bad for you, and why is almost everything modern bound to fail?

Sorcerers, witches, no one could help. Now, in 1878, the Consel has the audacity to summon him and request that he find the very object they accused his former fiancée and him of stealing, Arrandale’s stone, which allowed them to travel in time. He refuses because he still blames their secret society for Amelia’s death. All he wants is to bring her back, even if it means searching for the stone himself with the help of his companion Marco Watts.

I wear many faces, a technique derived from being born prey. Many of us are victims of circumstance, our shackles wound tight from birth. My fellow victims of injustice will see all that is already so devastatingly familiar. For those more fortunate, you may wonder if such horrors exist at all. My very existence is forbidden and everyone I loved is dead. Yet I cling to this life which has brought me little more than the sharp point of a blade. I never made plans for growing old. I couldn’t afford to set myself up for such hopes, and I thought I was content with that burden—until I met him.  But everything comes at a price. And as I weave through this maze of thorns in hopes of reaching salvation, I fall down, bleed and dare to try again. For this man is more than an ache I cannot sooth, and whether I can admit it or not, he’s changed me; and the masks I so carefully wear, will no longer be enough. Authors Note: This story deals with heavy subject matter such as rape, murder, and slavery, and requires the reader to accept the fact that despite this fictional set, real life is fare graver than the words written on these pages.

Natasha Lukin (Goodreads Author),The Bride from Moscow,,English,,"Set against a backdrop of the collapse of the Soviet Empire, The Bride From Moscow follows the travails of a young Russian woman who seeks happiness and a better life in Australia.Svetlana is very much the archetypal Russian woman, like Anna Karenina — outwardly sentimental and passionate — but her strength, determination and conscientiousness emerges in Australia. Her personality has been tempered by fear and suspicion and bureaucracy, but she grows and finds courage through the course of the novel. In Australia, Svetlana finds herself unwittingly tangled in a web of intrigue involving reptile and bird smuggling to Malaysia, and must draw on her inherent honesty and commitment to a cause to deal with the situation. The repressive forces of the Soviet powers make life unbearable for Svetlana in her home country, and she leaves behind the memories of the tragic death of her first husband and an affair with a famous musician, and takes her teenage son to Melbourne. But Svetlana has escaped the political and cultural upheaval in her own country only to find more tragedy in Melbourne. Like many other women from war-torn countries, Svetlana is lured by the promise of a better life and a happy marriage with a Western man she hardly knows. Yet life in her new home seems never to be free from disappointment. Fate cruelly deals her several blows, culminating in her new husband’s death and the heartless interference by her late husband’s family. Thrown out onto the street and desperate, Svetlana is apprehended as a suspect in her Australian husband’s murder.She finds refuge only in a women’s shelter and must struggle to survive and prove her integrity. It is her destiny that is at stake, and the novel climaxes as Svetlana takes matters into her own hands. With new-found vigour, born of bearing blows for too long, she sets out to discover the secrets which surrounded her Melbourne husband’s life, and falls upon information regarding his son Peter’s involvement in some dirty business.The novel turns upon Svetlana’s dilemma: to reveal the information that can damage the people who could hurt her, or forever play the ignorant victim. Both choices are fraught with danger and consequence.A scene, in which Svetlana finally confronts Peter, marks the turning point in Svetlana’s life. Never before had she felt herself capable of such courage, and Peter, too, expects her to fall helpless to his threats. Both players unexpectedly change roles, and now Peter loses his power against a self-confident and forceful Svetlana. The experience draws on many migrants’ lives in a new country free of authoritarianism: Svetlana’s growing sense of self is assisted by a freer atmosphere. Yet Svetlana never truly feels she belongs in Australia, and after a time begins to see her old country in a new light.During this period Svetlana begins to re-structure her life, finds work and feels the deep need for a personal relationship. Dating clubs and introduction agencies play some part in her quest for a special man, but she still fondly remembers her ex-lover, the musician Boris. Her musings on that lost love and life with him are woven in with her attempts to expose the exploits of those whose dealings endanger her very life.Meanwhile, her teenage son, Victor, assimilates perfectly into his new environment, being accepted into a good Melbourne school, and finding future prospects for university entrance. On a trip to New Zeland he falls in love with a local girl and stays there to be with her. The consequence for his mother is devastating, as once again she is left alone. In desperation, she seeks the help of Boris, by telephoning him in Moscow, and discovers that he, too, had been reminiscing over their lost love.",,,,December 10th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B0198MINWC,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528254926l/40396484._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],99.0,1.0,,40396484-the-bride-from-moscow,,,,,100.0,6.0,191,,,"['6', '0', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Independently wealthy, the sisters spend their time dabbling in alchemy and the ancient Art of Memory—invented by the Greeks and used by alchemists and magi such as Giordano Bruno and Leonardo Da Vinci.

Silver's coverage is polymathic, ranging from poker and earthquakes to climate change and terrorism.""-New York Review of BooksNate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair's breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger-all by the time he was thirty. He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com. Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the ""prediction paradox"": The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good-or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary-and dangerous-science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver's insights are an essential read.",,,10/30/12,September 27th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Sociology', 'Social Science', 'Technology']",,9781594204111,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355058876l/13588394.jpg,3.98,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science (2013)']",148.0,3.0,,13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise,,,,,94.0,43175.0,534,,Penguin,"['13561', '18315', '8702', '1935', '662']",,,[],,

Nathan Erez (Goodreads Author),The Kabbalistic Murder Code,,,,"The Kabbalistic Murder Code is an original and innovative Israeli thriller that was written for all those having an interest in Kabbalah. It incorporates two seemingly unconnected elements: a string of strange murders and the deciphering of ancient Kabbalistic texts, along with their hidden and mystical meanings.A professor from Jerusalem, an expert in decoding ancient Hebrew manuscripts, is hired to carry out a mysterious task, one that sends him to three continents. He becomes entangled in a web of murders that leave him deeply puzzled. However, he quickly discovers that if he does not succeed in deciphering the enigmatic manuscripts, through his in-depth knowledge of Kabbalah, the lives of many people - including his own family - will be endangered.Interwoven within this exciting tale are curious passages reviewing the many conquests that the city of Jerusalem has endured during its long history. Their relevance and significance become clear only at the end of the book.The Kabbalistic Murder Code is an exciting and fast-paced thriller. Thanks to its unique structure and enriching subject matter (the secret wisdom of Kabbalah), you simply cannot put it down. The drama’s surprising solution integrates Kabbalistic elements and weaves the whole to a magical picture, leaving the reader almost breathless. It has been translated to date into four languages.

Instead, he founded our nation's leading nonprofit organization for protecting factory farmed animals. In Mercy For Animals, Nathan brings us into the trenches of his organization's work; from MFA's early days in grassroots activism, to dangerous and dramatic experiences doing undercover investigations, to the organization's current large-scale efforts at making sweeping legislative change to protect factory farmed animals and encourage compassionate food choices.But this isn't just Nathan's story. Mercy For Animals examines how our country moved from a network of small, local farms with more than 50 percent of Americans involved in agriculture to a massive coast-to-coast industrial complex controlled by a mere 1 percent of our population--and the consequences of this drastic change on animals as well as our global and local environments. We also learn how MFA strives to protect farmed animals in behind-the-scenes negotiations with companies like Nestle and other brand names--conglomerates whose policy changes can save countless lives and strengthen our planet. Alongside this unflinching snapshot of our current food system, readers are also offered hope and solutions--big and small--for ending mistreatment of factory farmed animals. From simple diet modifications to a clear explanation of how to contact corporations and legislators efficiently, Mercy For Animals proves that you don't have to be a hardcore vegan or an animal-rights activist to make a powerful difference in the lives of animals.",,,,September 12th 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Vegan', 'Animals', 'Activism', 'Food', 'Memoir', 'Biography']",,9780399574054,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498084242l/34272482.jpg,4.57,[],99.0,1.0,,34272482-mercy-for-animals,,,,,98.0,246.0,336,,Avery Publishing Group,"['164', '64', '14', '2', '2']",,,[],,

Around him he sees the great mass of inland Americans who have retired to California in expectation of health and ease.

Nathaniel Fick,One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer,,English,,"If the Marines are “the few, the proud,” Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick’s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle—Recon— two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he’ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.In this deeply thoughtful account of what it’s like to fight on today’s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn’t an option.

Nathaniel Philbrick (Goodreads Author),In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,,English,,"""With its huge, scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across, the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, In the Heart of the Sea will endure as a vital work of American history.",,First Edition,05/08/00,May 1st 2001,"['George Pollard', 'Thomas Nickerson', 'Owen Chase', 'Benjamin Lawrence', 'Matthew Joy', 'Thomas Chappel', 'Owen Coffin', 'Barzillai Ray']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Survival', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Maritime', 'Adult']",,9780141001821,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335902168l/17780.jpg,4.15,"['National Book Award for Nonfiction (2000)', 'Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2001)', 'Massachusetts Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2001)', 'ALA Alex Award (2001)']",788.0,13.0,,17780.In_the_Heart_of_the_Sea,,,,,95.0,84560.0,302,,Penguin Books,"['34610', '33321', '12708', '2542', '1379']",,,"['Nantucket, Massachusetts (United States)', 'South Pacific']",,

Nathaniel Philbrick (Goodreads Author),"The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn",,English,,"Watch a video Read discussion questions for ""The Last Stand.""The bestselling author of ""Mayflower"" sheds new light on one of the iconic stories of the American WestLittle Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the Spartans' defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo.In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George Armstrong Custer, one of the Union's greatest cavalry officers and a man with a reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the government's Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations.Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. ""The Last Stand"" is a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that continues to haunt our collective imagination.",,,,May 4th 2010,"['Alfred Terry', 'Frederick Benteen', 'Edward Godfrey', 'Thomas Weir', 'Fred Gerard', 'Grant Marsh', 'Winfield Scott Edgerly', 'Algernon Smith', 'Myles Keogh', 'Thomas McDougall', 'Charles Varnum', 'Private Roman Rutten', 'William Cooke', 'Myles Moylan', 'Joel Elliott', 'George Yates', 'George Crook', 'Francis Gibson', 'Mitch Boyer', 'White Bull', 'Charles Windolph', 'James Porter', 'James Calhoun', 'Frank Grouard', 'Young Hawk', 'George Herendeen', 'Jumping Bull', 'Left Hand', 'Nettie Smith', 'David Stanley', 'Monahsetah', 'Samuel Sturgis', 'Ben Clark', 'Luther Hare', 'Thomas Harrison', 'Kill Eagle', 'Little Big Man', 'Sylvester Knows Gun', 'Little Hawk', 'Bloody Knife', 'Mathey', 'John McGuire Jr.', 'Bull Head', 'James Flanagan', 'Edward Pigford', 'Lawrence Gobright', 'John Stands', 'Black Moon', 'Billy Garnett', 'Erwin C.

Neal Bascomb (Goodreads Author),Hunting Eichmann: How a Band of Survivors and a Young Spy Agency Chased Down the World's Most Notorious Nazi,,English,,"""Hunting Eichmann"" is the first complete narrative of a relentless and harrowing international manhunt.When the Allies stormed Berlin in the last days of the Third Reich, Adolf Eichmann shed his SS uniform and vanished. Following his escape from two American POW camps, his retreat into the mountains and out of Europe, and his path to an anonymous life in Buenos Aires, his pursuers are a bulldog West German prosecutor, a blind Argentinean Jew and his beautiful daughter, and a budding, ragtag spy agency called the Mossad, whose operatives have their own scores to settle (and whose rare surveillance photographs are published here for the first time). The capture of Eichmann and the efforts by Israeli agents to secret him out of Argentina to stand trial is the stunning conclusion to this thrilling historical account, told with the kind of pulse-pounding detail that rivals anything you'd find in great spy fiction.",,,,April 1st 2009,['Adolf Eichmann'],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'True Crime', 'Biography', 'War', 'Espionage', 'Historical', 'Israel']",,9780618858675,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348904011l/4778436.jpg,4.22,[],58.0,1.0,,4778436-hunting-eichmann,,,,,97.0,5203.0,390,,Houghton Mifflin,"['2152', '2219', '676', '114', '42']",,,"['Germany', 'Buenos Aires (Argentina)', 'Israel']",,
"Neal Boortz, John Linder",The FairTax Book: Saying Goodbye to the Income Tax and the IRS,,English,,"Wouldn't you love to abolish the IRS ...Keep all the money in your paycheck ...Pay taxes on what you spend, not what you earn ...And eliminate all the fraud, hassle, and waste of our current system?Then the FairTax is for you. In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.As Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will:Make America's tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenueReplace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales taxProtect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessitiesEliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're payingBring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economyEndorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself.

Neal Gabler (Goodreads Author),Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination,,English,,"From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of ""Walt Disney's America."" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",,,,October 31st 2006,['Walt Disney'],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Business', 'Film', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Art', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']",,9780679438229,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353778664l/118824.jpg,4.06,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (2006)'],93.0,1.0,,118824.Walt_Disney,,,,,91.0,8814.0,851,,Alfred A.

A futuristic Frankenstein, Cam struggles with a search for identity and meaning and wonders if a rewound being can have a soul.

Neal Stephenson,Cryptonomicon,,,Fiction,"With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Neal Stephenson (Goodreads Author),The System of the World,,English,,"The System of the World, the third and concluding volume of Neal Stephenson's shelf-bending Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver and The Confusion), brings the epic historical saga to its thrilling - and truly awe-inspiring - conclusion.Set in the early 18th century and featuring a diverse cast of characters that includes alchemists, philosophers, mathematicians, spies, thieves, pirates, and royalty, The System of the World follows Daniel Waterhouse, an unassuming philosopher and confidant to some of the most brilliant minds of the age, as he returns to England to try and repair the rift between geniuses Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device. Having been away from the war-decimated country for two decades, Waterhouse quickly learns that although many things have changed, there is still violent revolution simmering just beneath the surface of seemingly civilized society. With Queen Anne deathly ill and Tories and Whigs jostling for political supremacy, Waterhouse and Newton vow to figure out who is trying to kill certain scientists and decipher the riddle behind the legend of King Solomon's gold, a mythical hoard of precious metal with miraculous properties.Arguably one of the most ambitious -- and most researched -- stories ever written, Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is set in one of the most turbulent and exciting times in human history. Filled with wild adventure, political intrigue, social upheaval, civilization-changing discoveries, cabalistic mysticism, and even a little romance, this massive saga is worth its weight in (Solomon's) gold.

Neal Stephenson (Goodreads Author),Anathem,,English,,"Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside ""saecular"" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside—the Extramuros—for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates—at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster.

Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.",,,,September 20th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Cyberpunk', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels']",,9780061977961,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1305993115l/10552338.jpg,3.97,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2011)'],198.0,2.0,,10552338-reamde,,,,,93.0,51591.0,1044,,William Morrow,"['16912', '21013', '9994', '2755', '917']",,,"['Xiamen (China)', 'Seattle, Washington (United States)', 'British Columbia (Canada)']",,
Neal Stephenson (Goodreads Author),Cryptonomicon,,English,,"Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.",,,05/28/99,11/05/02,"['Douglas MacArthur', 'Enoch Root', 'Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse', 'Robert Shaftoe', 'Earl Comstock', 'Rudolf von Hacklheber', 'Alan Turing']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Thriller', 'Historical', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'War', 'Fantasy', 'Novels']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327931476l/816.jpg,4.24,"['Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (2000)', 'Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (2013)', 'Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel (2000)', 'Arthur C.

"Neal Stephenson (Goodreads Author), Nicole Galland (Goodreads Author)",The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.,,English,,"From bestselling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world ""jams"" the ""frequencies"" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why.And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart.Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.",D.O.D.O. #1,,06/13/17,June 15th 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780008132569,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489501261l/32794590.jpg,3.87,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science Fiction (2017)'],93.0,1.0,,32794590-the-rise-and-fall-of-d-o-d-o,,,,,91.0,24237.0,753,,The Borough Press,"['6744', '9979', '5428', '1684', '402']",,,[],,

Neale Donald Walsch,Tomorrow's God: Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge,,English,,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The New Revelations and Conversations with God comes a galvanizing vision of spirituality unlike anything you've experienced before....  Humanity is about to create a new form of spirituality on earth.

In Tomorrow's God, Walsch offers compelling reasons why adopting this new belief system is in the best interests of humankind -- now.  Tomorrow's God contains an astonishing prediction, one that comes from an astonishing source: God. Presented as a conversation between God and Walsch, this startling, profound book is offered in two parts: Part One deals with humanity's current conception of God, and the new ideas about the Deity that will characterize God in our not-too-distant future. Part Two examines how these ideals will be put into place -- and how they will impact our lives, and help us to create a newer, better world.

In Imchouk, it was expected that Badra's life should be limited by her husband's wishes, but at Aunt Selma's, Badra begins to think about how she wants to live from now on. She recalls her youthful curiosity about sex — what other girls' and women's bodies were like, her first attempts to spy on men, her fascination with the two beautiful prostitute sisters who lived outside Imchouk. When she develops a passionate, consuming relationship with a wealthy doctor, Badra remembers and rediscovers her own sexual being, in scenes that are erotic, revelatory, and sometimes bittersweet.C.

Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

Neil Gaiman (Goodreads Author),Norse Mythology,,English,,"Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok. In Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki—son of a giant—blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator.Gaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.",,,02/07/17,March 6th 2018,"['Odin', 'Thor (Norse Mythology)', 'Loki']",Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Retellings', 'Religion']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1516128292l/37903770._SX318_.jpg,4.08,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy (2017)'],1139.0,13.0,,37903770-norse-mythology,,,,,96.0,214833.0,301,,W.

After his 70 year imprisonment and eventual escape, Dream, also known as Morpheus, goes on a quest for his lost objects of power.

"Neil Gaiman (Goodreads Author), Yoshitaka Amano (Illustrator)",The Sandman: The Dream Hunters,,English,,"Sandman fans should feel lucky that master fantasy writer Neil Gaiman discovered the mythical world of Japanese fables while researching his translation of Hayao Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke. At the same time, while preparing for the Sandman 10th anniversary, he met Yoshitaka Amano, his artist for the 11th Sandman book. Amano is the famed designer of the Final Fantasy game series. The product of Gaiman's immersion in Japanese art, culture, and history, Sandman: Dream Hunters is a classic Japanese tale (adapted from ""The Fox, the Monk, and the Mikado of All Night's Dreaming"") that he has subtly morphed into his Sandman universe.Like most fables, the story begins with a wager between two jealous animals, a fox and a badger: which of them can drive a young monk from his solitary temple? The winner will make the temple into a new fox or badger home. But as the fox adopts the form of a woman to woo the monk from his hermitage, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, in far away Kyoto, the wealthy Master of Yin-Yang, the onmyoji, is plagued by his fears and seeks tranquility in his command of sorcery. He learns of the monk and his inner peace; he dispatches demons to plague the monk in his dreams and eventually kill him to bring his peace to the onmyoji. The fox overhears the demons on their way to the monk and begins her struggle to save the man whom at first she so envied.Dream Hunters is a beautiful package. From the ink-brush painted endpapers to the luminous page layouts--including Amano's gate-fold painting of Morpheus in a sea of reds, oranges, and violets--this book has been crafted for a sensuous reading experience. Gaiman has developed as a prose stylist in the last several years with novels and stories such as Neverwhere and Stardust, and his narrative rings with a sense of timelessness and magic that gently sustains this adult fairy tale. The only disappointment here is that the book is so brief. One could imagine this creative team being even better suited to a longer story of more epic proportions. On the final page of Dream Hunters, in fact, Amano suggest that he will collaborate further with Mr. Gaiman in the future. Readers of Dream Hunters will hope that Amano's dream comes true. --Patrick O'Kelley",The Sandman #Prose novella,,10/28/99,2000,"['Dream of the Endless', 'Matthew the Raven', 'Cain (DC Comics)', 'Abel (DC Comics)', 'Mildred (Hecatae)', 'Mordred/Morganna (Hecatae)', 'Cynthia (Hecatae)']",Paperback,"['Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Mythology', 'Comic Book', 'Horror', 'Japan', 'Art']",,9781840232042,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327940077l/166580.jpg,4.4,"['Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative (2000)', 'Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work (2000)', 'Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards for Best Comics-Related Book (2000)']",271.0,4.0,,166580.The_Sandman,,,,,98.0,18551.0,128,,Titan Books Ltd.,"['10196', '5898', '2148', '254', '55']",,,['Japan'],,

"Neil Strauss (Goodreads Author) (Editor), Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy Lee",The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band,,English,,"Whiskey and porn stars, hot reds and car crashes, black leather and high heels, overdoses and death. This is the life of Mötley Crüe, the heaviest drinking, hardest fighting, most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks, started the bloodiest fights, partied with the biggest drug dealers, and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme, from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed, rose from the dead, and then OD'd again the next day; and Mick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol, driven by fury and headed straight for hell, Mötley Crüe raged through two decades, leaving behind a trail of debauched women, trashed hotel rooms, crashed cars, psychotic managers, and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts, not to mention their dire consequences, are laid bare in The Dirt.Here -- directly from Nikki, Vince, Tommy, and Mick -- is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious, gut-wrenching story. In these pages, published for the first time anywhere, are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison: Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter -- and the train wreck that his life became afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment, his discovery of the family he never knew he had -- and his subsequent loss of them. And all of it accompanied by scores of rare, never-before-published photographs, mug shots, and handwritten lyrics. No one is spared. Not David Lee Roth, Ozzy Osbourne, Vanity, Aerosmith, Heather Locklear, AC/DC, Lita Ford, Iron Maiden, Pamela Anderson, Guns N' Roses, Donna D'Errico, RATT, or those two girls from Dallas, Texas.Make no mistake about it: these guys are geniuses. They invented glam metal and then left it in the dust; sold more than forty million albums from Shout at the Devil to Dr. Feelgood; toured the world dozen times and have the scars to prove it; and maintained a rabid following in an era of throwaway pop stars. Mötley Crüe has done nothing less than tattoo the psyche of the entire MTV generation. They are the ultimate rock 'n' roll band. And if you don't believe it, read The Dirt.

Neil Strauss;Bernard Chang,How to Make Money Like a Porn Star,,,Comics & Graphic Novels,"Claudia Corvette. From her tousled bedroom hair to her name–all the porn stars in this world take their names from supermodels and sports cars–she is adult entertainment's prototypical femme fatale. Her life is the collision of countless troubled–childhood cliches and grown–up wet dreams, projected onto her as surely as her videos project their blue light onto lonely men around the world.

In the hands of Rolling Stone writer Neil Strauss and illustrator Bernard Chang, this adult graphic novel weaves together black humor and blacker reality.

Ante este nuevo mundo feliz, Turok llama a reinventar creativamente la manera de desarrollar y compartir el conocimiento avanzado, y a hacer posible el acceso a los enormes depósitos de talento intelectual, todavía por explorar, del mundo en vías de desarrollo.

Neil Young,Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream,,English,,"For the first time, legendary singer, songwriter, and guitarist Neil Young offers a kaleidoscopic view of his personal life and musical creativity. He tells of his childhood in Ontario, where his father instilled in him a love for the written word; his first brush with mortality when he contracted polio at the age of five; struggling to pay rent during his early days with the Squires; traveling the Canadian prairies in Mort, his 1948 Buick hearse; performing in a remote town as a polar bear prowled beneath the floorboards; leaving Canada on a whim in 1966 to pursue his musical dreams in the pot-filled boulevards and communal canyons of Los Angeles; the brief but influential life of Buffalo Springfield, which formed almost immediately after his arrival in California. He recounts their rapid rise to fame and ultimate break-up; going solo and overcoming his fear of singing alone; forming Crazy Horse and writing “Cinnamon Girl,” “Cowgirl in the Sand,” and “Down by the River” in one day while sick with the flu; joining Crosby, Stills & Nash, recording the landmark CSNY album, Déjà vu, and writing the song, “Ohio;” life at his secluded ranch in the redwoods of Northern California and the pot-filled jam sessions there; falling in love with his wife, Pegi, and the birth of his three children; and finally, finding the contemplative paradise of Hawaii.

A unique chronicle of a young man who at one time was both nerd and jock, Tyson’s memoir could well inspire other similarly curious youngsters to pursue their dreams.Like many athletic kids he played baseball, won medals in track and swimming, and was captain of his high school wrestling team. But at the same time he was setting up a telescope on winter nights, taking an advanced astronomy course at the Hayden Planetarium, and spending a summer vacation at an astronomy camp in the Mojave Desert.Eventually, his scientific curiosity prevailed, and he went on to graduate in physics from Harvard and to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Columbia. There followed postdoctoral research at Princeton. In 1996, he became the director of the Hayden Planetarium, where some twenty-five years earlier he had been awed by the spectacular vista in the sky theater.Tyson pays tribute to the key teachers and mentors who recognized his precocious interests and abilities, and helped him succeed. He intersperses personal reminiscences with thoughts on scientific literacy, careful science vs. media hype, the possibility that a meteor could someday hit the Earth, dealing with society’s racial stereotypes, what science can and cannot say about the existence of God, and many other interesting insights about science, society, and the nature of the universe.Now available in paperback with a new preface and other additions, this engaging memoir will enlighten and inspire an appreciation of astronomy and the wonders of our universe.",,,11/05/00,May 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Astronomy', 'Memoir', 'Physics', 'Space', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Popular Science']",,9781591021889,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365462868l/120417.jpg,4.14,[],74.0,1.0,,120417.The_Sky_Is_Not_the_Limit,,,,,97.0,1242.0,203,,Prometheus Books,"['484', '497', '223', '26', '12']",,,[],,

Nell Irvin Painter,The History of White People,,English,,"A mind-expanding and myth-destroying exploration of “whiteness”—an illuminating work on the history of race and power. Eminent historian Nell Irvin Painter tells perhaps the most important forgotten story in American history. Beginning at the roots of Western civilization, she traces the invention of the idea of a white race—often for economic, scientific, and political ends. She shows how the origins of American identity in the eighteenth century were intrinsically tied to the elevation of white skin into the embodiment of beauty, power, and intelligence; how the great American intellectuals— including Ralph Waldo Emerson—insisted that only Anglo Saxons were truly American; and how the definitions of who is “white” and who is “American” have evolved over time.  A story filled with towering historical figures, The History of White People closes an enormous gap in a literature that has long focused on the nonwhite, and it forcefully reminds us that the concept of “race” is an all-too-human invention whose meaning, importance, and reality have changed according to a long and rich history. 70 illustrations.",,,,March 15th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Sociology', 'Anti Racist', 'American History', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural']",,9780393049343,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349005576l/6919721.jpg,4.03,[],54.0,1.0,,6919721-the-history-of-white-people,,,,,94.0,2229.0,512,,W.

"Nella Larsen, Ntozake Shange (Introduction), Thadious Davis (Editor)",Passing,,English,,"Alternate Cover Edition can be found here. First published to critical acclaim in 1929, Passing firmly established Nella Larsen's prominence among women writers of the Harlem Renaissance. The Modern Library is proud to present Passing—an electrifying story of two women who cross the color line in 1920s New York—together with a new Introduction by the Obie Award- winning playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange.Irene Redfield, the novel's protagonist, is a woman with an enviable life. She and her husband, Brian, a prominent physician, share a comfortable Harlem town house with their sons. Her work arranging charity balls that gather Harlem's elite creates a sense of purpose and respectability for Irene. But her hold on this world begins to slip the day she encounters Clare Kendry, a childhood friend with whom she had lost touch. Clare—light-skinned, beautiful, and charming—tells Irene how, after her father's death, she left behind the black neighborhood of her adolescence and began passing for white, hiding her true identity from everyone, including her racist husband. As Clare begins inserting herself into Irene's life, Irene is thrown into a panic, terrified of the consequences of Clare's dangerous behavior. And when Clare witnesses the vibrancy and energy of the community she left behind, her burning desire to come back threatens to shatter her careful deception.Brilliantly plotted and elegantly written, Passing offers a gripping psychological portrait of emotional extremity.",,Penguin Classics,10/28/29,April 24th 2003,"['Irene Redfield', 'Clare Kendry', 'Brian Redfield', 'Gertrude Martin', 'Hugh Wentworth', 'John Bellow']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'African American', 'Race', 'School', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', '20th Century']",,9780142437278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388214730l/349929.jpg,3.88,[],272.0,4.0,,349929.Passing,,,,,94.0,22003.0,122,,Penguin,"['5549', '9625', '5579', '1038', '212']",,,"['Chicago, Illinois (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', 'Harlem, New York City, New York (United States)', 'United States of America', 'New York State (United States)']",,

In this next instalment of her unique diaries, Nella Last describes how ordinary people re-built their lives after the war was over.While the Allies' victory was a cause for hope and celebration, much privation and anxiety remained. 'The only peace is that there are no active hostilities,' Nella wrote, 'but the corrosion of the war years is eating deeper into civilisation.' In her sensitive and playful account of daily life in the austerity years, written like her war diaries for the Mass Observation project, Nella Last captures the thoughts and feelings of post-war Britain.'If the historians could see clearly enough, this could well be called the age of frustration ... after all, for ordinary people, it's the little things that count, whether for good or ill.'

When war broke out, Nella's younger son joined the army while the rest of the family tried to adapt to civilian life. Writing each day for the ""Mass Observation"" project, Nella, a middle-aged housewife from the bombed town of Barrow, shows what people really felt during this time. This was the period in which she turned 50, saw her children leave home, and reviewed her life and her marriage - which she eventually compares to slavery. Her growing confidence as a result of her war work makes this a moving (though often comic) testimony, which, covering sex, death and fear of invasion, provides a new, unglamorised, female perspective on the war years.

Nelson DeMille (Goodreads Author),Wild Fire,,English,,"
  From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nelson DeMille comes a suspenseful new novel featuring Detective John Corey and an all-too-plausible conspiracy to detonate a nuclear bomb in two major American cities.
Welcome to the Custer Hill Club--an informal men's club set in a luxurious Adirondack hunting lodge whose members include some of America's most powerful business leaders, military men, and government officials. Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics. But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate. Their plan is finalized and set into motion. That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing. His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve. The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts. As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire. 
  Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.

Nelson DeMille (Goodreads Author),The Lion's Game,,English,,"
  The Barnes & Noble Review
 January 2000 Since the publication of his first novel, By the Rivers of Babylon, in 1978, Nelson DeMille has produced a steady stream of intelligent, hard-edged, contemporary thrillers, the best of which  such as Cathedral, The Gold Coast, or Word of Honor  are absolute models of the form. It's a pleasure to be able to report that The Lion's Game, DeMille's tenth novel is as shrewdly constructed and compulsively readable as anything he has published to date. Weighing in at nearly 700 pages, The Lion's Game is the longest, most ambitious novel of DeMille's career. It is also his first attempt at a sequel, bringing us a new installment in the colorful career of John Corey, the acerbic narrator/hero of 1997's Plum Island. When last seen, Corey had interrupted his convalescent leave from the NYPD long enough to solve a bizarre double murder on Long Island's Eastern Shore, after which, he formally separated from the police department and became an adjunct professor at John Jay University. Not unexpectedly, Corey grew bored with the uneventful world of academia and decided to return, in a very different capacity, to the front lines of law enforcement. Admirers of Plum Island will be pleased to learn that he is as ornery, insubordinate, and politically incorrect as ever.  The novel opens on April 15th. Corey has just signed on with the Middle Eastern division of the ATTF (Anti-Terrorist Task Force), an organization staffed by an uneasy combination of FBI, CIA, and NYPD operatives. Corey's firstassignmenttakes him to JFK Airport, where, together with an assortment of teammates, he is scheduled to take custody of a defecting Libyan terrorist. The terrorist in question is Asad Khalil, a.k.a. the Lion, the man believed to be responsible for a series of attacks on Americans living in Europe. As Corey and company await the arrival of Khalil and his escorts, it quickly becomes apparent that something has gone seriously wrong.  To begin with, the plane, for unknown reasons, drops out of radio contact hours before its arrival in New York. Eventually, ignoring all commands from Air Traffic Control personnel, the flight lands at JFK in an odd, erratic fashion, taxis to a stop, and proceeds to sit, silent and motionless, on the runway. Unable to establish communication, airport authorities force their way onboard, only to find that a tragedy of unprecedented proportions has occurred and that Asad Khalil, the man responsible for that tragedy, is nowhere to be found, having slipped through the crowd of investigators and made his escape.  The bulk of the novel concerns the protracted hunt for an implacable killer with a very personal mission. It would spoil a number of DeMille's expertly constructed effects to reveal too much of what happens as The Lion's Game unfolds. But here, briefly, is the fundamental premise that dominates this book.  April 15th, the day Khalil's plane arrives at JFK, is not simply income tax day. It is also the anniversary of the 1986 bombing of Libya, a mission ordered by Ronald Reagan in direct response to a series of atrocities reputedly set in motion by Libyan president Moammar Gadhafi. Asad Khalil, who was 16-years-old when the bombing occurred, lost his entire family that day and developed an undying hatred for all things American. Acting both on his own behalf and on behalf of the Great Leader Gadhafi, he has made his way to America, where he is determined to wage a holy war against the murderers of his family.  As Khalil's history, intentions, and specific agenda gradually become clear, Corey leads a diverse group of experts in an increasingly desperate attempt to anticipate the Lion's movements and prevent him from implementing his bloody, ironic endgame. As the lengthy narrative unrolls, The Lion's Game moves backward in time from the present day to the night of the fateful bombing in 1986; the action shifts from New York City to Florida and from Florida to the Pacific Coast, as DeMille skillfully switches back and forth from the first-person viewpoint of John Corey to a third-person narrative that takes us into the deranged perspective of Asad Khalil. The result is a big, wide-ranging novel that is alternately funny and frightening; one that achieves an astonishing, almost effortless narrative momentum; one that is grounded in DeMille's tragic view of the endlessly replicated blood feuds that dominate the landscape of 20th-century geopolitics.  From its eerie opening sequence to its deliberately open-ended conclusion, THE LION'S GAME is the clear product of a world-class storyteller, a man who seems incapable of turning out a bland or boring paragraph. DeMille is at the top of his own game in this one and has written a novel that will inevitably command a large, enthusiastic audience. I, for one, am glad to see it. In a field too often populated by formulaic, by-the-numbers fiction, Nelson DeMille is an undisguised blessing. I wish him health, success, and undiminished productivity in the decades to come.

Nelson Mandela,Long Walk to Freedom,,English,,"Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.",Long Walk to Freedom #1-2,,10/28/94,October 1st 1995,['Nelson Mandela'],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Africa', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'South Africa', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race']",,9780316548182,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327997342l/318431.jpg,4.33,['Alan Paton Award (1995)'],3581.0,44.0,,318431.Long_Walk_to_Freedom,,,,,96.0,67778.0,656,,Back Bay Books,"['36085', '21649', '7405', '1549', '1090']",,,[],,

Estimated to extend for more than three hundred miles, only ninety of them mapped, the cave was formed by acid burning away the limestone; corridors, pits, cramped wormholes, cliffs, and splendid rooms the size of football fields tangle together in a maze shrouded in the utter darkness of the underground. When a fellow ranger is injured in a caving accident, Anna swallows her paralyzing fear of small spaces and descends into Lechuguilla to help a friend in need. Worse than the claustrophobia that haunts her are the signs - some natural and some, more ominously, manmade - that not everyone is destined to emerge from this wondrous living tomb.

Newt Gingrich (Goodreads Author),To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine,,English,,"In his blockbuster new book, To Save America, former Speaker of the House and bestselling author Newt Gingrich issues a dire warning for America. By spending more than we can afford, sacrificing conservative values for the sake of easy answers, and electing the most liberal president ever, America is at risk for its very survival. Thanks to President Obama and his cohorts in Congress, we have become a country defined by massive government takeovers, rising debt, and failing national security systems. “This is not the nation our Founding Fathers envisioned,” Gingrich says, “America needs saving, and it’s up to us to do it.” In To Save America, Gingrich lays out a bold plan to put the United States back on track. Gingrich shows how Republicans can make a comeback in the 2010 mid-term elections, win the 2012 presidential election, and reveals how readers can help restore our nation to its fundamental values. Gingrich also argues that the big-spending, big-government programs, and bureaucracies of the secular socialist Left are the greatest threat to our nation’s survival since the Civil War. “Our federal government is broken,” Gingrich states, “we must ‘replace, not reform’ our leaders and our policies, or America will no longer be the ‘shining city upon a hill.’” Fresh, inspiring, and resolute, To Save America is Gingrich’s most powerful book yet.",,,04/27/10,May 17th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Political Science']",,9781596985964,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439850509l/8162282._SY475_.jpg,3.55,[],48.0,1.0,,8162282-to-save-america,,,,,82.0,232.0,356,,Regnery Publishing,"['60', '68', '63', '21', '20']",,,[],,

With a forceful and compassionate voice, Pizzolatto finds beauty in loneliness as his characters attempt to bridge the gulfs between themselves and others, past and present, and, sometimes, between their inner and outer selves. In this both heartbreaking and humorous collection, we meet a base-jumping, samurai park ranger who parachutes off the St. Louis Arch; a stained glass artist who struggles over his masterpiece and learns through great loss what his true subject will be; and a religious elementary school teacher who tries to understand her rebellious, militant son. In the title story, which first appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, an orphaned young man and his former high school football coach set out to kidnap the coach’s daughter from Los Angeles and bring her back to east Texas. With an assured, poignant voice, Pizzolatto places us at the crossroads of memory and desire, somewhere between here and the Yellow Sea. ",,,05/16/06,January 15th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Literature', 'American', 'Southern', 'Audiobook', 'Noir', 'Americana']",,9781596921689,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391480535l/8623763.jpg,3.73,[],56.0,1.0,,8623763-between-here-and-the-yellow-sea,,,,,91.0,1133.0,275,,MP Publishing Limited,"['233', '478', '318', '86', '18']",,,[],,

When an aging playboy, Graziano Biglia, returns to town, a change is in the air: Pietro decides to take on the bullies, his lonely teacher Flora finds romance with the town’s prodigal son, and the inept janitor at the school proclaims his love for his favorite prostitute.

So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8.

In his fifth work to examine a specific aspect of book culture, Basbanes also asks what we can know about such figures as John Milton, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Adams, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Henry James, Thomas Edison, Helen Keller––even the notorious Marquis de Sade and Adolf Hitler––by knowing what they have read.

Nicholas Carr (Goodreads Author),The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains,,English,,"“Is Google making us stupid?” When Nicholas Carr posed that question, in a celebrated Atlantic Monthly cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the Internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net’s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply?Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet’s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by “tools of the mind”—from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer—Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways.Building on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic—a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption—and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection.Part intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes—Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive—even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche.

Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women’s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy.

In eight carefully connected stories that are joined by introspective interludes on related subjects, the author pursues the notion, through the lives of a couple seen by different narrators, that ""those who like unhappy ends can have them, and those who don't will have to look for them.""The impossible object of the title, ""the triangle that can exist in two dimensions but not in three,"" is a controlling symbol for the impossibility of realizing the good life unless one recognizes the impossibility of attaining it: only then can it be possible to realize it, through a kind of renunciation, especially in ""a sophisticated, corrupt, chaotic world.""

Nicholas Murray,Aldous Huxley,An English Intellectual,,Great Britain,"The grandson of biologist T. H. Huxley, Aldous Huxley had a privileged background and was educated at Eton and Oxford despite an eye infection that left him nearly blind. Having learned braille his eyesight then improved enough for him to start writing, and by the 1920s he had become a fashionable figure, producing witty and daring novels like CROME YELLOW (1921), ANTIC HAY (1923) and POINT COUNTER POINT (1928). But it is as the author of his celebrated portrayal of a nightmare future society, BRAVE NEW WORLD (1932), that Huxley is remembered today. A truly visionary book, it was a watershed in Huxley's world-view as his later work became more and more optimistic - coinciding with his move to California and experimentation with mysticism and psychedelic drugs later in life.

Nicholas Shaxson, a former correspondent for the Financial Times and The Economist, argues that tax havens are a central cause of all these disasters.In this hard hitting investigation he uncovers how offshore tax evasion, which has cost the U.S. 100 billion dollars in lost revenue each year, is just one item on a long rap sheet outlining the damage that offshoring wreaks on our societies. In a riveting journey from Moscow to London to Switzerland to Delaware, Shaxson dives deep into a vast and secret playground where bankers and multinational corporations operate side by side with nefarious tax evaders, organized criminals and the world's wealthiest citizens. Tax havens are where all these players get to maximize their own rewards and leave the middle class to pick up the bill.With eye opening revelations, Treasure Islands exposes the culprits and its victims, and shows how:*Over half of world trade is routed through tax havens*The rampant practices that precipitated the latest financial crisis can be traced back to Wall Street's offshoring practices*For every dollar of aid we send to developing countries, ten dollars leave again by the backdoorThe offshore system sits much closer to home than the pristine tropical islands of the popular imagination. In fact, it all starts on a tiny island called Manhattan. In this fast paced narrative, Treasure Islands at last explains how the system works and how it's contributing to our ever deepening economic divide.",,,January 6th 2011,April 12th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Business', 'History', 'Taxation', 'Crime', 'Society', 'World History']",,9780230105010,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312071994l/10197857.jpg,4.2,['Bread and Roses Award Nominee for Shortlist (2012)'],21.0,1.0,,10197857-treasure-islands,,,,,96.0,1363.0,272,,St. Martin's Press,"['594', '517', '199', '37', '16']",,,[],,

Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.

With a degree from Duke Law School and a job at a prestigious firm in Wilmington, she is a dark-haired beauty with a seemingly flawless professional track record.

Nicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author),The Longest Ride,,English,,"Ira Levinson is in trouble. At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago.

Nicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author),A Walk to Remember,,English,,"There was a time when the world was sweeter...when the women in Beaufort, North Carolina, wore dresses, and the men donned hats...when something happened to a seventeen-year-old boy that would change his life forever. Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories.

Though it is intensely personal, he decided to publish it in the hope that some of those who sit on the mourning bench for children would find his words giving voice to their own honoring and grieving. What he learned, to his surprise, is that in its particularity there is universality. Many who have lost children have written him. But many who have lost other relatives have done so as well, along with many who have experienced loss in forms other than the death of relatives or friends. The sharply particular words of Lament, so he has learned, give voice to the pain of many forms of loss. This book, Lament For A Son, has become a love-song. Every lament, after all, is a love-song.

Nicholson Baker (Goodreads Author),"Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, The End of Civilization",,English,,"At a time when the West seems ever more eager to call on military aggression as a means of securing international peace, Nicholson Baker's provocative narrative exploring the political misjudgements and personal biases that gave birth to the terrifying consequences of the Second World War could not be more pertinent.With original and controversial insights brought about by meticulous research, Human Smokere-evaluates the political turning points that led up to war and in so doing challenges some of the treasured myths we hold about how war came about and how atrocities like the Holocaust were able to happen. Baker reminds us, for instance, not to forget that it was thanks in great part to Churchill and England that Mussolini ascended to power so quickly, and that, before leading the United States against Nazi Germany, a young FDR spent much of his time lobbying for a restriction in the number of Jews admitted to Harvard. Conversely, Human Smokealsoreminds us of those who had the foresight to anticipate the coming bloodshed and the courage to oppose the tide of history, as Gandhi demonstrated when he made his symbolic walk to the ocean -- for which he was immediately imprisoned by the British.Praised by critics and readers alike for his gifted writing and exquisitely observant eye, Baker offers a combination of sweeping narrative history and a series of finely delineated vignettes of the individuals and moments that shaped history that is guaranteed to spark new dialogue on the subject.",,,11/06/08,March 11th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'Holocaust', 'Military History', 'European History', 'World History', 'Germany']",,9781416567844,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366341105l/1948985.jpg,3.99,"['J.

But she threatens to become embodied--to appear on his doorstep, in fact. So he runs.Faced with the terrifying prospect of meeting his own fictional character, Griffin runs. His journey begins conventionally--tracing a course through Europe and the Mediterranean--but slowly Griffin begins to realize that he is traveling backward in time, drifting through layers of dead civilizations and his own soul. His precarious link to reality is the possibly unreal Sabine, who is living in his house in London and keeping a notebook of his letters and her responses.Once again, the story is told in strangely beautiful postcards and richly decorated letters that must actually be removed from their envelopes to be read.

And it is Euchrid, spiraling ever deeper into his mad angelic vision, who will ultimately redeem both the town and its people. “Surprising, remarkable.” — The Atlanta Journal",,,10/28/89,March 26th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Horror', 'Novels', 'Gothic', 'Southern Gothic', 'Contemporary', 'Music', 'Cult Classics', 'Dark', 'Drama']",,9781880985724,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388399578l/68682.jpg,3.76,[],1266.0,15.0,,68682.And_the_Ass_Saw_the_Angel,,,,,86.0,10441.0,320,,2.13.61,"['3167', '3561', '2280', '901', '532']",,,[],,
Nick Cohen,What's Left?,,English,,"From the witty and excoriating voice of journalist Nick Cohen, a powerful and irreverent dissection of the agonies, idiocies and compromises of mainstream liberal thought. He comes from the Left. When he was a child, his mother would search supermarket shelves for politically reputable citrus fruit, and despair. Aged 13, when he learned his kind and thoughtful English teacher voted Conservative, he nearly fell off his chair: 'To be good, you had to be on the Left.' Today he's no less confused. When he looks around him, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, he sees a community of Left-leaning liberals standing on their heads. Why do apologies for a militant Islam standing for everything the liberal-Left is against come from a section of it? After the US/UK wars in Bosnia and Kosovo against Milosevic's ethnic cleansers, why were some on the Left denying the existence of Serb concentration camps? Why is Palestine a cause for the liberal-Left, but not, for instance, China, the Sudan, Zimbabwe or North Korea? Why can't those who say they support the Palestinian cause tell you what type of Palestine they'd like to see? After the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC, why were you as likely to read that a conspiracy of Jews controlled US or UK foreign policy in a liberal literary journal as in a neo-Nazi rag? It's easy to know what the Left is fighting against--the evils of Bush and corporations--but what and who are they fighting for? As he tours the follies of the Left, he asks us to reconsider what it means to be liberal today. With the angry satire of Swift, he reclaims the values of democracy and solidarity that united the movement against fascism, asking: What's Left?.",,1st Edition,,2007,"['George W.

Nick Cutter (Goodreads Author),The Deep,,English,,"From the acclaimed author of The Troop—which Stephen King raved “scared the hell out of me and I couldn’t put it down.…old-school horror at its best”—comes this utterly terrifying novel where The Abyss meets The Shining.A strange plague called the ’Gets is decimating humanity on a global scale. It causes people to forget—small things at first, like where they left their keys…then the not-so-small things like how to drive, or the letters of the alphabet. Then their bodies forget how to function involuntarily…and there is no cure. But now, far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, deep in the Marianas Trench, an heretofore unknown substance hailed as “ambrosia” has been discovered—a universal healer, from initial reports. It may just be the key to a universal cure. In order to study this phenomenon, a special research lab, the Trieste, has been built eight miles under the sea’s surface. But now the station is incommunicado, and it’s up to a brave few to descend through the lightless fathoms in hopes of unraveling the mysteries lurking at those crushing depths…and perhaps to encounter an evil blacker than anything one could possibly imagine.Part horror, part psychological nightmare, The Deep is a novel that fans of Stephen King and Clive Barker won’t want to miss—especially if you’re afraid of the dark.",,Canadian,,January 13th 2015,[],Paperback,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Canada', 'Apocalyptic']",,9781501101519,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418936575l/23946416.jpg,3.38,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Horror (2015)'],87.0,1.0,,23946416-the-deep,,,,,79.0,11253.0,400,,Simon & Schuster Canada,"['1826', '3507', '3609', '1690', '621']",,,[],,

In this eye-opening exposé, Davies uncovers an industry awash in corruption and bias. His findings include the story of a prestigious Sunday newspaper that allowed the CIA to plant fiction in its columns; the newsroom that routinely rejects stories about black people; the respected paper that hired a professional fraudster to set up a front company to entrap senior political figures; as well as a number of newspapers that pay cash bribes to bent detectives. His research also exposes a range of national stories that were in fact pseudo events manufactured by the public relations industry and global news stories that were fiction generated by a machinery of international propaganda. The degree to which the media industry has affected government policy and perverted popular belief is also addressed.

Nick Hornby,A Long Way Down,,English,,"In his eagerly awaited fourth novel, New York Times-bestselling author Nick Hornby mines the hearts and psyches of four lost souls who connect just when they've reached the end of the line. Meet Martin, JJ, Jess, and Maureen. Four people who come together on New Year's Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper's House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives. In four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances. Intense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Down is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life. What's your jumping-off point? MaureenWhy is it the biggest sin of all? All your life you're told that you'll be going to this marvelous place when you pass on. And the one thing you can do to get you there a bit quicker is something that stops you getting there at all. Oh, I can see that it's a kind of queue-jumping. But if someone jumps the queue at the post office, people tut. Or sometimes they say ""Excuse me, I was here first."" They don't say ""You will be consumed by hellfire for all eternity."" That would be a bit strong. MartinI'd spent the previous couple of months looking up suicides on the Internet, just out of curiosity. And nearly every single time, the coroner says the same thing: ""He took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed."" And then you read the story about the poor bastard: His wife was sleeping with his best friend, he'd lost his job, his daughter had been killed in a road accident some months before . . . Hello, Mr. Coroner? I'm sorry, but there's no disturbed mental balance here, my friend. I'd say he got it just right. JessI was at a party downstairs. It was a shit party, full of all these ancient crusties sitting on the floor drinking cider and smoking huge spliffs and listening to weirdo space-out reggae. At midnight, one of them clapped sarcastically, and a couple of others laughed, and that was it-Happy New Year to you, too. You could have turned up to that party as the happiest person in London, and you'd still have wanted to jump off the roof by five past twelve. And I wasn't the happiest person in London anyway. Obviously. JJNew Year's Eve was a night for sentimental losers. It was my own stupid fault. Of course there'd be a low-rent crowd up there. I should have picked a classier date-like March 28, when Virginia Woolf took her walk into the river, or November 25 (Nick Drake). If anybody had been on the roof on either of those nights, the chances are they would have been like-minded souls, rather than hopeless f*ck-ups who had somehow persuaded themselves that the end of a calendar year is in any way significant.",,,05/05/05,May 2nd 2006,"['Maureen', 'JJ', 'Martin Sharp', 'Jess Crichton']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Literature', 'Mental Health']",,9781594481932,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1467861525l/10073._SX318_.jpg,3.43,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2005)'],823.0,9.0,,10073.A_Long_Way_Down,,,,,84.0,80064.0,368,,Riverhead Books,"['11656', '26609', '29304', '9783', '2712']",,,[],,

Nick Hornby,How to Be Good,,,,"In Nick Hornby's How to Be Good, Katie Carr is certainly trying to be. That's why she became a GP. That's why she cares about Third World debt and homelessness, and struggles to raise her children with a conscience. It's also why she puts up with her husband David, the self-styled Angriest Man in Holloway. But one fateful day, she finds herself in a Leeds parking lot, having just slept with another man. What Katie doesn't yet realize is that her fall from grace is just the first step on a spiritual journey more torturous than the interstate at rush hour. Because, prompted by his wife's actions, David is about to stop being angry. He's about to become good--not politically correct, organic-food-eating good, but good in the fashion of the Gospels. And that's no easier in modern-day Holloway than it was in ancient Israel.  Hornby means us to take his title literally: How can we be good, and what does that mean? However, quite apart from demanding that his readers scrub their souls with the nearest available Brillo pad, he also mesmerizes us with that cocktail of wit and compassion that has become his trademark. The result is a multifaceted jewel of a book: a hilarious romp, a painstaking dissection of middle-class mores, and a powerfully sympathetic portrait of a marriage in its death throes. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as we watch David forcing his kids to give away their computers, drawing up schemes for the mass redistribution of wealth, and inviting his wife's most desolate patients round for a Sunday roast. But that's because How to Be Good manages to be both brutally truthful and full of hope. It won't outsell the Bible, but it's a lot funnier. --Matthew BaylisFrom Publishers WeeklyKate, a doctor, wife and mother, is in the midst of a difficult decision: whether to leave or stay with her bitter, sarcastic husband David (who proudly writes a local newspaper column called ""The Angriest Man in Holloway""). The long-term marriage has gone stale, but is it worth uprooting the children and the comfortable lifestyle? Then David meets a faith healer called Dr. Goodnews, and suddenly converts to an idealistic do-gooder: donating the children's computer to an orphanage, giving away the family's Sunday dinner to homeless people and inviting runaways to stay in the guest room (and convincing the neighbors to do likewise). Barber gives an outstanding performance as Kate, humorously conveying her mounting irritation at having her money and belongings donated to strangers, her guilt at not feeling more generous and her hilarious desire for revenge. Barber brilliantly portrays each eccentric character: hippie-ish Goodnews, crusading David, petulant children and, poignantly, the hesitant, halting Barmy Brian, a mentally deficient patient of Kate's who needs looking after. Barber's stellar performance turns a worthy novel into a must-listen event.

Nick Lane,"Power, Sex, Suicide",Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life,,Science,"Mitochondria are tiny structures located inside our cells that carry out the essential task of producing energy for the cell. They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

Nick Montfort,Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction,,English,,"A critical approach to interactive fiction, as literature and game.Interactive fiction--the best-known form of which is the text game or text adventure--has not received as much critical attention as have such other forms of electronic literature as hypertext fiction and the conversational programs known as chatterbots. Twisty Little Passages (the title refers to a maze in Adventure, the first interactive fiction) is the first book-length consideration of this form, examining it from gaming and literary perspectives. Nick Montfort, an interactive fiction author himself, offers both aficionados and first-time users a way to approach interactive fiction that will lead to a more pleasurable and meaningful experience of it.Twisty Little Passages looks at interactive fiction beginning with its most important literary ancestor, the riddle. Montfort then discusses Adventure and its precursors (including the I Ching and Dungeons and Dragons), and follows this with an examination of mainframe text games developed in response, focusing on the most influential work of that era, Zork. He then considers the introduction of commercial interactive fiction for home computers, particularly that produced by Infocom. Commercial works inspired an independent reaction, and Montfort describes the emergence of independent creators and the development of an online interactive fiction community in the 1990s. Finally, he considers the influence of interactive fiction on other literary and gaming forms. With Twisty Little Passages, Nick Montfort places interactive fiction in its computational and literary contexts, opening up this still-developing form to new consideration.",,,11/06/03,February 11th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Games', 'Writing', 'Video Games', 'Technology', 'Gaming', 'History', 'Game Design', 'Computer Science', 'Computers']",,9780262633185,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920819l/191437.jpg,3.77,[],84.0,1.0,,191437.Twisty_Little_Passages,,,,,91.0,289.0,286,,MIT Press,"['62', '129', '73', '20', '5']",,,[],,

Series, featuring the Newmans, that can easily be read as a standalone novel!  ***  Sometimes, the hardest part of becoming a success is keeping a straight face...  Jamie & Laura Newman have recently become quite the successful - and mildly wealthy - couple, thanks to the fact they've managed to write a series of popular romantic comedies together. This has come as a complete surprise to the hapless pair, and is - needless to say - a turn of events neither is in the slightest bit equipped to deal with.  They get invited to posh events where they feel endlessly out of place, have long lost relatives turn up out of the blue, raise an aspiring diva for a daughter, and go on holiday to exotic places they really have no place being. It's enough to make anyone crawl under the nearest rock.  If you're Jamie, you also get to turn 40 - and there's not a damn thing he can do to stop it. As for Laura, well let's say that just because you can afford to purchase expensive beauty products, it doesn't necessarily mean that you should.  ‘Money can't buy you happiness’ as the old saying goes. Nor can it stop the Newmans being the Newmans, with all their quirks, eccentricities - and the uncanny ability to embarrass themselves in public at the drop of a hat.  LOVE...

Nick Vujicic,Life Without Limits,,English,,"Life Without Limits is an inspiring book by an extraordinary man. Born without arms or legs, Nick Vujicic overcame his disability to live not just independently but a rich, fulfilling life, becoming a model for anyone seeking true happiness. Now an internationally successful motivational speaker, his central message is that the most important goal for anyone is to find their life’s purpose despite whatever difficulties or seemingly impossible odds stand in their way. Nick tells the story of his physical disabilities and the emotional battle he endured trying to deal with them as a child, a teen, and a young adult. “For the longest, loneliest time, I wondered if there was anyone on earth like me, and whether there was any purpose to my life other than pain and humiliation.” He shares how his faith in God has been his central source of strength and explains that once he found his own sense of purpose—inspiring others to make their lives and the world better—he found the confidence to build a rewarding and productive life without limits. Nick offers practical advice for realizing a life of fulfillment and happiness by building trust in others, developing supportive relationships, and gaining strength for the journey. He encourages the reader by showing how he learned to accept what he could not control and focus instead on what he could. “I do believe my life has no limits! I want you to feel the same way about your life, no matter what your challenges may be. As we begin our journey together, please take a moment to think about any limitations you’ve placed on your life or that you’ve allowed others to place on it.

Nick Webb,Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams,,English,,"It all started when Douglas Adams demolished planet Earth in order to make way for an intergalactic expressway–and then invited everyone to thumb a ride on a comical cosmic road trip with the likes of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the other daft denizens of deep space immortalized in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book “trilogy” that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you’ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you’ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python’s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic; and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat–while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration– a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject’s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.From the Hardcover edition.",,,10/06/03,December 27th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Unfinished', 'Own', 'History']",,9780345476517,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348546806l/362.jpg,4.14,[],92.0,1.0,,362.Wish_You_Were_Here,,,,,95.0,2813.0,368,,Del Rey,"['1221', '934', '520', '99', '39']",,,[],,

Nicki Elson (Goodreads Author),Three Daves,,English,,"This book has been rewritten as three novellas, one for each Dave. You can read the details and reasoning behind the rewrite here: Why did I re-write Three Daves?""Find the new novellas here: Three Daves 2.0Jennifer Whitney was the last American virgin. At least that’s what she felt like in 1986 as she began her sophomore year at Central Illinois University. She was proud of her decision to wait for the right guy, and yet she was getting restless. It seemed like everyone around her was doing it... and having fun doing it, too. She didn’t want to become the campus slut or anything, but surely there was a difference between a trashy skank and a nice girl with a little experience. Perhaps it was time to stop relying on fate to guide her and instead take matters into her own hands.

Nicki Pau Preto (Goodreads Author),Crown of Feathers,,English,,"
  I had a sister, once…
In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders—legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire—until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.
  I promised her the throne would not come between us.
Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders—even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.
  But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled.
Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.
  Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken.

She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide. Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future.

Nicola Griffith (Goodreads Author),Hild,,English,,"Hild is born into a world in transition. In seventh-century Britain, small kingdoms are merging, usually violently. A new religion is coming ashore; the old gods’ priests are worrying. Edwin of Northumbria plots to become overking of the Angles, ruthlessly using every tool at his disposal: blood, bribery, belief.Hild is the king’s youngest niece. She has the powerful curiosity of a bright child, a will of adamant, and a way of seeing the world—of studying nature, of matching cause with effect, of observing human nature and predicting what will happen next—that can seem uncanny, even supernatural, to those around her. She establishes herself as the king’s seer. And she is indispensable—until she should ever lead the king astray. The stakes are life and death: for Hild, her family, her loved ones, and the increasing numbers who seek the protection of the strange girl who can read the world and see the future.Hild is a young woman at the heart of the violence, subtlety, and mysticism of the early medieval age—all of it brilliantly and accurately evoked by Nicola Griffith’s luminous prose. Recalling such feats of historical fiction as Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall and Sigrid Undset’s Kristin Lavransdatter, Hild brings a beautiful, brutal world—and one of its most fascinating, pivotal figures, the girl who would become St. Hilda of Whitby—to vivid, absorbing life.",Light of the World #1,,January 1st 2013,November 12th 2013,"['Hild of Whitby', 'Edwin of Deira']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'British Literature', 'Young Adult', 'Adult']",,9780374280871,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375931640l/17332243.jpg,3.77,"['Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2013)', 'John W.

Nicolas Tredell,William Faulkner,The Sound and the Fury ; As I Lay Dying,,Literary Criticism,"This book explores the puzzling phenomenon of new veiling practices among lower middle class women in Cairo, Egypt. Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women's protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.",,,,1999.0,,,,023112189X,9780231121897,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3_DKH4sX-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.96,,,,,,,,,,,,192.0,,,,4.0,,,,

Nicolas Vanier,Das Schneekind: Eine Familie unterwegs durch die Schneewüsten Kanadas,,,,"Titelheldin der abenteuerlichen Erzählung Das Schneekind ist Montaine Vanier, die 18 Monate alte Tochter des Autors. Im zarten Kleinkindalter begleitete sie ihr Eltern ins ewige Eis des Nordens. Ihr Vater, Nicolas Vanier, war schon immer fasziniert von weiten Schneelandschaften: Er bereiste Lappland, Sibirien, Alaska und Kanada und wurde mit seiner ersten Schlittenhundfahrt quer über den amerikanischen Kontinent -- der weißen Odyssee -- weltbekannt. So erfüllte sich für ihn ein Traum, als der lang gehegte Plan, sich für ein ganzes Jahr in die endlos weite Einsamkeit zurückzuziehen, tatsächlich Gestalt annimmt. Dass das Familienabenteuer dann keineswegs so glatt abläuft, wie sich die beiden das vorgestellt hatten, tröstet all jene, die an derart abenteuerliche Unternehmungen gar nicht zu denken wagen. Klirrende Dauerkälte und die Mückenschwärme des kurzen Polarsommers, den die Vaniers nutzen, um ein Blockhaus zu bauen, die mühsame Jagd nach Schneeziegen, die Gefahren der Schneeschmelze, hungrige Grislibären und Temperaturen um -40 Grad Celsius, pfeifende Winterstürme und tückisches Packeis machen das Leben im hohen Norden hart: Bis an die Grenzen der eigenen Kraft muss das Paar gehen, um der Natur Nahrung, Wärme und ein Auskommen abzutrotzen. Dennoch überwiegen die Momente des Glücks bei der Suche nach dem Einswerden mit der Natur, kommt eine Klarheit und Poesie zum Vorschein, die in der Zivilisation kaum so intensiv zu empfinden ist. So wundert es nicht, dass auch für die kleine Montaine der Ausflug in die Kälte eine prägende Erfahrung wird, an der der Leser dank der ebenso liebevollen wie aufmerksamen Beobachtung der Eltern Anteil nimmt. Eine Reihe stimmungsvoller Fotos vermittelt Impressionen vom Familienleben in der Wildnis. Übrigens: Nicolas Vanier, der wie sein Vorbild Jack London eine Mischung aus Abenteurer und Schriftsteller sein möchte, lebt heute als Züchter von Schlittenhunden und Publizist in Frankreich und Kanada und bietet abenteuerliche Touren in den Norden des Québec an. --Dorothea Fröhlich",,,01/24/00,November 1st 2002,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'German Literature']",,9783492237208,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1267360344l/2906337.jpg,4.22,[],96.0,1.0,,2906337-das-schneekind,,,,,96.0,124.0,351,,Piper Taschenbuch,"['54', '49', '16', '4', '1']",,,[],,

Nicole Baart (Goodreads Author),Little Broken Things,,English,,"An engrossing and suspenseful novel for fans of Liane Moriarty and Amy Hatvany about an affluent suburban family whose carefully constructed facade starts to come apart with the unexpected arrival of an endangered young girl.I have something for you. When Quinn Cruz receives that cryptic text message from her older sister Nora, she doesn’t think much of it. They haven’t seen each other in nearly a year and thanks to Nora’s fierce aloofness, their relationship consists mostly of infrequent phone calls and an occasional email or text. But when a haunted Nora shows up at the lake near Quinn's house just hours later, a chain reaction is set into motion that will change both of their lives forever. Nora’s “something” is more shocking than Quinn could have ever imagined: a little girl, cowering, wide-eyed, and tight-lipped. Nora hands her over to Quinn with instructions to keep her safe, and not to utter a word about the child to anyone, especially not their buttoned-up mother who seems determined to pretend everything is perfect. But before Quinn can ask even one of the million questions swirling around her head, Nora disappears, and Quinn finds herself the unlikely caretaker of a girl introduced simply as Lucy. While Quinn struggles to honor her sister’s desperate request and care for the lost, scared Lucy, she fears that Nora may have gotten involved in something way over her head—something that will threaten them all. But Quinn’s worries are nothing compared to the firestorm that Nora is facing.

When wild-child, and south Florida escapee, Danielle Martino finds herself curled in a ball on the cold tile floors of her filthy rank bathroom in the tiny studio she rents with her fiancé and partner-in-crime, she knows it's time to quit abusing heroin. Severely impaired from shooting a bad batch of black tar heroin, and already partially blind from the infection that the muddy poison has caused, she is forced to hitch a greyhound bus to New York City, and to abandon her care-free, American-bohemian, drug infested life-style.Hailed everywhere as a beautiful, unique, honest, raw and poetic account of recovery, Addictarium takes readers on a compelling journey through the life and eyes of the narrator; a creative, nomadic, deep--but, incidentally broken--young woman, and underlines the contributing factors to what it's really like to suffer from addiction. With magnificent candor--and sometimes emotionally crippling descriptions--we witness Danielle's fight towards recovery from more than just heroin, as Addictarium brings the readers on a fascinating and harrowing, brutal tale of a young women's recovery from total and mass self-destruction. --Addictarium highlights in the starkest of lights, why it is so difficult for addicts to receive the recovery they seek, when they finally do decide to put the drug down.",,,,September 1st 2016,[],ebook,[],,9781365606625,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472730428l/31817085._SX318_.jpg,4.29,[],100.0,1.0,,31817085-addictarium,,,,,96.0,95.0,325,,The Book House of Seviles & Nicole Settimi,"['54', '22', '15', '1', '3']",,,[],,

Nicole Krauss,Forest Dark,,English,,"Jules Epstein, a man whose drive, avidity, and outsized personality have, for sixty-eight years, been a force to be reckoned with, is undergoing a metamorphosis. In the wake of his parents’ deaths, his divorce from his wife of more than thirty years, and his retirement from the New York legal firm where he was a partner, he’s felt an irresistible need to give away his possessions, alarming his children and perplexing the executor of his estate. With the last of his wealth, he travels to Israel, with a nebulous plan to do something to honor his parents. In Tel Aviv, he is sidetracked by a charismatic American rabbi planning a reunion for the descendants of King David who insists that Epstein is part of that storied dynastic line. He also meets the rabbi’s beautiful daughter who convinces Epstein to become involved in her own project—a film about the life of David being shot in the desert—with life-changing consequences.But Epstein isn’t the only seeker embarking on a metaphysical journey that dissolves his sense of self, place, and history. Leaving her family in Brooklyn, a young, well-known novelist arrives at the Tel Aviv Hilton where she has stayed every year since birth. Troubled by writer’s block and a failing marriage, she hopes that the hotel can unlock a dimension of reality—and her own perception of life—that has been closed off to her. But when she meets a retired literature professor who proposes a project she can’t turn down, she’s drawn into a mystery that alters her life in ways she could never have imagined.Bursting with life and humor, Forest Dark is a profound, mesmerizing novel of metamorphosis and self-realization—of looking beyond all that is visible towards the infinite.",,,08/30/17,September 12th 2017,['Jules Epstein'],ebook,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'Israel', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Unfinished', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'Audiobook']",,9780062431011,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490293616l/33544874._SY475_.jpg,3.08,[],97.0,1.0,,33544874-forest-dark,,,,,71.0,5867.0,304,,Harper,"['576', '1377', '2238', '1277', '399']",,,"['Tel Aviv (Israel)', 'Israel']",,

"Nidhal Guessoum (Goodreads Author), Alessia Weil (Traduction)",Réconcilier l'islam et la science moderne: l'esprit d'Averroès,,,,"
  In secular Europe, the veracity of modern science is almost always taken for granted. Whether they think of the evolutionary proofs of Darwin or of spectacular investigation into the boundaries of physics conducted by CERN's Large Hadron Collider, most people assume that scientific enquiry goes to the heart of fundamental truths about the universe. Yet elsewhere, science is under siege. In the USA, Christian fundamentalists contest whether evolution should be taught in schools at all. And in Muslim countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Pakistan and Malaysia, a mere 15% of those recently surveyed believed Darwin's theory to be ""true"" or ""probably true."" This thoughtful and passionately argued book contends absolutely to the contrary: not only that evolutionary theory does not contradict core Muslim beliefs, but that many scholars, from Islam's golden age to the present, adopted a worldview that accepted evolution as a given. Guessoum suggests that the Islamic world, just like the Christian, needs to take scientific questions -- quantum questions -- with the utmost seriousness if it is to recover its true heritage and integrity. In its application of a specifically Muslim perspective to important topics like cosmology, divine action and evolution, the book makes a vital contribution to debate in the disputed field of ""science and religion.""

Nigel Warburton,A Little History of Philosophy,,English,,"Philosophy begins with questions about the nature of reality and how we should live. These were the concerns of Socrates, who spent his days in the ancient Athenian marketplace asking awkward questions, disconcerting the people he met by showing them how little they genuinely understood.

He provides interesting and often quirky stories of the lives and deaths of thought-provoking philosophers from Socrates, who chose to die by hemlock poisoning rather than live on without the freedom to think for himself, to Peter Singer, who asks the disquieting philosophical and ethical questions that haunt our own times.Warburton not only makes philosophy accessible, he offers inspiration to think, argue, reason, and ask in the tradition of Socrates.

But it was on a trip to India at the age of eight that her mathematical powers acquired their almost supernatural significance.At fourteen Rumi is firmly set on the path of a gifted child, speeding headlong towards Oxford University. As her father sees it, discipline is everything if the family is to have any hope of making its mark on its adoptive country. However, as Rumi gets older and the family’s stark isolation intensifies, numbers start to lose their magic for the young teenager: she abandons the rigid timetable of her afternoons and replaces equations with rampant spice abuse. As her longing for love and her parents’ will to succeed deepen so too does the rift between generations.Gifted captures brilliantly the battle to come of age in an emotional and comic hinterland, where histories, arithmetic and cumin seeds all play a part. In a voice that is by turns very funny and fiercely acute Lalwani vividly brings to life a young family’s search for recognition and how that search can break a family apart.

Nikki Giovanni,The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni,1968-1998,,Poetry,"This omnibus covers Nikki Giovanni's complete work of poetry from 1967–1983. THE COLLECTED POETRY OF NIKKI GIOVANNI will include the complete volumes of five adult books of poetry: Black Feeling Black Talk/Black Judgement, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day, and Those Who Ride the Night Winds. Nikki self–published her first book Black Feeling, Black Talk/BlackJudgement in 1969, selling 10,000 copies; William Morrow published in 1970. Know for its iconic revolutionary phrases, it is heralded as one of the most important volumes of modern African–American poetry and is considered the seminal volume of Nikki's body of work. My House (Morrow 1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosphy––This is Giovanni's first foray into the autobiographical. In The Women and the Men (Morrow 1975), Nikki displays her compassion for the people, things and places she has encountered––She reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (Morrow 1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective of all Giovanni's collections. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s––when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated.

"Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Michael R. Katz (Translator)",What Is to Be Done?,,English,,"""No work in modern literature, with the possible exception of Uncle Tom's Cabin, can compete with What Is to Be Done? in its effect on human lives and its power to make history. For Chernyshevsky's novel, far more than Marx's Capital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution.""--Joseph Frank, The Southern ReviewAlmost from the moment of its publication in 1863, Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done?, had a profound impact on the course of Russian literature and politics. The idealized image it offered of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals transforming society by means of scientific knowledge served as a model of inspiration for Russia's revolutionary intelligentsia. On the one hand, the novel's condemnation of moderate reform helped to bring about the irrevocable break between radical intellectuals and liberal reformers; on the other, Chernyshevsky's socialist vision polarized conservatives' opposition to institutional reform. Lenin himself called Chernyshevsky ""the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx""; and the controversy surrounding What Is to Be Done? exacerbated the conflicts that eventually led to the Russian Revolution.Michael R. Katz's readable and compelling translation is now the definitive unabridged English-language version, brilliantly capturing the extraordinary qualities of the original. William G. Wagner has provided full annotations to Chernyshevsky's allusions and references and to the, sources of his ideas, and has appended a critical bibliography. An introduction by Katz and Wagner places the novel in the context of nineteenth-century Russian social, political, and intellectual history and literature, and explores its importance for several generations of Russian radicals.",,,10/30/63,January 1st 1989,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Novels', '19th Century', 'Russian History']",,9780801495472,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348353496l/178196.jpg,3.44,[],95.0,1.0,,178196.What_Is_to_Be_Done_,,,,,78.0,2029.0,445,,Cornell University Press,"['502', '513', '569', '263', '182']",,,[],,

He was never accepted by the Russian public as being completely Russian in his thinking and political ideology, and indeed he was not. Gogol's Ukrainian upbringing is most evident in his early works which draw heavily from Ukrainian culture and folk history. His later writing was more subversive, openly satirizing the corruption he saw rampant throughout Russia's empire. Gogol was homosexual. At age seventeen he wrote passionate letters to a friend who, being two years older, had graduated before Gogol, leaving him bereft. Gogol eventually exiled himself from Russia, living in Rome. It was here that he enjoyed at least one mutual love affair with a man, but his lover died within a year of their meeting. Two years later Gogol fell in love with the poet Nikolai Yazykov and penned love letters to him, but his efforts came to nothing. Gogol died in Moscow and was buried at Davilov Monastery. His last words were placed on his tombstone: ""And I shall laugh my bitter laugh.""

All of Gogol's most memorable creations are here: the minor official who misplaces his nose, the downtrodden clerk whose life is changed by the acquisition of a splendid new overcoat, the wily madman who becomes convinced that a dog can tell him everything he needs to know.These fantastic, comic, utterly Russian characters have dazzled generations of readers and had a profound influence on writers such as Dostoevsky and Nabokov.

Zorba, a Greek working man, is a larger-than-life character, energetic and unpredictable. He accompanies the unnamed narrator to Crete to work in the narrator’s lignite mine, and the pair develops a singular relationship. The two men couldn’t be further apart: The narrator is cerebral, modest, and reserved; Zorba is unfettered, spirited, and beyond the reins of civility. Over the course of their journey, he becomes the narrator’s greatest friend and inspiration and helps him to appreciate the joy of living.Zorba has been acclaimed as one of the most remarkable figures in literature; he is a character in the great tradition of Sinbad the Sailor, Falstaff, and Sancho Panza. He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he’s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love. Zorba the Greek explores the beauty and pain of existence, inviting readers to reevaluate the most important aspects of their lives and live to the fullest.",,,10/28/46,April 3rd 2000,"['unnamed narrator', 'Alexis Zorba', 'Widow', 'Madame Hortense', 'Mimithos']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Greece', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Unfinished']",,9780571203130,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542885673l/53639._SY475_.jpg,4.07,['Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger for Roman (1954)'],5950.0,75.0,,53639.Zorba_the_Greek,,,,,92.0,37504.0,335,,Faber and Faber,"['15960', '12206', '6286', '2088', '964']",,,['Crete (Greece)'],,

Bien (Translator)",The Last Temptation of Christ,,English,,"The internationally renowned novel about the life and death of Jesus Christ.Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ’s Passion. This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other—subject to fear, doubt, and pain.  In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God’s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ’s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.  “Spiritual dynamite.” —San Francisco Chronicle  “A searing, soaring, shocking novel.” —Time ",,,10/28/55,March 1st 1998,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Greece', 'Christianity', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality']",,9780684852560,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481512264l/8737._SY475_.jpg,4.17,[],3626.0,51.0,,8737.The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ,,,,,94.0,12131.0,506,,Simon Schuster,"['5463', '4131', '1861', '474', '202']",,,[],,

Nina Angelo,"Don't Cry, Dance: A memoir of war, love and forgiveness",,,,"Don’t Cry, Dance is a memoir spanning four generations - through war, horror and loss, to peace, calm and love - from Auschwitz-Birkenow to Paris, London, Athens and ultimately to Sydney, Australia.  Janka was a Polish Jewish girl, and Alberto, a Spanish Greek Jewish man. This tale reveals how love and hearts of kindness came out of the horrors of the concentration camps.  In 1949, they came to Australia, bringing two cultures, 13 languages and their toddler Nina, to forge a new beginning. These two people would never have met and fallen in love, if they hadn’t survived the attempted extermination of a race in the death chambers of Europe. They knew and taught their children, that we cannot move on without forgiveness.  Nina always knew she came from their legacy of resilience, generosity, hospitality, love and their acceptance of all people. As a storyteller and community artist, it was time for her to add her story to theirs and weave a lasting memory and tale of forgiveness for future generations.

Although prey to night terrors, she is adept at smoothing the disorder of reality into controlled prose. Interweaving memory, conversation, and reflection, Walking Naked telescopes the whole of Laura's life—childhood, marriages, triumphs, and disappointments—into a day in which the past and the present converge. It begins with a game of tennis played for duty rather than amusement and progresses, via an afternoon party of old friends and jaded emotions, to a bewildering visit to Laura's son, who is imprisoned on a drugs charge. At its close, the possibility of death within the family brings unresolved conflicts to center stage, and Laura strips herself of the posturing and self-deceit with which she has cloaked her vulnerability.

Nina Björk,Under det rosa täcket,,Swedish,,"Var står den svenska feminismen idag och vart är den på väg? När vi allt oftare hör tongångar om kvinnans särart, om kvinnors rätt att vara annorlunda män, måste vi åter ställa den grundläggade frågan: vad är kvinnlighet? Genom att läsa förföriska kvinnomagasin, feministiska biologer, hyllare av moderskapet, en roman av Virginia Woolf, aggressiva ninjafeminister i litteratur och på film och genom att läsa skildringen av Simone de Beauvoirs liv följer Nina Björk kvinnligheten som en skapelseberättelse. Här finns även en summering av den kvoteringsdebatt som är aktuell i Sverige. Vad avslöjar den om vår patriarkala demokratis grunder?Nina Björk, frilansjournalist och litteraturvetare, har skrivit ett inlägg i den feministiska debatten. Hon talar för en feminism som inte gör kvinnan till en utopi, som inte ger henne en ''naturlig'' identitet - utan som istället kämpar för en frigörelse från fasta könsidentiteter.''Under det rosa täcket'' väckte en enorm uppmärksamhet när den utkom första gången 1996 och fick snabbt kultstatus, inte minst bland unga tjejer.

Torn from her native New York City and dumped in the land of cookie-cutter preps, Candice is resigned to accept her posh, dull fate. Nothing ever happens in Swoon, Connecticut...until Dice's perfect, privileged cousin Penelope nearly dies in a fall from an old tree, and her spirit intertwines with that of a ghost. His name? Sinclair Youngblood Powers. His mission? Revenge. And while Pen is oblivious to the possession, Dice is all too aware of Sin.

Nina Willner (Goodreads Author),Forty Autumns: A Family's Story of Courage and Survival on Both Sides of the Berlin Wall,,English,,"In this illuminating and deeply moving memoir, a former American military intelligence officer goes beyond traditional Cold War espionage tales to tell the true story of her family—of five women separated by the Iron Curtain for more than forty years, and their miraculous reunion after the fall of the Berlin Wall.Forty Autumns makes visceral the pain and longing of one family forced to live apart in a world divided by two. At twenty, Hanna escaped from East to West Germany. But the price of freedom—leaving behind her parents, eight siblings, and family home—was heartbreaking. Uprooted, Hanna eventually moved to America, where she settled down with her husband and had children of her own.Growing up near Washington, D.C., Hanna’s daughter, Nina Willner became the first female Army Intelligence Officer to lead sensitive intelligence operations in East Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Though only a few miles separated American Nina and her German relatives—grandmother Oma, Aunt Heidi, and cousin, Cordula, a member of the East German Olympic training team—a bitter political war kept them apart.In Forty Autumns, Nina recounts her family’s story—five ordinary lives buffeted by circumstances beyond their control. She takes us deep into the tumultuous and terrifying world of East Germany under Communist rule, revealing both the cruel reality her relatives endured and her own experiences as an intelligence officer, running secret operations behind the Berlin Wall that put her life at risk.A personal look at a tenuous era that divided a city and a nation, and continues to haunt us, Forty Autumns is an intimate and beautifully written story of courage, resilience, and love—of five women whose spirits could not be broken, and who fought to preserve what matters most: family.Forty Autumns is illustrated with dozens of black-and-white and color photographs.",,,,October 4th 2016,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Germany', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'World War II']",,9780062410337,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465617304l/28510777.jpg,4.35,[],199.0,2.0,,28510777-forty-autumns,,,,,99.0,5753.0,416,,William Morrow,"['2782', '2317', '569', '66', '19']",,,"['Berlin (Germany)', 'East Germany']",,

After a reunion with an old friend goes wrong in a Long Island night club, Kasheef is forced to protect himself by any means necessary. The only problem is that prying eyes see everything. Those eyes belong to Alija Bell. After walking in on a situation she was never meant to see, she runs; but Kasheef sees her face, and he tells her that it's best for her to get temporary amnesia.  Afraid for her life and the safety of her daughter, she keeps her mouth shut--but when a tape of the murder surfaces, the only face that's visible is Alija's.

Noah Gordon,The Last Jew,A Novel of The Spanish Inquisition,,Fiction,"In the year 1492, the Inquisition has all of Spain in its grip. After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew. On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story.

Noah Gordon,Shaman,,English,,"
  Robert Jeremy Cole, the legendary doctor and hero of The Physician, left an enduring legacy. From the 11th century on, the eldest son in each generation of the Cole family has borne the same first name and middle initial and many of these men have followed the medical profession. A few have been blessed with their ancestor's diagnostic skill and the ""sixth sense"" they call The Gift, the ability to know instinctively when death is impending. The tragedy of Rob J.'s life is the deafness of his son, Robert Jefferson Cole, who is called Shaman by everyone who knows him. Shaman's life is difficult. First, he must learn to speak so that he can take his place in the hearing world, and then he must fight against the prejudices of a society where physical differences matter. As Shaman struggles to achieve his identity, the Coles, along with the rest of America, are drawn into the conflict between the North and the South.

Noah Hawley (Goodreads Author),The Good Father,,English,,"An intense, psychological novel about one doctor's suspense-filled quest to unlock the mind of a suspected political assassin: his twenty-year old son.   As the Chief of Rheumatology at Columbia Presbyterian, Dr. Paul Allen's specialty is diagnosing patients with conflicting symptoms, patients other doctors have given up on. He lives a contented life in Westport with his second wife and their twin sons—hard won after a failed marriage earlier in his career that produced a son named Daniel. In the harrowing opening scene of this provocative and affecting novel, Dr. Allen is home with his family when a televised news report announces that the Democratic candidate for president has been shot at a rally, and Daniel is caught on video as the assassin.        Daniel Allen has always been a good kid—a decent student, popular—but, as a child of divorce, used to shuttling back and forth between parents, he is also something of a drifter. Which may be why, at the age of nineteen, he quietly drops out of Vassar and begins an aimless journey across the United States, during which he sheds his former skin and eventually even changes his name to Carter Allen Cash.      Told alternately from the point of view of the guilt-ridden, determined father and his meandering, ruminative son, The Good Father is a powerfully emotional page-turner that keeps one guessing until the very end.

Noah Levine,Dharma Punx: A Memoir,,English,,"Fueled by the music of revolution, anger, fear, and despair, we dyed our hair or shaved our heads ... Eating acid like it was candy and chasing speed with cheap vodka, smoking truckloads of weed, all in a vain attempt to get numb and stay numb.This is the story of a young man and a generation of angry youths who rebelled against their parents and the unfulfilled promise of the sixties. As with many self-destructive kids, Noah Levine's search for meaning led him first to punk rock, drugs, drinking, and dissatisfaction. But the search didn't end there. Having clearly seen the uselessness of drugs and violence, Noah looked for positive ways to channel his rebellion against what he saw as the lies of society. Fueled by his anger at so much injustice and suffering, Levine now uses that energy and the practice of Buddhism to awaken his natural wisdom and compassion.While Levine comes to embrace the same spiritual tradition as his father, bestselling author Stephen Levine, he finds his most authentic expression in connecting the seemingly opposed worlds of punk and Buddhism. As Noah Levine delved deeper into Buddhism, he chose not to reject the punk scene, instead integrating the two worlds as a catalyst for transformation. Ultimately, this is an inspiring story about maturing, and how a hostile and lost generation is finally finding its footing. This provocative report takes us deep inside the punk scene and moves from anger, rebellion, and self-destruction, to health, service to others, and genuine spiritual growth.",,,10/29/03,May 4th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Buddhism', 'Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Punk', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780060008956,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348949077l/128116.jpg,3.78,[],100.0,1.0,,128116.Dharma_Punx,,,,,89.0,3936.0,272,,HarperOne,"['1162', '1311', '1016', '324', '123']",,,[],,

Noam Chomsky,What Kind of Creatures Are We?,,,,"Noam Chomsky is widely known and deeply admired for being the founder of modern linguistics, one of the founders of the field of cognitive science, and perhaps the most avidly read political theorist and commentator of our time. In these lectures, he presents a lifetime of philosophical reflection on all three of these areas of research, to which he has contributed for over half a century.In clear, precise, and nontechnical language, Chomsky elaborates on fifty years of scientific development in the study of language, sketching how his own work has implications for the origins of language, the close relations that language bears to thought, and its eventual biological basis. He expounds and criticizes many alternative theories, such as those that emphasize the social, the communicative, and the referential aspects of language. Chomsky reviews how new discoveries about language overcome what seemed to be highly problematic assumptions in the past. He also investigates the apparent scope and limits of human cognitive capacities and what the human mind can seriously investigate, in the light of history of science and philosophical reflection and current understanding. Moving from language and mind to society and politics, he concludes with a searching exploration and philosophical defense of a position he describes as ""libertarian socialism,"" tracing its links to anarchism and the ideas of John Dewey and even to the ideas of Marx and Mill, demonstrating its conceptual growth out of our historical past and urgent relation to matters of the present.",,,,December 15th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Linguistics', 'Politics', 'Language', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Essays', 'Audiobook']",,9780231175968,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444892866l/26263022.jpg,3.73,[],100.0,1.0,,26263022-what-kind-of-creatures-are-we,,,,,89.0,696.0,200,,Columbia University Press,"['169', '264', '187', '61', '15']",,,[],,

World-renowned intellectual Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this perilous moment and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species.With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky tracks the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of ""full spectrum dominance"" and vividly lays out how the most recent manifestations of the politics of global control-from unilateralism to the dismantling of international agreements to state terrorism-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our existence.

Noam Chomsky,Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy,,English,,"
  
    
      ""It's hard to imagine any American reading this book and not seeing his country in a new, and deeply troubling, light.""--The New York Times Book Review
    
    The United States has repeatedly asserted its right to intervene militarily against ""failed states"" around the globe. In this much-anticipated follow-up to his international bestseller Hegemony or Survival, Noam Chomsky turns the tables, showing how the United States itself shares features with other failed states--suffering from a severe ""democratic deficit,"" eschewing domestic and international law, and adopting policies that increasingly endanger its own citizens and the world. Exploring the latest developments in U.S. foreign and domestic policy, Chomsky reveals Washington's plans to further militarize the planet, greatly increasing the risks of nuclear war. He also assesses the dangerous consequences of the occupation of Iraq; documents Washington's self-exemption from international norms, including the Geneva conventions and the Kyoto Protocol; and examines how the U.S. electoral system is designed to eliminate genuine political alternatives, impeding any meaningful democracy. 
    Forceful, lucid, and meticulously documented, Failed States offers a comprehensive analysis of a global superpower that has long claimed the right to reshape other nations while its own democratic institutions are in severe crisis. Systematically dismantling the United States' pretense of being the world's arbiter of democracy, Failed States is Chomsky's most focused--and urgent--critique to date.

In 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and at a time of great political and social instability, two of the world's leading intellectuals, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, were invited by Dutch philosopher Fons Edlers to debate an age-old question: is there such a thing as ""innate"" human nature independent of our experiences and external influences? The resulting dialogue is one of the most original, provocative, and spontaneous exchanges to have occurred between contemporary philosophers, and above all serves as a concise introduction to their basic theories. What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics. In addition to the debate itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault scholar John Rajchman and includes additional text by Noam Chomsky.",,,11/06/74,September 1st 2006,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Theory', 'Linguistics', 'Political Science', 'Language']",,9781595581341,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331453083l/12614.jpg,3.94,[],64.0,1.0,,12614.The_Chomsky_Foucault_Debate,,,,,94.0,2401.0,213,,The New Press,"['727', '979', '548', '118', '29']",,,[],,

Now, in Understanding Power, Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel have assembled the best of Chomsky's recent talks on the past, present, and future of the politics of power. In a series of enlightening and wide-ranging discussions, all published here for the first time, Chomsky radically reinterprets the events of the past three decades, covering topics from foreign policy during Vietnam to the decline of welfare under the Clinton administration. And as he elucidates the connection between America's imperialistic foreign policy and the decline of domestic social services, Chomsky also discerns the necessary steps to take toward social change. With an eye to political activism and the media's role in popular struggle, as well as U.S. foreign and domestic policy, Understanding Power offers a sweeping critique of the world around us and is definitive Chomsky.

Set against the backdrop of the Meiji Restoration, it tells the saga of Himura Kenshin, once an assassin of ferocious power, now a humble rurouni, a wandering swordsman fighting to protect the honor of those in need. A hundred and fifty years ago in Kyoto, amid the flames of revolution, there arose a warrior, an assassin of such ferocious power he was given the title Hitokiri: Manslayer. With his bloodstained blade, Hitokiri Battosai helped close the turbulent Bakumatsu period and end the reign of the shoguns, slashing open the way toward the progressive Meiji Era.  Then he vanished, and with the flow of years became legend. In the 11th year of Meiji, in the middle of Tokyo, the tale begins. Himura Kenshin, a humble rurouni, or wandering swordsman, comes to the aid of Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman struggling to defend her father's school of swordsmanship against attacks by the infamous Hitokiri Battosai. But neither Kenshin nor Battosai are quite what they seem...",Rurouni Kenshin #1,,09/02/94,December 23rd 2003,"['Kenshin ""Battosai"" Himura', 'Kaoru Kamiya', 'Yahiko Myojin', 'Kihei Hiruma', 'Gohei Hiruma', 'Sanosuke Sagara']",Paperback,"['Manga', 'Historical Fiction', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Comics Manga', 'Fantasy', 'Shonen']",,9781591162209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388273758l/294963.jpg,4.32,[],155.0,2.0,,294963.Rurouni_Kenshin_Volume_01,,,,,95.0,42290.0,201,,VIZ Media LLC,"['23978', '10782', '5422', '1331', '777']",,,['Tokyo (Japan)'],,

Things changed when I was 11, a lame tiger who owned a stationery shop gave me the keys to his stock room, I would roll around in acrylic and oil pastels in reverie, licking canvases and tucking coloured pencils into my wild hair. It was here I learned how to draw and paint well enough to be accepted into Croyden Art College.

Noel Streatfeild,Apple Bough,,English,,"The Forums (David and Polly, and the children Myra, Sebastian, Wolfgang and Ethel) live in a house called Apple Bough, and are a very musical family. David is a pianist, and considered one of the best accompanists in the country. Polly had been training to be a professional singer before her marriage: after her marriage she gave up training, and became an artist.All of the children can play the piano nicely, but Myra, Wolfgang and Ethel are ""born amateurs"". Sebastian plays remarkably well, but there seems to be something missing. However, when he is four David and Polly realise that the violin is his instrument, and he begins taking lessons, and practising up to four hours a day. Because of his violin lessons, Sebastian cannot go to a normal school, so David and Polly engage a governess to teach all the children - Miss Popple, who soon becomes known as Popps.At the suggestion of his violin teacher, David and Polly allow Sebastian to play at a musicians' charity event when he is eight. As a result of this, an important American concert arranger makes an offer for Sebastian to tour America, accompanied by his father. The tour will finish in California, where a great violin master lives: the income from the tour will be enough to pay for lessons. At first Polly refuses, not wanting to break up the family. However, a new offer is made, for the whole family, and Miss Popple, to travel with Sebastian. David and Polly think this will be a wonderful experience for the children, so they agree. Apple Bough is sold, Myra's dog, Wag, is left with Miss Popple's brother, and the family set off for America.One tour is followed by another, and after four years the family has travelled around North and South America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, but they have not been back to England. By this time, the children and Miss Popple are getting tired of travelling: Myra misses Wag, Ethel wants to be a student at the Royal Ballet School, and Wolfgang feels ""it's as if Sebastian was a dog and we were his tail"" When Sebastian turns twelve, he is able to perform in England.

  Her man demanded loyalty, but her body wouldn’t obey.
Have you ever rolled over in the middle of the night and realized you were doing things you swore you’d never do? Sexing brothers you vowed you’d never touch? Bending backwards and stooping lower than you ever thought you’d stoop? Well if you can feel me even a little bit, then let me hit you with a story that just might blow your mind. . . .Nineteen-year-old Juicy Stanfield is the sexy young girlfriend of Granite “G” McKay, owner of Harlem’s notorious G-Spot Social Club. A drug dealer with a lethal streak, he runs Harlem with an iron fist. But even the cash and the bling can’t keep Juicy from getting restless, and while G fulfills her every material desire, she’s burning up with unrequited sexual energy. To cheat on him would mean a death sentence; so Juicy finds pleasure in secret ways: fantasizing on crowded subways or allowing her eyes to hungrily take in the male dancers on the club’s ladies night.But as Juicy’s sexual cravings grow stronger, one thing becomes frighteningly clear: She’s a virtual prisoner in G’s dangerous world. As G begins to suspect her of playin’ him, he pulls the reins he keeps on her even tighter. If she’s ever to escape and get a life of her own she must find a way to start stashing away some of G’s cash. But doing that under G’s watchful eye is a challenge she might not live up to–especially when her appetite tempts her with the deadliest desire of all: G’s very own son. . . .From the Trade Paperback edition.",,,01/01/05,August 29th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Erotica', 'Urban', 'African American', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Erotic Romance', 'Sexuality', 'Drama', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780345486875,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320510954l/298019.jpg,4.44,[],93.0,1.0,,298019.G_Spot,,,,,95.0,7371.0,320,,One World/Ballantine,"['4759', '1529', '751', '209', '123']",,,[],,

Nonna's story is one of suffering, torture, and death--but also of incredible acts of kindness that show the ultimate triumph of faith and love over despair and evil. The Secret Holocaust Diaries is in part a tragedy, yet it's also an unforgettable true story about forgiveness, courage, and hope. Born into an aristocratic Russian family, Nonna Lisowskaja fully expected to enjoy a cultured, privileged life. Her family had many advantages at a time when other Russians struggled to buy food. By her sixth birthday, Nonna spoke four languages. She had a good life. But then her life fell apart. The Nazis invaded Russia.

Oh, and she can't stand the way her neck looks. But her dermatologist tells her there's no quick fix for that.Ephron chronicles her life as an obsessed cook, passionate city dweller, and hapless parent. She recounts her anything-but-glamorous days as a White House intern during the JFK years (""I am probably the only young woman who ever worked in the Kennedy White House that the President did not make a pass at"") and shares how she fell in and out of love with Bill Clinton--from a distance, of course.

The fact that the other woman has ""a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs"" is no consolation. Food sometimes is, though, since Rachel writes cookbooks for a living.

Not to mention her three intensely loyal Labs. But Fiona got to this point by surviving a nightmare.Several years ago, she was the only survivor of a serial killer — a madman who stalked and abducted young women, strangled them, and left them buried with a red scarf on their bodies.

Flying past towering pillars of smoke, parachuting down to the edge of an all-consuming blaze, shoveling and sawing for hours upon hours, days at a time, all to hold the line and push back against the raw power of Mother Nature.But there's also little else as thrilling - at least to Rowan Tripp. The Missoula smoke jumpers are one of the most exclusive fire-fighting squads in the nation, and the job is in Rowan's blood: her father is a legend in the field. She's been fighting fires since her eighteenth birthday. At this point, returning to the wilds of Montana for the season feels like coming home - even with reminders of the partner she lost last season still lingering in the air.Fortunately, this year's rookie crop is among the strongest ever - and Gulliver Curry's one of the best.

Rowan, as a rule, doesn't hook up with other smoke jumpers, but Gull is convinced he can change her mind. And damn if he doesn't make a good case to be an exception to the rule. Everything is thrown off balance, though, when a dark presence lashes out against Rowan, looking to blame someone for last year's tragedy. Rowan knows she can't complicate things with Gull - any distractions in the air or on the ground could be lethal.

"Nora Titone, Doris Kearns Goodwin (Foreword by)",My Thoughts Be Bloody: The Bitter Rivalry Between Edwin and John Wilkes Booth That Led to an American Tragedy,,English,,"The scene of John Wilkes Booth shooting Abraham Lincoln in Ford’s Theatre is among the most vivid and indelible images in American history. The literal story of what happened on April 14, 1865, is familiar: Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth, a lunatic enraged by the Union victory and the prospect of black citizenship. Yet who Booth really was—besides a killer—is less well known. The magnitude of his crime has obscured for generations a startling personal story that was integral to his motivation. My Thoughts Be Bloody, a sweeping family saga, revives an extraordinary figure whose name has been missing, until now, from the story of President Lincoln’s death. Edwin Booth, John Wilkes’s older brother by four years, was in his day the biggest star of the American stage. He won his celebrity at the precocious age of nineteen, before the Civil War began, when John Wilkes was a schoolboy. Without an account of Edwin Booth, author Nora Titone argues, the real story of Lincoln’s assassin has never been told. Using an array of private letters, diaries, and reminiscences of the Booth family, Titone has uncovered a hidden history that reveals the reasons why John Wilkes Booth became this country’s most notorious assassin. These ambitious brothers, born to theatrical parents, enacted a tale of mutual jealousy and resentment worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy. From childhood, the stage-struck brothers were rivals for the approval of their father, legendary British actor Junius Brutus Booth. After his death, Edwin and John Wilkes were locked in a fierce contest to claim his legacy of fame. This strange family history and powerful sibling rivalry were the crucibles of John Wilkes’s character, exacerbating his political passions and driving him into a life of conspiracy. To re-create the lost world of Edwin and John Wilkes Booth, this book takes readers on a panoramic tour of nineteenth-century America, from the streets of 1840s Baltimore to the gold fields of California, from the jungles of the Isthmus of Panama to the glittering mansions of Gilded Age New York. Edwin, ruthlessly competitive and gifted, did everything he could to lock his younger brother out of the theatrical game. As he came of age, John Wilkes found his plans for stardom thwarted by his older sibling’s meteoric rise. Their divergent paths—Edwin’s an upward race to riches and social prominence, and John’s a downward spiral into failure and obscurity—kept pace with the hardening of their opposite political views and their mutual dislike. The details of the conspiracy to kill Lincoln have been well documented elsewhere. My Thoughts Be Bloody tells a new story, one that explains for the first time why Lincoln’s assassin decided to conspire against the president in the first place, and sets that decision in the context of a bitterly divided family—and nation. By the end of this riveting journey, readers will see Abraham Lincoln’s death less as the result of the war between the North and South and more as the climax of a dark struggle between two brothers who never wore the uniform of soldiers, except on stage.",,,,October 19th 2010,"['John Wilkes Booth', 'Edwin Booth']",ebook,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Civil War', 'Biography', 'American History', 'True Crime', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', '19th Century']",,9781416586166,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1376120928l/9196672.jpg,4.27,[],63.0,1.0,,9196672-my-thoughts-be-bloody,,,,,97.0,906.0,496,,Free Press,"['421', '346', '110', '19', '10']",,,[],,

The only land available lay north of Fairbanks near the Arctic Circle where grizzlies outnumbered humans twenty to one. In addition to fierce winters and predatory animals, the Alaskan frontier drew the more unsavory elements of society's fringes. From the beginning, the Cobbs found themselves pitted in a life or death feud with unscrupulous neighbors who would rob from new settlers, attempt to burn them out, shoot them, and jump their claim.The Cobbs were chechakos, tenderfeet, in a lost land that consumed even toughened settlers. Everything, including their ""civilized"" past, conspired to defeat them. They constructed a cabin and the first snow collapsed the roof. They built too close to the creek and spring breakup threatened to flood them out. Bears prowled the nearby woods, stalking the children, and Lester Cobb would leave for months at a time in search of work.But through it all, they survived on the strength of Norma Cobb---a woman whose love for her family knew no bounds and whose courage in the face of mortal danger is an inspiration to us all.

Norma Goldman;Jacob E. Nyenhuis,Latin Via Ovid,A First Course,,Foreign Language Study,"Using an introduction to mythology by the master storyteller Ovid himself, the authors have prepared a unique teaching tool designed to achieve proficiency at Latin in one year at the college level, two years at the high school or intermediate level. The volume provides students with imaginative, connected reading, beginning with introductory prose versions of Ovid's simple myth tales and progressing to the rich poetry of Ovidian Latin (with appropriate teaching aids) within forty lessons. The grammatical approach is traditional, but the central emphasis is on reading. In each chapter the reading appears first, followed by the vocabulary, the grammar, exercises, and etymology relating to the vocabulary. The exercises begin with a group of questions in Latin (based on the reading), to be answered in Latin. Each tale is preceded by a brief discussion in English of the story and its mythological significance. The myths retold by Ovid and the attractive format are conceived to impel the student into acquiring the skill to read the author in the original language.

What if you celebrate your baby's first birthday and your little one is still nursing, with no sign of letting up any time soon? Many a modern mother has felt as though she has embarked on uncharted waters as she continues to breastfeed a child into toddlerhood. The child's need to nurse is clear- but mother has lots of questions.In this revised edition of Mothering Your Nursing Toddler author Norma Jane Bumgarner puts the experience of nursing an older baby or child in perspective, within the context of the entire mother-child relationship.

Norman Beaupre,The Man with the Easel of Horn,,English,,"The Man with the Easel of Horn is an historical novel infused with the fine arts, based on the life and works of neglected master Emile Friant. Well known as a realist painter formed by the Cabanel atelier in Paris at the end of the 19th Cemtury, Friant was a master draughtsman and painter whose works are an extraordinary example of realism in art with academic formation at its core. From his birth in Alsace-Lorraine, The Man with the Easel of Horn follows in the artist's footsteps through the Franco-Prusian War and then, later on, through WWI. We are introduced to the Grand Salon de Paris and meet famous artists such as John Singer Sargent. The novel also reveals the passion and obsession of Emile Friant dealing with love and the question of sensuousness. It's a faithful reflection of life under la Belle Epoque. Very little has been written about Emile Friant and his works, so this novel breaks new ground in the field of fine arts. Professor Emeritus at the University of New England in Maine, Norman Beaupre writes both in French and English. He has done extensive traveling to do research on the subjects for his creative works. His last novel in English deals with Van Gogh in Arles.

Norman Davies,Europe,A History,,History,"Here is a masterpiece of historical narrative that stretches from the Ice Age to the Atomic Age, as it tells the story of Europe, East and West. Norman Davies captures it all-the rise and fall of Rome, the sweeping invasions of Alaric and Atilla, the Norman Conquests, the Papal struggles for power, the Renaissance and the Reformation, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, Europe's rise to become the powerhouse of the world, and its eclipse in our own century, following two devastating World Wars. This is the first major history of Europe to give equal weight to both East and West, and it shines light on fascinating minority communities, from heretics and lepers to Gypsies, Jews, and Muslims. It also takes an innovative approach, combining traditional narrative with unique features that help bring history alive: 299 time capsules scattered through the narrative capture telling aspects of an era. 12 -snapshots offer a panoramic look at all of Europe at a particular moment in history.

Norman G. Finkelstein,The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering,,English,,"Controversial indictment of those who exploit the tragedy of the Holocaust for their own gain.In an iconoclastic and controversial study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in American culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation agreements. It was not until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel's evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it enjoys today. Leaders of America's Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism's victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Thoroughly researched and closely argued, The Holocaust Industry is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.In a devastating new postscript to this best-selling book, Norman G. Finkelstein documents the Holocaust industry's scandalous cover-up of the blackmail of Swiss banks, and in a new appendix demolishes an influential apologia for the Holocaust industry.",,Second Edition,01/01/00,October 17th 2003,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Holocaust', 'Israel', 'Religion', 'Jewish', 'World War II', 'Judaism', 'War']",,9781859844885,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924294l/48836.jpg,4.05,[],273.0,3.0,,48836.The_Holocaust_Industry,,,,,93.0,1884.0,288,,Verso,"['712', '713', '334', '82', '43']",,,[],,
Norman G. Gautreau (Goodreads Author),Sea Room,,English,,"A BookSense 76 selected title As French Canadians living on a saltwater farm overlooking the rugged Maine coast, the Dupuy men are hardworking fishermen and the women are strong and resourceful wives and mothers. Jordi Dupuy is set to become a lobsterman like his father and grandfather when World War II erupts and his father heads to the battlefields. In the wake of the war, Jordi leads three generations of men in building a sailboat worthy of all they have lost and all they have left to live for. Jordi grows up with the code of honor passed down to him, choosing to live a life of integrity--even when it means facing a charge of murder. When Sea Room first appeared in hardback in May 2002, I resolved to visit every bookseller in New England to introduce myself and my book. Using lists from NEBA, BookSense, and the ABA, I plotted a series of trips, little realizing how ambitious my undertaking was. Through a long, hot summer driving a car whose A/C had long ago gone kerflooey, I visited about 150 bookstores, sometimes up to eight a day. But for my ability to take the wrong turn a statistically impossible number of times coupled with New England's antipathy to street signs, I'd have visited more. What started as a journey to introduce my hard-bound, stiff-spined child to the world became a heartening education in the vibrant world of bookstores and the people who run them. Sure, I'd feared hostile receptions. (""What are you doing dropping in unannounced like this?"") But while I did receive two or three such greetings, the vast majority of booksellers were warmly welcoming. Most were people who loved what they were doing. You could see it in their eyes, hear it in their voices. I came awaywith a fondness for booksellers--their love of books; their hospitality to writers; and mostly, most assuredly mostly, their commitment to their customers. What a lesson in the way businesses can be! In almost every store I walked into, the shelves whispered, ""This ain't the phone company."" Also, I feel I made many friends, a good number of whom I saw on several occasions as my efforts yielded up more than fifty store events. So now Sea Room has a softer sibling and I look forward to doing it all again. Oh, if only we have a cool summer...If only I had one of those fancy GPS navigation systems...I was immediately swept away by this evocative and accomplished first novel. Norman Gautreau has created an irresistible universe that centers on a saltwater farm on the rugged coast of Maine during World War II. This is the story of family love and courage under unspeakable circumstances. And the honorable lives of the Dupuy family teach us that, with enough hope, we can always find a little sea room.--E.H.",,,05/01/02,June 1st 2003,[],Paperback,['Historical Fiction'],,9781931561389,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347530994l/2123542.jpg,3.91,"['Massachusetts Book Award for Fiction (2003)', 'National Indie Excellence Awards Nominee (2013)']",47.0,1.0,,2123542.Sea_Room,,,,,93.0,67.0,311,,MacAdam/Cage Publishing,"['19', '30', '13', '3', '2']",,,[],,

Indeed, many view religion in general, and Christianity in particular, as unfounded and unreasonable.Norman Geisler and Frank Turek argue, however, that Christianity is not only more reasonable than all other belief systems, but is indeed more rational than unbelief itself. With conviction and clear thinking, Geisler and Turek guide readers through some of the traditional, tested arguments for the existence of a creator God. They move into an examination of the source of morality and the reliability of the New Testament accounts concerning Jesus.

Norman Maclean,Young Men and Fire,,English,,"     On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen of the United States Forest Service's elite airborne firefighters, The Smoke Jumpers, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned from a ""blowup"" -- an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall -- a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time.  Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R. Wagner Dodge, throws himself into the ashes of an ""escape fire "" - and survives as most of his confused men run, their last moments obscured by smoke. The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman's fire killed their boys.  Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy.     These first deaths among the Forest Service's elite firefighters prompted widespread examination of federal fire policy, of the field of fire science, and of the frailty of young men. For Maclean, who witnessed the fire from the ground in August of 1949,  and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story.  It is a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who ""hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy."" This tale is also Maclean's own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. A canvas on which to tell many stories, including the story of his research into the story itself. And finally Nature's violence colliding with human fallibility.      Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean returned to the scene with two of the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949.  From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy; in his last work that consumed 14 years of his life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award.       The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience. Maclean -- a former University of Chicago English professor and avid fisherman -- also wrote 
  A River Runs Through It and Other Stories
, which is set along the Missouri River, one gulch downstream from Mann Gulch.       ""A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic.""          —  from New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992

"Norman Maclean, Annie Proulx (Foreword)",A River Runs Through it and Other Stories,,English,,"Just as Norman Maclean writes at the end of ""A River Runs through It"" that he is ""haunted by waters,"" so have readers been haunted by his novella. A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the twentieth century. Originally published in 1976, A River Runs through It and Other Stories now celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, marked by this new edition that includes a foreword by Annie Proulx.Maclean grew up in the western Rocky Mountains in the first decades of the twentieth century. As a young man he worked many summers in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its structures and beauty. The beauty he found was in reality, and so he leaves a careful record of what it was like to work in the woods when it was still a world of horse and hand and foot, without power saws, ""cats,"" or four-wheel drives. Populated with drunks, loggers, card sharks, and whores, and set in the small towns and surrounding trout streams and mountains of western Montana, the stories concern themselves with the complexities of fly fishing, logging, fighting forest fires, playing cribbage, and being a husband, a son, and a father.",,25th Anniversary Edition,10/28/76,October 1st 2001,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Nature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Westerns', 'Novels', 'American']",,9780226500669,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924914l/30043.jpg,4.18,[],6320.0,89.0,,30043.A_River_Runs_Through_it_and_Other_Stories,,,,,95.0,22019.0,217,,University of Chicago Press,"['9795', '7675', '3503', '798', '248']",,,"['Missoula, Montana (United States)']",,

Norman Mailer,Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery,,English,,"In perhaps his most important literary feat, Norman Mailer fashions an unprecedented portrait of one of the great villains—and enigmas—in United States history. Here is Lee Harvey Oswald—his family background, troubled marriage, controversial journey to Russia, and return to an “America [waiting] for him like an angry relative whose eyes glare in the heat.” Based on KGB and FBI transcripts, government reports, letters and diaries, and Mailer’s own international research, this is an epic account of a man whose cunning, duplicity, and self-invention were both at home in and at odds with the country he forever altered.  Praise for Oswald’s Tale  “America’s largest mystery has found its greatest interpreter.”—The Washington Post Book World   “Mailer is fierce, courageous, and reckless and nearly everything he writes has sections of headlong brilliance. . . . From the American master conjurer of dark and swirling purpose, a moving reflection.”—Robert Stone, The New York Review of Books  “A narrative of tremendous energy and panache; the author at the top of his form.”—Christopher Hitchens, Financial Times  “The performance of an author relishing the force and reach of his own acuity.”—Martin Amis, The Sunday Times (London)

Norman Mailer,Tough Guys Don't Dance,,English,,"A dark, brilliant novel of astonishing pitch, set in Provincetown, a ""spit of shrub and dune"" captured here in the rawness and melancholy of the off-season, ""Tough Guys Don't Dance"" is the story of Tim Madden, an unsuccessful writer addicted to bourbon, cigarettes, and blonde, careless women with money. On the twenty-fourth morning after the decampment of his wife, Patty Lareine, he awakens with a hangover, considerable sexual excitement, and, on his upper arm, a red tattoo bearing a name from the past. Of the night before, he remembers practically nothing. What he soon learns is that the front passenger seat of his Porsche is soaked with blood and that in a secluded corner of his marijuana stash in a nearby woods rests a blonde head, severed at the throat.Is Madden therefore a murderer? He has no way of knowing. As in many novels of crime, the narrative centers on violence--physical, sexual, and emotional--but these elements move in their orbits through a rich constellation of character as Madden tries to reconstruct the missing hours of a terrible evening. In the course of this in-quiry a bizarre and vividly etched gallery of characters reappears to him as in a dream--ex-prizefighters, sexual junkies, mediums, former cons, a police chief, a world-weary former girl friend, and Mad-den's father, old now but still a Herculean figure, a practitioner of the sternest backroom ethics.""Tough Guys Don't Dance"" represents Mailer at the peak of his powers with a stunningly conceived novel that soon transcends its origins as a mystery to become a relentless search into the recesses and buried virtues of the modern American male.

Norman Mailer,The Fight,,English,,"In 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaïre, two African American boxers were paid five million dollars apiece to fight each other. One was Muhammad Ali, the aging but irrepressible “professor of boxing.” The other was George Foreman, who was as taciturn as Ali was voluble. Observing them was Norman Mailer, a commentator of unparalleled energy, acumen, and audacity. Whether he is analyzing the fighters’ moves, interpreting their characters, or weighing their competing claims on the African and American souls, Mailer’s grasp of the titanic battle’s feints and stratagems—and his sensitivity to their deeper symbolism—makes this book a masterpiece of the literature of sport.  Praise for The Fight  “Exquisitely refined and attenuated . . . [a] sensitive portrait of an extraordinary athlete and man, and a pugilistic drama fully as exciting as the reality on which it is based.”—The New York Times    “One of the defining texts of sports journalism.

Norman Mailer,An American Dream,,English,,"In this wild battering ram of a novel, which was originally published to vast controversy in 1965, Norman Mailer creates a character who might be a fictional precursor of the philosopher-killer he would later profile in The Executioner’s Song. As Stephen Rojack, a decorated war hero and former congressman who murders his wife in a fashionable New York City high-rise, runs amok through the city in which he was once a privileged citizen, Mailer peels away the layers of our social norms to reveal a world of pure appetite and relentless cruelty.

Norman Mailer,The Executioner's Song,,English,,"In what is arguably his greatest work, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize",,,10/30/79,April 28th 1998,['Gary Gilmore'],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Literature', 'Mystery', 'American', 'Journalism']",,9780375700811,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325755176l/12468.jpg,4.07,"['Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (1980)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (1979)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (Hardcover) (1980) & (Paperback) (1981)']",2398.0,37.0,,12468.The_Executioner_s_Song,,,,,94.0,18412.0,1056,,Vintage Books USA,"['7127', '6879', '3228', '836', '342']",,,['Utah (United States)'],,
Norman Mailer,"The Armies of the Night: History as a Novel, the Novel as History",,English,,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book AwardFifty years after the March on the Pentagon, Norman Mailer’s seminal tour de force remains as urgent and incisive as ever. Winner of America’s two highest literary awards, The Armies of the Night uniquely and unforgettably captures the Sixties’ tidal wave of love and rage at its crest and a towering genius at his peak. The time is October 21, 1967. The place is Washington, D.C. Depending on the paper you read, 20,000 to 200,000 protestors are marching to end the war in Vietnam, while helicopters hover overhead and federal marshals and soldiers with fixed bayonets await them on the Pentagon steps. Among the marchers is a writer named Norman Mailer. From his own singular participation in the day’s events and his even more extraordinary perceptions comes a classic work that shatters the mold of traditional reportage.

In this series of conversations, John Buffalo Mailer, 27, poses a series of questions to his father, challenging the reflections and insights of the man who has dominated and defined much of American letters for the past sixty years. Their wide-ranging discussions take place over the course of a year, beginning in July 2004. Set against the backdrop of George W. Bush's re-election campaign and the war in Iraq, each considers what it means to live in America today. John asks his father to look back to World War II, and explore the parallels that can—and cannot—be drawn between that time and our current post-9/11 consciousness. As their conversations develop, the topics shift from the political to the personal to the political again, as they duck and weave around one another. They explore their shared admiration of boxing and poker, the nature of marriage and love, television, movies, writing, and what it means to be a part of this extraordinary family.",,,,2006.0,,,,1560258241,9781560258247,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9oBpswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.31,,,,,,,,,,,,218.0,,,,67.0,,,,

Resentful of a childhood lost to his father’s reckless and demanding adventures, young Ollestad was often paralyzed by fear. Set in Malibu and Mexico in the late 1970s, the book captures the earthy surf culture of Southern California; the boy’s conflicted feelings for his magnetic father; and the exhilarating tests of skill in the surf and snow that prepared young Norman to become a fearless surfer and ski champion--which ultimately saved his life.In February 1979, just as he was reaping the rewards of his training, a chartered Cessna carrying Norman, his father, his father’s girlfriend, and the pilot, crashed into the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California and was suspended at eight thousand feet, engulfed in a blizzard. Norman’s father, his coach and hero, was dead, and the 11-year old Ollestad had to descend the mountain alone and grief-stricken, through snow and ice, without any gear.Stunningly, the boy defied the elements and put his father’s passionate lessons to work.

One of the group's most noteworthy and enduring achievements was the Slave Narrative Collection, consisting of more than 2,000 transcripts of interviews with former slaves, who, in blunt, simple words, provided often-startling first-person accounts of their lives in bondage. This book reprints some of the most detailed and engrossing life histories in the collection. Each narrative is complete.Thirty-four gripping testimonies are included, with all slave occupations represented — from field hand and cook to French tutor and seamstress. Personal treatment reported by these individuals also encompassed a wide range — from the most harsh and exploitative to living and working conditions that were intimate and benevolent.An illuminating and unique source of information about life in the South before, during, and after the Civil War, these memoirs, most importantly, preserve the opinions and perspective of those who were enslaved.

Noé Álvarez (Goodreads Author),"Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America's Stolen Land",,English,,"The son of working-class Mexican immigrants flees a life of labor in fruit-packing plants to run in a Native American marathon from Canada to Guatemala in this ""stunning memoir that moves to the rhythm of feet, labor, and the many landscapes of the Americas"" (Catriona Menzies-Pike, author of The Long Run).Growing up in Yakima, Washington, Noé Álvarez worked at an apple-packing plant alongside his mother, who “slouched over a conveyor belt of fruit, shoulder to shoulder with mothers conditioned to believe this was all they could do with their lives.” A university scholarship offered escape, but as a first-generation Latino college-goer, Álvarez struggled to fit in.At nineteen, he learned about a Native American/First Nations movement called the Peace and Dignity Journeys, epic marathons meant to renew cultural connections across North America. He dropped out of school and joined a group of Dené, Secwépemc, Gitxsan, Dakelh, Apache, Tohono O’odham, Seri, Purépecha, and Maya runners, all fleeing difficult beginnings. Telling their stories alongside his own, Álvarez writes about a four-month-long journey from Canada to Guatemala that pushed him to his limits. He writes not only of overcoming hunger, thirst, and fear―dangers included stone-throwing motorists and a mountain lion―but also of asserting Indigenous and working-class humanity in a capitalist society where oil extraction, deforestation, and substance abuse wreck communities.Running through mountains, deserts, and cities, and through the Mexican territory his parents left behind, Álvarez forges a new relationship with the land, and with the act of running, carrying with him the knowledge of his parents’ migration, and―against all odds in a society that exploits his body and rejects his spirit―the dream of a liberated future.",,,,March 3rd 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Sports', 'Nature', 'Adventure', 'Autobiography']",,9781948226462,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1571110599l/49411424._SX318_SY475_.jpg,3.58,[],90.0,1.0,,49411424-spirit-run,,,,,92.0,1188.0,240,,Catapult,"['199', '408', '482', '85', '14']",,,[],,

Confined to a wheelchair because of her cerebral palsy and denied formal schooling in Syria because of her illness, Nujeen taught herself English by watching American soap operas. When her small town became the epicenter of the brutal fight between ISIS militants and US-backed Kurdish troops in 2014, she and her family were forced to flee.Despite her physical limitations, Nujeen embarked on the arduous trek to safety and a new life. The grueling sixteen-month odyssey by foot, boat, and bus took her across Turkey and the Mediterranean to Greece, through Macedonia to Serbia and Hungary, and finally, to Germany. Yet, in spite of the tremendous physical hardship she endured, Nujeen's extraordinary optimism never wavered. Refusing to give in to despair or see herself as a passive victim, she kept her head high. As she told a BBC reporter, ""You should fight to get what you want in this world.""Nujeen's positivity and resolve infuses this unforgettable story of one young woman determined to make a better life for herself.

Nwaocha Ogechukwu (Goodreads Author),The Secret Behind the Cross and Crucifix,,English,,"If you're a Dan Brown fan, you'll want to read, The Secret Behind the Cross and Crucifix. Author Nwaocha Ogechukwu has written an easy to read, enlightening and academically sound book regarding the symbolism and meaning of the cross in relation to religion. Ogechukwu gives historical accounts of Christianity's cover up of what the cross truly is: a satanic symbol. ""For centuries after Christ, the church and other religions that use cruciform symbols have misrepresented the physical nature of Christ's death with a satanic symbol (cross), and a pagan idol (corpus). This secret has been concealed by the church for centuries after Christ."" Ogechukwu's research leads to a stunning conclusion as it explores to understand the real nature of Christ's death, religion's role in the symbolism, and to release humankind from the ""painful knowledge bondage"" of cruciform propaganda. Nwaocha Ogechukwu is a graduate of medical science, member of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, and a researcher in philosophy, religion, history, and psychology.

It’s a novel aimed at those who like to read, those who let themselves be absorbed into the reading because it requires a lot of imagination and there are lots of things which are just hinted at.” -Review in La Mañana“This book tells the story of Anna, a writer, and the world and lives of the people around her. Anna lives her literary life as her real one, suffering from a kind of schizophrenia as the characters in her books collide with her life in their desire to see the light. The original was published in Spain in 2008.” -Debbie Garrick, Translator“The Dead Writer” is, in essence, an invitation to all those who enjoy the way that literature reflects itself within a literary work. But it also represents the opportunity to follow other characters with feelings in situations that inevitably provoke recognition. [...] A delightful literary text which stands out with metaphorical language and suggests images that are capable of depicting daily scenes containing a multitude of possibilities that often, life does not let us see.” -Dr Alexandra Santos Pinheiro, in the magazine Resonancias Literarias, no. 153“The Dead Writer, a novel which not only demonstrates the author's skill but also how we see her handling of the essential tool of all writers, language.
