200 Golden Hadith,,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction']","Get this book from iBook store by following URL http://goo.gl/eNxGwdEvery Muslim is aware of the importance of the Prophet’s hadiths. Islam is based on two major sources: the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and the latter is available to us in the form of hadiths. The Prophet said, “Whoever comes to know one hadith of mine should spread it.” However, the Prophet also told us to be careful when spreading his hadiths so as not to alter any component of it, otherwise, “he can take his seat in the hellfire.”Within this book I have incorporated 200 small hadiths of the Prophet. The reason for choosing the smaller hadiths of the Prophets is so that the youth can easily become accustomed to the words of the Prophet. All the hadiths concern the important matters of the religion, which every person should have knowledge of. I have come to the realization that many youth from among the Muslims have not memorized even one hadith of the Prophet. For this reason I have chosen smaller hadiths so that they can be easily memorized by them and they can spread them to others. This way our relatives and our friends can memorize some words of the Prophet which will bring them benefit in the hereafter.This book has purposely not been organized into any specific categories. Experience through the years has taught me that this style of non-categorization is easier for the general masses who are not scholars or students of knowledge. I am also aware that many languages exists out there in which the hadiths of the Prophet have not yet been translated. This is why, Allah-willing, my intention is to have this small work translated into at least 30 different languages.",,,,December 16th 2013,[],ebook,,B00EUF282O,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384949219l/18513760.jpg,4.41,[],90.0,1.0,,,,92.0,290.0,45,Darussalam Publishers,"['201', '47', '18', '7', '17']",,[],,"['Abdul Malik Mujahid', 'Darussalam']"

24 HOURS TO BREXIT (BENEFICIARIES ODYSSEY Book 1),,[],"There are only 24-hours left to save the Brexit deal with Europe, but in the world of UK politics, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This story is a technothriller embracing alternative history for debate. As our lives get drastically changed by technology, we can actively use this as a lens through which we all embrace change, and our ability to cope with broader social and ethical issues in the society. Ada Eugène Kowalski, a rising political star, is thrust into the limelight just as the Prime Minister has resigned from office due to allegations of misconduct. Unbeknownst to the public and her Cabinet, Ada Eugène Kowalski is a Beneficiary—the result of a series of experiments pieced together after a German man’s accident during the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ada doesn't have the faintest idea how to run a country, let alone guide the UK through complex Brexit negotiations and the previous PM’s scandal. All Ada knows is there is no other option but to form alliances with old foes to save the country. Will Ada be able to navigate the complex world of The Consortium that wants to take over the world, the mysterious Factory of Spare Parts conducting military experiments on humans, the general public's propensity for sudden riots, and Parliament to bring the UK through Brexit in one piece?",,,,December 16th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,,B07LDY1D3H,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545156822l/43264365._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,3.0,89,StellarArt Publishing,[],,[],,['Appollonia Solange']

P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda -each imbued with a twenty-first-century aptitude for quantum theory and existential psychology-and you get the voice of Daniel Pinchbeck. And yet, nothing quite prepares us for the lucidity, rationale, and informed audacity of this seeker, skeptic, and cartographer of hidden realms. Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck had been a member of New York's literary select. He wrote for publications such as ""The New York Times Magazine,"" ""Esquire,"" and ""Harper's Bazaar."" His first book, ""Breaking Open the Head,"" was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna. But slowly something happened: Rather than writing from a journalistic remove, Pinchbeck-his literary powers at their peak-began to participate in the shamanic and metaphysical belief systems he was encountering. As his psyche and body opened to new experience, disparate threads and occurrences made sense like never before: Humanity, every sign pointed, is precariously balanced between greater self-potential and environmental disaster. The Mayan calendar's ""end date"" of 2012 seems to define our present age: It heralds the end of one way of existence and the return of another, in which the serpent god Quetzalcoatl reigns anew, bringing with him an unimaginably ancient-yet, to us, wholly new-way of living.

Thing 4: The washing machine has changed the world more than the Internet. Thing 5: Assume the worst about people, and you get the worst. Thing 13: Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer.If you've wondered how we did not see the economic collapse coming, Ha-Joon Chang knows the answer: We didn't ask what they didn't tell us about capitalism. This is a lighthearted book with a serious purpose: to question the assumptions behind the dogma and sheer hype that the dominant school of neoliberal economists-the apostles of the freemarket-have spun since the Age of Reagan.Chang, the author of the international bestseller Bad Samaritans, is one of the world's most respected economists, a voice of sanity-and wit-in the tradition of John Kenneth Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz. 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism equips readers with an understanding of how global capitalism works-and doesn't. In his final chapter, ""How to Rebuild the World,"" Chang offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends, instead of becoming slaves of the market.Ha-Joon Chang teaches in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge. His books include the bestselling Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism.

La complicidad se vuelve vodevil intelectual y desemboca en un peregrinaje a Santa Teresa (trasunto de Ciudad Juárez), donde hay quien dice que Archimboldi ha sido visto. Ya allí, Pelletier y Espinoza se enteran de que la ciudad es desde años atrás escenario de una larga cadena de crímenes: en los vertederos aparecen cadáveres de mujeres con señales de haber sido violadas y torturadas.

28: Stories of AIDS in Africa,,"['Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Medicine', 'Health', 'Medical', 'Short Stories', 'Canada', 'International Development', 'Biography', 'Science']","From one of our most widely read, award-winning journalists – comes the powerful, unputdownable story of the very human cost of a global pandemic of staggering scope and scale. It is essential reading for our times.In 28, Stephanie Nolen, the Globe and Mail’s Africa Bureau Chief, puts a human face to the crisis created by HIV-AIDS in Africa. She has achieved, in this amazing book, something extraordinary: she writes with a power, understanding and simplicity that makes us listen, makes us understand and care. Through riveting anecdotal stories – one for each of the million people living with HIV-AIDS in Africa – Nolen explores the effects of an epidemic that well exceeds the Black Plague in magnitude. It is a calamity that is unfolding just a 747-flight away, and one that will take the lives of these 28 million without the help of massive, immediate intervention on an unprecedented scale. 28 is a timely, transformative, thoroughly accessible book that shows us definitively why we continue to ignore the growth of HIV-AIDS in Africa only at our peril and at an intolerable moral cost.28’s stories are much more than a record of the suffering and loss in 28 emblematic lives. Here we meet women and men fighting vigorously on the frontlines of disease: Tigist Haile Michael, a smart, shy 14-year-old Ethiopian orphan fending for herself and her baby brother on the slum streets of Addis Ababa; Alice Kadzanja, an HIV-positive nurse in Malawi, where one in six adults has the virus, and where the average adult’s life expectancy is 36; and Zackie Achmat, the hero of South Africa’s politically fragmented battle against HIV-AIDS. 28 also tells us how the virus works, spreads and, ultimately, kills. It explains the connection of HIV-AIDS to conflict, famine and the collapse of states; shows us how easily treatment works for those lucky enough to get it and details the struggles of those who fight to stay alive with little support. It makes vivid the strong, desperate people doing all they can, and maintaining courage, dignity and hope against insurmountable odds. It is – in its humanity, beauty and sorrow – a call to action for all who read it.",,,,April 24th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780676978223,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320398136l/1273062.jpg,4.28,[],93.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2189.0,416,Knopf Canada,"['1139', '657', '289', '67', '37']",,[],,['Stephanie Nolen']

21 Lessons for the 21st Century,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Society', 'Technology']","In Sapiens, he explored our past. In Homo Deus, he looked to our future. Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power.
