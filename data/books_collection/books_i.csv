After a destructive battle, the ancient swaying city of Deepgate has been overtaken. Most of the chains that suspend it have given way, toxic fumes are emanating from blazing structures, and the temple once inhabited by the ruling Presbyter now dangles upside down above the once-uncharted abyss. The victorious Spine have initiated martial law and are ruthlessly pursuing all who attempt to leave. Amid the turmoil, two captives are returned. Arriving by ship are the young angel Dill, now toughened by war, and traitor assassin Rachel Hael. Incarcerated in the slowly crumbling temple, the two await their fate, while from the abyss beneath them ghosts rise—for the death of the god Ulcis has left open the gates to Hell.But on orders from his divine brethren, Cospinol, the god of brine and fog, is traveling the world to Deepgate to seal this breach. His great skyship is being dragged through the air by the giant John Anchor, a monster of a man enslaved to pull the god’s vessel, moving slowly, inevitably, toward the city.As the city waits, teetering on the brink, myriad plans for vengeance are set in motion, from the continent of Pandemeria to Heaven itself. Among them is a ghostly archon sent to deliver a message to the gods on earth—using Dill as his vessel. Thrust from his body, Dill’s own soul returns to Hell. When Dill and Rachel are attacked by Spine assassins, Rachel has no choice but to try to escape with the creature that calls itself Dill…and to somehow find a way to restore her friend’s soul before it’s too late. For powerful forces are stirring, and in the coming battle between gods, it is the world of men that is at stake.From the Hardcover edition.",Deepgate Codex #2,,01/01/08,April 29th 2008,"['Dill', 'Carnival', 'Rachel Hael']",Hardcover,,9780553384178,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400515823l/2598001.jpg,3.62,[],95.0,1.0,,,,87.0,1856.0,400,Spectra,"['371', '686', '562', '192', '45']",,[],,['Alan Campbell']
"I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan",,"['Humor', 'Fiction', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Pop Culture', 'Novels', 'Tv', 'Modern']","Book by Partridge, Alan.Journalist, presenter, broadcaster, husband, father, vigorous all-rounder: Alan Partridge. Star of action blockbuster Alpha Papa; a man with a fascinating past and an amazing future.Gregarious and popular, yet Alan’s never happier than when relaxing in his own five-bedroom, south-built house with three acres of land and access to a private stream. But who is this mysterious enigma?Alan Gordon Partridge is the best – and best-loved – radio presenter in the region. Born into a changing world of rationing, Teddy Boys, apes in space and the launch of ITV, Alan’s broadcasting career began as chief DJ of Radio Smile at St. Luke’s Hospital in Norwich. After replacing Peter Flint as the presenter of Scout About, he entered the top 8 of BBC sports presenters.But Alan’s big break came with his primetime BBC chat show Knowing Me, Knowing You. Sadly, the show battled against poor scheduling, having been put up against News at Ten, then in its heyday. Due to declining ratings, a single catastrophic hitch (the killing of a guest on air) and the dumbing down of network TV, Alan’s show was cancelled. Not to be dissuaded, he embraced this opportunity to wind up his production company, leave London and fulfil a lifelong ambition to return to his roots in local radio.Now single, Alan is an intensely private man but he opens up, for the second time, in this candid, entertaining, often deeply emotional – and of course compelling – memoir, written entirely in his own words. (Alan quickly dispelled the idea of using a ghost writer. With a grade B English Language O-Level, he knew he was up to the task.)He speaks touchingly about his tragic Toblerone addiction, and the painful moment when unsold copies of his first autobiography, Bouncing Back, were pulped like ‘word porridge’. He reveals all about his relationship with his ex-Ukrainian girlfriend, Sonja, with whom he had sex at least twice a day, and the truth about the thick people who make key decisions at the BBC.A literary tour de force, I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan charts the incredible journey of one of our greatest broadcasters.",,,01/01/11,September 29th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780007449170,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494078833l/12363948._SY475_.jpg,4.22,[],100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,8282.0,320,HarperCollins,"['3633', '3160', '1208', '221', '60']",,[],,"['Alan Partridge', 'Rob Gibbons', 'Neil Gibbons', 'Armando Iannucci', 'Steve Coogan']"

Idylls of the King,,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Arthurian', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', '19th Century', 'Victorian']","Alternate cover edition of ISBN10: 0140422536; ISBN13: 9780140422535Written in the middle of his career, Idylls of the King is Tennyson's longest and most ambitious work. Reflecting his lifelong interest in Arthurian themes, his primary sources were Malory's Morte d'Arthur and the Welsh Mabinogion. For him, the Idylls embodied the universal and unending war between sense and soul, and Arthur the highest ideals of manhood and kingship; an attitude totally compatible with the moral outlook of his age.

Innocent Traitor,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Tudor Period', 'British Literature', '16th Century', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Religion']","BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Alison Weir's Mary Boleyn.I am now a condemned traitor . . . I am to die when I have hardly begun to live.  Historical expertise marries page-turning fiction in Alison Weir’s enthralling debut novel, breathing new life into one of the most significant and tumultuous periods of the English monarchy. It is the story of Lady Jane Grey–“the Nine Days’ Queen” –a fifteen-year-old girl who unwittingly finds herself at the center of the religious and civil unrest that nearly toppled the fabled House of Tudor during the sixteenth century.  The child of a scheming father and a ruthless mother, for whom she is merely a pawn in a dynastic game with the highest stakes, Jane Grey was born during the harrowingly turbulent period between Anne Boleyn’s beheading and the demise of Jane’s infamous great-uncle, King Henry VIII. With the premature passing of Jane’ s adolescent cousin, and Henry’s successor, King Edward VI, comes a struggle for supremacy fueled by political machinations and lethal religious fervor.   Unabashedly honest and exceptionally intelligent, Jane possesses a sound strength of character beyond her years that equips her to weather the vicious storm. And though she has no ambitions to rule, preferring to immerse herself in books and religious studies, she is forced to accept the crown, and by so doing sets off a firestorm of intrigue, betrayal, and tragedy.  Alison Weir uses her unmatched skills as a historian to enliven the many dynamic characters of this majestic drama. Along with Lady Jane Grey, Weir vividly renders her devious parents; her much-loved nanny; the benevolent Queen Katherine Parr; Jane’s ambitious cousins; the Catholic “Bloody” Mary, who will stop at nothing to seize the throne; and the Protestant and future queen Elizabeth. Readers venture inside royal drawing rooms and bedchambers to witness the power-grabbing that swirls around Lady Jane Grey from the day of her birth to her unbearably poignant death. Innocent Traitor paints a complete and compelling portrait of this captivating young woman, a faithful servant of God whose short reign and brief life would make her a legend.",,,10/28/06,February 27th 2007,"['Anne Boleyn', 'Guildford Dudley', 'Lady Jane Grey', 'Henry VIII of England', 'Catherine Parr', 'Elizabeth I of England', 'Edward VI of England', 'Mary I of England']",Hardcover,,9780345494856,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388228144l/111218.jpg,3.95,[],610.0,9.0,,,,94.0,30822.0,402,Ballantine Books,"['9639', '12336', '6929', '1390', '528']",,"['London, England', 'Sudeley, England (United Kingdom)', 'Tower of London, London, England (United Kingdom)']",,['Alison Weir']

In an Antique Land,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'India', 'Egypt', 'Memoir', 'Anthropology', 'Africa', 'School', 'Biography']","Once upon a time an Indian writer named Amitav Ghosh set out to find an Indian slave, name unknown, who some seven hundred years before had traveled to the Middle East. The journey took him to a small village in Egypt, where medieval customs coexist with twentieth-century desires and discontents. But even as Ghosh sought to re-create the life of his Indian predecessor, he found himself immersed in those of his modern Egyptian neighbors.Combining shrewd observations with painstaking historical research, Ghosh serves up skeptics and holy men, merchants and sorcerers. Some of these figures are real, some only imagined, but all emerge as vividly as the characters in a great novel.

Eppure, quando crede che il peggio sia alle spalle si ritrova tra le mani il libro da cui tutto è cominciato. Il libro che custodisce le ombre del suo passato.

Arianna entra nella sua vita con una naturalezza che lo strega, e dal giorno in cui la sposa Giulio cerca di restituirle la luce che lei gli ha portato offrendole tutto ciò che potrebbe desiderare: anche quello che lui, a causa di un grave incidente, non può più darle... Così della loro routine entrano presto a far parte gli appuntamenti del giovedì, meticolosamente organizzati da Giulio in persona: in un pied-à-terre appartato o in una cabina sulla spiaggia, secondo la stagione, gli uomini destinati a incontrare Arianna sono tenuti a rispettare poche regole inviolabili.Nella vita di questa coppia, dunque, segreti non ce ne sono. Ogni tanto, però, Giulio è attraversato dalla consapevolezza che qualcosa gli sfugge: ""Tu non mi hai detto tutto di te"" le sussurra mentre non riesce a fare a meno di viziarla. È così. Di segreti Arianna ne ha molti, e brucianti - tanto che forse nemmeno lei ne conserva un ricordo nitido. Ma quello che custodisce più gelosamente è il ""tuttomio"": una ""tana"" tutta sua, ricavata in un angolo del solaio, come la piccola caverna dove si rifugiava da bambina, in campagna.Ed è lì, nel tuttomio, che Arianna si confida con la sua unica vera amica, Stefania.I giochi di Arianna e Giulio sono troppo torbidi e coinvolgenti per non farsi, con il passare del tempo, pericolosi. Tanto più perché lei, come ogni bambina, non ha chiaro il confine che separa il gioco dalla realtà. E può bastare lo sguardo di un ragazzino ingenuo e focoso, a cui è difficile dire di no, perché le regole rischino di essere infrante e un vento sinistro porti scompiglio nella casa di bambola che Giulio ha costruito.Ispirato alla scandalosa vicenda dei marchesi Casati Stampa, ma anche percorso da una fitta trama di rimandi a grandi classici come Santuario di Faulkner e L'amante di Lady Chatterley di Lawrence, questo romanzo mette in scena una protagonista femminile straordinaria: inquietante nel suo candore, splen- dente di una luce nerissima. Quando abbandona la lingua mescidata dei suoi romanzi siciliani, Camilleri dispiega una scrittura magistralmente essenziale, limpidissima - verrebbe da dire spietata - eppure priva di inibizioni.

Intercourse,,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Sexuality', 'Gender', 'Feminist Theory', 'Politics', 'Gender Studies', 'Womens', 'Theory']","Andrea Dworkin, once called “Feminism’s Malcolm X,” has been worshipped, reviled, criticized, and analyzed-but never ignored. The power of her writing, the passion of her ideals, and the ferocity of her intellect have spurred the arguments and activism of two generations of feminists. Now the book that she’s best known for-in which she provoked the argument that ultimately split apart the feminist movement-is being reissued for the young women and men of the twenty-first century. Intercourse enraged as many readers as it inspired when it was first published in 1987. In it, Dworkin argues that in a male supremacist society, sex between men and women constitutes a central part of women’s subordination to men. (This argument was quickly-and falsely-simplified to “all sex is rape” in the public arena, adding fire to Dworkin’s already radical persona.) In her introduction to this twentieth-anniversary edition of Intercourse, Ariel Levy, the author of Female Chauvinist Pigs, discusses the circumstances of Dworkin’s untimely death in the spring of 2005, and the enormous impact of her life and work. Dworkin’s argument, she points out, is the stickiest question of feminism: Can a woman fight the power when he shares her bed?",,,10/29/87,November 7th 2006,[],Paperback,,9780465017522,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557673711l/163265.jpg,3.84,[],192.0,2.0,,,,87.0,1591.0,349,Basic Books,"['568', '501', '315', '116', '91']",,[],,"['Andrea Dworkin', 'Ariel Levy']"

Il giardino delle mosche,,['Nonfiction'],"«Viene in mente Memorie del sottosuolo di Dostoevskij». Alberto Sebastiani, La Repubblica «Il libro lascia senza fiato […] Ogni paragone con la romanzeria media sarebbe fuori luogo. Oltre a fare squadra a sé, Tarabbia gioca in un’altra categoria, quella poco affollata dei fuoriclasse». Alessandro Gnocchi, Il Giornale Tra il 1978 e il 1990, mentre in Unione Sovietica il potere si scopriva fragile e una certa visione del mondo si avviava al tramonto, Andrej Čikatilo, marito e padre di famiglia, comunista convinto e lavoratore, mutilava e uccideva nei modi più orrendi almeno cinquantasei persone. Le sue vittime – bambini e ragazzi di entrambi i sessi, ma anche donne – avevano tutte una caratteristica comune: vivevano ai margini della società o non si sapevano adattare alle sue regole. Erano insomma simboli del fallimento dell’Idea comunista, sintomi dell’imminente crollo del Socialismo reale.Questo libro, sospeso tra romanzo e biografia, narra la storia di uno dei più feroci assassini del Novecento attraverso la visionaria, a tratti metafisica ricostruzione della confessione che egli rese in seguito all’arresto. E fa di più. Osa raccontare l’orrore e il fallimento in prima persona: Čikatilo, infatti, in questo libro dice «io». È lui stesso a farci entrare nella propria vita e nella propria testa, a raccontarci le sue pulsioni più segrete, le sue umiliazioni e ossessioni.Il giardino delle mosche è un libro lirico e crudele allo stesso tempo: la storia di un’anima sbagliata, una meditazione sul potere e la sconfitta e, soprattutto, una discesa impietosa fino alle radici del Male.",,,,September 17th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,9788868333454,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446593893l/27422878._SY475_.jpg,4.19,[],68.0,1.0,,,,100.0,84.0,271,Ponte alle Grazie,"['28', '44', '12', '0', '0']",,[],,['Andrea Tarabbia']

Inherit the Truth: A Memoir of Survival and the Holocaust,,"['Holocaust', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']","In the years following her liberation from the Nazi death camp, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, like most survivors of the Holocaust, struggled to build a normal life for herself. Decades later, she realized that in her efforts to achieve normality she had not spoken to her children or her grandchildren of her terrifying odyssey. Her memoir of the period between 1939 and 1945, was written for her children so that they would Inherit the Truth.This is the story of the destruction of a talented Jewish family, and of the survival against all the odds of two young sisters. Anita and her elder sister Renate defied death at the hands of the Gestapo and the SS over a period of two and a half years, being first imprisoned as criminals and then being transferred, separately to Auschwitz, and finally to Belsen. They were saved by their exceptional courage, determination and ingenuity, and by several improbable strokes of good luck -- the greatest of which was the fact that Anita played the cello. Lasker-Wallfisch draws from her own startlingly vivid memories of her experience, and also incorporates the letters her family wrote to one another during this period as well as other primary documents.

"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans",,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook']","“Uttering lines that send liberals into paroxysms of rage, otherwise known as ‘citing facts,’ is the spice of life. When I see the hot spittle flying from their mouths and the veins bulging and pulsing above their eyes, well, that’s when I feel truly alive.”So begins If Democrats Had Any Brains, They’d Be Republicans, Ann Coulter’s funniest, most devastating, and, yes, most outrageous book to date. Coulter has become the brightest star in the conservative firmament thanks to her razor-sharp reasoning and biting wit. Of course, practically any time she opens her mouth, liberal elites denounce Ann, insisting that “She’s gone too far!” and hopefully predicting that this time it will bring a crashing end to her career. Now you can read all the quotes that have so outraged her enemies and so delighted her legions of fans. More than just the definitive collection of Coulterisms, If Democrats Had Any Brains, They’d Be Republicans includes dozens of brand-new commentaries written by Coulter and hundreds of never-before-published quotations. This is Ann at her best, covering every topic from A to Z. Here you’ll read Coulter’s take on:• Her politics: “As far as I’m concerned, I’m a middle-of-the-road moderate and the rest of you are crazy.”• Hillary Clinton: “Hillary wants to be the first woman president, which would also make her the first woman in a Clinton administration to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office instead of under it.” • The environment: “God gave us the earth. We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees. God said, ‘Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It’s yours.’” • Religion: “It’s become increasingly difficult to distinguish the pronouncements of the Episcopal Church from the latest Madonna video.”• Global warming: “The temperature of the planet has increased about one degree Fahrenheit in the last century. So imagine a summer afternoon when it’s 63 degrees and the next thing you know it’s . . . 64 degrees. Ahhhh!!!! Run for your lives, everybody! Women and children first!” • Gun control: “Mass murderers apparently can’t read, since they are constantly shooting up ‘gun-free zones.’”• Bill Clinton: “Bill Clinton’s library is the first one to ever feature an Adults Only section.”• Illegal aliens: “I am the illegal alien of commentary. I will do the jokes that no one else will do.”If Democrats Had Any Brains, They’d Be Republicans is a must-have for anyone who loves (or loves to hate) Ann Coulter.",,,01/01/07,October 2nd 2007,"['Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Rodham Clinton']",Hardcover,,9780307353450,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388536383l/266384.jpg,3.43,[],84.0,1.0,,,,75.0,1671.0,288,Crown Forum,"['504', '429', '323', '106', '309']",,[],,['Ann Coulter']
In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'History', '21st Century']","Donald Trump isn't a politician -- he's a one-man wrecking ball against our dysfunctional and corrupt establishment. Now Ann Coulter, with her unique insight, candor, and sense of humor, makes the definitive case for why we should all join his revolution. The three biggest news stories of the 2016 election have been Trump, Trump, and Trump. The media have twisted themselves in knots, trying to grasp how he won over millions of Republicans, whether he really has a shot in November, and what he'd be like as President. But Ann Coulter isn't puzzled. She knows why Trump was the only one of 17 GOP contenders who captured the spirit of our time. She gets the power of addressing the pain of the silent majority and saying things the PC Thought Police considers unspeakable. She argues that a bull in the china shop is exactly what we need to make America great again. In this short but powerful book, Coulter explains why conservatives, moderates, and even disgruntled Democrats should set aside their doubts and embrace Trump:·He's flipped the GOP from a globalist party to a nationalist party, just when it's essential that we put America first in our trade deals and alliances.·He's abandoned the GOP's decades-long commitment to a bellicose foreign policy, at a time when the entire country is sick of unnecessary wars.·He's ended GOP pandering to Hispanics with his hard line on immigration. Working class Americans finally have a champion against open borders and cheap immigrant labor.·He's broken the power of identity politics. It turns out you don't need to act religious to win the Evangelical vote; or talk about your dad the bartender to win the blue collar vote; or have served in the military to win the military vote.·He's overturned the media's traditional role in setting the agenda and defining who gets to be considered ""presidential.""·He's exposed political consultants as grifters and hacks, most of whom don't know real voters from a hole in the ground.If you're already a Trump fan, Ann Coulter will help you defend and promote your position.

It's Like This,,"['M M Romance', 'BDSM', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Erotica', 'Coming Of Age', 'Gay', 'Family', 'New Adult']","It’s like this: Ian and Brice and Parker and Dylan get off the bus. They’ve pretended this whole time – just as they’ve pretended for the last three years – not to notice that Rylan has his arm draped casually over the blue plastic bar at the back of my seat. They pretend not to know that the second we get off the bus (scratch that, he’s not even going to wait for that second; it happens before the bus has even come to a complete stop), he’ll lower that arm over my shoulders, or drop his hand forward to f**k with my hair and knuckle my neck a little.  He’s like that: likes touching me in public, holding hands, kissing, and he does it in that easy way of his – with a Rylan-specific brand of confidence that almost makes people around us forget to look twice. Like he knows, as far as I can tell, what the f**k is going on. That is the difference between us. He knows. I don’t.  * * *  A brave and funny love story about the anxieties, insecurities, and heartaches that drive people apart and bring them back together, It’s Like This is the journey of Niles and Rylan, as they learn to communicate in the shadow of a life-changing illness.  Niles and Rylan have been together a long time. They have great sex, they are deeply intimate, and Rylan never holds back on displaying his affection. As far as their family and friends are concerned, they’re an established couple, and yet, after three years of being “together,” Niles is still unsure if they’re actually in a relationship.  As their sexual intensity reaches a dangerous tipping point, Niles must find the courage to articulate how he feels in order to try and keep the only thing he has ever wanted. Emotional and compelling, It’s Like This is a must-read for true romantics.  Note: Please be aware that this is not about a safe, sane, sober and fully consensual BDSM relationship (although it is not non-consensual). It is instead about two people who want what they want but don't know how to express exactly what that is and the emotional repercussions of their miscommunications.",,,01/31/06,July 5th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,9781909192799,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406167001l/22798521.jpg,3.9,[],84.0,1.0,,,,91.0,782.0,202,Beaten Track Publishing,"['242', '312', '159', '49', '20']",,"['Victoria, British Columbia (Canada)']",,"[""Anne O'Gleadra""]"
Interview with the Vampire,,"['Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com",The Vampire Chronicles #1,,04/12/76,08/31/04,"['Lestat de Lioncourt', 'Claudia', 'Daniel Molloy', 'Louis de Pointe du Lac']",Paperback,,9780345476876,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642l/43763.jpg,4.0,['British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1977)'],208415.0,2388.0,,,,93.0,484530.0,342,Ballantine Books,"['180566', '167133', '100554', '26802', '9475']",,"['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)', 'Paris (France)']",,['Anne Rice']

  Pieces of Magic
Remember when you were a child—when all the world was new, and the smallest object a thing of wonder? Arleta Richardson remembers: the funny wearable wire contraption hidden in the dusty attic, the century-old schoolchild's slate that belonged to Grandma, an ancient trunk filled with quilt pieces—each with its own special story—and the button basket, a miracle of mysteries. And best of all was the remarkable grandmother who made magic of all she touched, bringing the past alive as only a born storyteller could.Here are those marvelous tales—faithfully recalled for the delight of young and old alike, a touchstone to another day when life was simpler, perhaps richer; when the treasures of family life and love were passed from generation to generation by a child's questions...and the legends that followed enlarged our faith.Gifted storyteller Arleta Richardson grew up an only child in Chicago, living in a hotel on the shores of Lake Michigan. Under the care of her maternal grandmother, she listened for hours as her grandmother told stories from her own childhood. With unusual recall, Arleta began to write these stories for an audience that now numbers over 2 million.

Illuminations,,"['Poetry', 'France', 'Classics', 'French Literature', '19th Century', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Queer', 'Philosophy', 'LGBT']","The prose poems of the great French Symbolist, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), have acquired enormous prestige among readers everywhere and have been a revolutionary influence on poetry in the twentieth century. They are offered here both in their original texts and in superb English translations by Louise Varèse. Mrs. Varèse first published her versions of Rimbaud’s Illuminations in 1946. Since then she has revised her work and has included two poems which in the interim have been reclassified as part of Illuminations. This edition also contains two other series of prose poems, which include two poems only recently discovered in France, together with an introduction in which Miss Varèse discusses the complicated ins and outs of Rimbaldien scholarship and the special qualities of Rimbaud’s writing. Rimbaud was indeed the most astonishing of French geniuses. Fired in childhood with an ambition to write, he gave up poetry before he was twenty-one. Yet he had already produced some of the finest examples of French verse. He is best known for A Season in Hell, but his other prose poems are no less remarkable. While he was working on them he spoke of his interest in hallucinations––""des vertiges, des silences, des nuits."" These perceptions were caught by the poet in a beam of pellucid, and strangely active language which still lights up––now here, now there––unexplored aspects of experience and thought.",,,10/28/75,January 17th 1957,[],Paperback,,9780811201841,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347626864l/565149.jpg,4.37,[],625.0,8.0,,,,96.0,10597.0,182,New Directions,"['5964', '3045', '1211', '271', '106']",,[],,"['Arthur Rimbaud', 'Louise Varèse']"

But something wasn’t right—beneath the façade of the confident performer, Bassey’s mental health was in a precipitous decline, culminating in a breakdown that resulted in hospitalization and a diagnosis of Bipolar II.Determined to learn from her experiences—and share them with others—Bassey became a mental health advocate and has spent the fourteen years since her diagnosis examining the ways mental health is inextricably intertwined with every facet of ourselves and our lives.

But even though he knows loving Sophie Sullivan isn’t the right thing to do...how can he possibly resist?  Sophie Sullivan, a librarian in San Francisco, was five years old when she fell head over heels in love with Jake McCann. Twenty years later, she’s convinced the notorious bad boy still sees her as the “nice” Sullivan twin. That is, when he bothers to look at her at all. But when they both get caught up in the magic of the first Sullivan wedding, she knows it’s long past time to do whatever it takes to make him see her for who she truly is...the woman who will love him forever.  Jake has always been a magnet for women, especially since his Irish pubs made him extremely wealthy. But the only woman he really wants is the one he can never have. Not only is Sophie his best friend’s off-limits younger sister...he can’t risk letting her get close enough to discover his deeply hidden secret.  Only, when Sophie appears on his doorstep as Jake’s every fantasy come to life—smart, beautiful, and shockingly sexy—he doesn’t have a prayer of taking his eyes, or his hands, off her. And he can’t stop craving more of her sweet smiles and sinful kisses. Because even though Jake knows loving Sophie isn’t the right thing to do...how can he possibly resist?

While many studies have been written on nationalist political movements, the sense of nationality--the personal and cultural feeling of belonging to a nation--has not received proportionate attention. In this widely acclaimed work, Benedict Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the 'imagined communities' of nationality.Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.This revised edition includes two new chapters, one of which discusses the complex role of the colonialist state's mindset in the develpment of Third World nationalism, while the other analyses the processes by which, all over the world, nations came to imagine themselves as old.",,,05/28/83,July 17th 1991,[],Paperback,,9780860915461,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577166498l/399136._SY475_.jpg,4.11,[],287.0,3.0,,,,96.0,11264.0,224,Verso/New Left Books Ltd.,"['4268', '4524', '1998', '369', '105']",,"['South America', 'Asia', 'Africa']",,['Benedict Anderson']

  Alabama, 1947. 

  War's over, cherry-print dresses, parking above the city lights, swing dancing.

  Beautiful, seventeen-year-old Violet lives in a perfect world. Everybody loves her.

  In 2012, she's still beautiful, charming, and surrounded by admirers.
 Veronica ""Ronni"" Johnson, licensed practical nurse and aspiring writer, meets the captivating Violet in the assisted living facility where Violet requires no assistance, just lots of male attention. When she dies, she leaves Ronni a very generous bequest―only if Ronni completes a book about her life within one year. As she's drawn into the world of young Violet, Ronni is mesmerized by life in a simpler time. It's an irresistible journey filled with revelations, some of them about men Ronni knew as octogenarians at Fairfield Springs. Struggling, insecure, flailing at the keyboard, Ronni juggles her patients, a new boyfriend, and a Samsonite factory of emotional baggage as she tries to craft a manuscript before her deadline.But then the secrets start to emerge, some of them in person. And they don't stop.Everything changes.

The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity.Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book.

He was also a French translator of American hard-boiled crime novels. One of his discoveries was an African-American writer by the name of Vernon Sullivan. Vian translated Sullivan's I Spit on Your Graves. The book is about a 'white Negro' who acts out an act of revenge against a small Southern town, in repayment for the death of his brother, who was lynched by an all white mob. Upon its release, I Spit on Your Graves became a bestseller in France, as well as a instruction manual for a copycat killer whose copy of I Spit on Your Graves was found by the murdered body of a prostitute with certain violent passages underlined. A censorship trail also came up where Sullivan as the author was held responsible for the material.

India Black, full-time madam and occasional secret agent, is feeling restless, when one of Disraeli's men calls on her to meet the prime minister--alone. Even though all her previous meetings have been organized by the rakishly handsome spy French, it's been decided this is a mission India must attempt on her own.

It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives.From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and the media, Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women.Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the impact this has on their health and well-being.

Chessy bravely reported her assault to the police and testified against her attacker in court. Then, in the face of unexpected backlash from her once-trusted school community, she shed her anonymity to help other survivors find their voice.This memoir is more than an account of a horrific event.

From the first sentence of her open letter to Osama Bin Laden, Incendiary's unforgettable narrator won't let you go, and her cry of raw outrage at the murder of her family rapidly develops into something very unexpected.

Iron Kingdom,"The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600-1947",History,"In the aftermath of World War II, Prussia--a centuries-old state pivotal to Europe's development--ceased to exist. In their eagerness to erase all traces of the Third Reich from the earth, the Allies believed that Prussia, the very embodiment of German militarism, had to be abolished. But as Christopher Clark reveals in this pioneering history, Prussia's legacy is far more complex. Though now a fading memory in Europe's heartland, the true story of Prussia offers a remarkable glimpse into the dynamic rise of modern Europe. What we find is a kingdom that existed nearly half a millennium ago as a patchwork of territorial fragments, with neither significant resources nor a coherent culture. With its capital in Berlin, Prussia grew from being a small, poor, disregarded medieval state into one of the most vigorous and powerful nations in Europe. Iron Kingdom traces Prussia's involvement in the continent's foundational religious and political conflagrations: from the devastations of the Thirty Years War through centuries of political machinations to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, from the enlightenment of Frederick the Great to the destructive conquests of Napoleon, and from the ""iron and blood"" policies of Bismarck to the creation of the German Empire in 1871, and all that implied for the tumultuous twentieth century. By 1947, Prussia was deemed an intolerable threat to the safety of Europe; what is often forgotten, Clark argues, is that it had also been an exemplar of the European humanistic tradition, boasting a formidable government administration, an incorruptible civil service, and religious tolerance. Clark demonstrates how a state deemed the bane of twentieth-century Europe has played an incalculable role in Western civilization's fortunes. Iron Kingdom is a definitive, gripping account of Prussia's fascinating, influential, and critical role in modern times.",,,,2006.0,,,0674023854,9780674023857,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4LPODzLgDVEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.14,,,,,,,,,776.0,,,2413.0,,,"['Christopher M.

It's Only the Enemy Screaming,,[],"It's Only the Enemy Screaming tells of one man's struggle with faith in the American experiment as the country's first made-for-media war unfolds. Perhaps I would be called upon to fight, I thought. I did not want to go. I did not want to sacrifice my life. I felt remorse for the boys who had already. What would be my family's reaction if I were to go and die? But these are not things to consider if you are in the desert with sand slipping away under your feet, cleaning your gun, smelling the oil, staring in the face of your enemy. The preparations of a warrior do not include doubt. They do not include consideration of the life left behind. The preparations of a warrior consist of absolute commitment, undaunted determination, and complete sobriety. All other considerations are made before the decision to go to war. If they are not, the warrior is doomed. 'It's Only the Enemies Screaming is the emotionally intense story of one man's descent into the psychological underbelly of American culture during the Persian Gulf War. Given our current political climate, McEnroe's edgy narrative of a spectator's view during the first Iraq conflict couldn't be timelier-but his ultimate focus transcends the political moment.

I Am Jonathan Scrivener,,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Classics']","James Wrexham is thirty-nine, lonely, and stuck in a dead-end job when he comes upon an advertisement for a position as secretary to Mr. Jonathan Scrivener. Much to his surprise, he is hired at a lavish salary despite never even meeting Scrivener, and he is told to take up residence at once in the flat of his new employer, who has suddenly disappeared. Mystified by Scrivener’s strange conduct and desperate to learn something about him, it seems Wrexham will get the answers he seeks when Scrivener’s friends begin to visit the flat: Pauline Mandeville, an ethereal beauty, Francesca Bellamy, a widow who may be responsible for the death of her husband, Andrew Middleton, a disillusioned alcoholic, and Antony Rivers, a handsome playboy. But as each of them unfolds his story about Scrivener, it seems that none of them are describing the same person, though all are obsessed with finding him. Why has he hired Wrexham, and why does he seem to have thrust this unlikely group of people together? Is Scrivener engaged in an inscrutable experiment, or could he be laying some kind of trap? Popular in his time for his psychological thrillers, Claude Houghton (1889-1961) was admired by writers as diverse as P. G. Wodehouse, Henry Miller, Hugh Walpole, and Graham Greene, but has fallen into neglect in the past half-century. This new edition restores his masterpiece I Am Jonathan Scrivener (1930) to print and includes Walpole’s introduction from the 1935 edition and an essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning critic and Washington Post columnist Michael Dirda.“So remarkable in truth is this novel that I cannot understand why it is not universally known and admired.” - Hugh Walpole“I Am Jonathan Scrivener remains a tantalizing, highly diverting philosophical novel of rare elegance and wit.” - Michael Dirda",,,11/06/30,April 9th 2013,[],Paperback,,9781939140081,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380984187l/17357393.jpg,4.06,[],60.0,1.0,,,,95.0,112.0,280,Valancourt Books,"['39', '47', '20', '6', '0']",,[],,"['Claude Houghton', 'Michael Dirda', 'Hugh Walpole']"

Interpreting the Parables: God's Good News for the World,,"['Theology', 'New Testament', 'Reference', 'Religion', 'Biblical', 'Christian']","The classic works of C. H. Dodd and Joachim Jeremias set the direction for nearly all further parable studies in this century. Embodied in both scholar's approaches are at least two assumptions that, for the most part, have gone unchallenged: (1) Parables make one and only one main point. (2) They are not allegories. But can these assumptions be supported by the evidence? In this introductory text, Craig Blomberg surveys and evaluates contemporary critical approaches to the parables, challenging the prevailing consensus and making his own important new contribution to parable studies. Within proper definitions and limits, he argues, the parables are in fact best seen as allegories. In support of his thesis, he not only sets forth theoretical considerations but devotes attention to all the major parables, providing brief interpretations that highlight the insights to be gained from his distinctive method. A concluding chapter examines the implications of the parables for Christology and our understanding of the kingdom of God.

Inherit The Whirlwind: The Final Showdown Between Science And Religion,,[],"“Inherit the Whirlwind” features an absorbing courtroom battle of ideologies between two powerful forces hellbent on determining the future of mankind. Set against the backdrop of the trials and tribulations of Professor Joe Colliver, a leading bio-engineer and his tormented family. We are drawn into their troubled world as they get caught up in the unfolding drama and their lives descend into physical and psychological turmoil.  The narrative is carried from the viewpoints of two of the central characters. Ben, the son of Professor Joe Colliver, tells of his struggles to cope with his family’s disintegration and his own battle with depression, suicidal tendencies and the tragic loss of his soulmate and his sister. Jim Wainwright, an investigative journalist, breaks news of the ground-breaking trial to a captivated world-wide audience in a novel format—through the vehicle of regular blog posts.  Science offers humanity the holy grail of extended life and the promise of earthly immortality. While fanatical religious fundamentalists resort to violence and destruction to protect God's divine plan of Creation, traditional religious leaders and institutions take the legal pathway to thwart science’s unholy push to usurp God’s dominion.  A take no prisoners clash between science's push for a brave new world, where man creates his own image against the reactionary forces of religion, clinging to a superstitious past locked in the idea mankind must remain set forever in God's image. The novel is full of memorable characters and dramatic events, with many unforeseeable twists and turns which will surely stay with the reader long after the final page is turned.

But in her 63rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel proves that when two hopelessly mismatched people share a love for art, a passion for each other, and a city like Paris, nothing is truly impossible...or is it?Everything Sasha does is within the boundaries of tradition. Liam is sockless in December. Sasha is widowed, a woman who knows she was lucky enough to be married to the most wonderful man in the world and thankful for every moment they had. Liam is half in and half out of a marriage that only a “wacky” artist could manage, and that his own impossibly impulsive behavior has helped tear apart. But while Sasha has been methodically building her father’s Parisian art gallery into an intercontinental success story, Liam has been growing into one of the most original and striking young painters of his time. So while the two are utterly unalike-–and a nine-year age difference stares them squarely in the face-–the miracle of art brings them crashing together. Now the question is, can Sasha guard her reputation while juggling a secret, somewhat scandalous relationship? And how can Liam, who lives for the moment, put up with a woman who insists on having things her own way, in her own style, and at her own time?For Sasha, it’s a matter of keeping Liam hidden from her grown children and well-heeled clientele as she commutes between New York and Paris and two thriving galleries. For Liam, it’s about creating chaos out of order, bringing out the wild streak that Sasha barely knows she has, of choosing pizza over foie gras, and making love when others are busy making money. That is, until a family tragedy suddenly alters Liam’s life–-and forces a choice and a sacrifice that neither one of them could have expected. But from the snow falling on the Tuileries to the joy of eating ice cream by candlelight, the artist and the art dealer have tasted perfection. And giving up now might just be the most impossible thing of all.With unerring insight into the hearts of men and women–-and into the soul of the artist-–Danielle Steel takes us into a world of glamour and genius, priceless art and dazzling creativity. From the luxurious galleries of Europe to the endless beaches of the Hamptons, Impossible weaves an extraordinary tale of love and compromise, of taking chances and counting blessings.

Inferno,,"['Classics', 'Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Italian Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Medieval']","Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. In the Inferno, Dante not only judges sin but strives to understand it so that the reader can as well. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem’s line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with teachers and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art.Esolen also provides a critical Introduction and endnotes, plus appendices containing Dante’s most important sources—from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians—that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited.",La Divina Commedia #1,,10/28/07,12/09/03,"['Virgilio (Publius Vergilius Maro)', 'Odysseus', 'Dante Alighieri', 'Beatrice (diverse works)', 'Paolo', 'Francesca', 'Charon (mythology)']",Paperback,,9780812970067,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520255019l/15645._SY475_.jpg,4.0,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Poetry (1995)', 'Премія імені Максима Рильського (2015)']",27932.0,380.0,,,,92.0,143016.0,490,Modern Library,"['53836', '48982', '29359', '8035', '2804']",,[],,"['Dante Alighieri', 'Anthony M.

For one of its sons, the hand of violence strikes swiftly, when young Nicolo Borg is seized by Barbary slavers and launched on a remarkable journey to the court of the supreme ruler of the Muslim world. Renamed Asha, plotting his escape even as he swears allegiance to the god of his masters and is schooled in the arts of culture and war, the innocent boy will be transformed into one of the Sultan’s deadliest commanders. For Nico’s beloved sister, Maria, his loss fires her hatred for the knights who did nothing to save him and her dreams of escape from her stifling home. As the headstrong girl grows into a fierce beauty, she will capture the attention of one man in particular, Christien de Vries, a surgeon-knight torn between duty and desire, caught up in Malta’s frantic preparations against the coming Ottoman storm. Around Nico and Maria are men and women who will share their destinies: Dragut Raïs, a brilliant corsair, arch-rival of the knights…Giulio Salvago, a priest in full flight from his carnal nature…Alisa, a young beauty hidden away in a harem…Jean de La Valette, the master knight who is Malta’s only hope for survival.As the mighty Ottoman fleet bears down on the tiny island, as Nico Borg makes his way back to his homeland at the helm of a warship, Ironfire moves inexorably to a shattering climax where all will face ultimate justice in the murderous cauldron of siege warfare. Brilliantly capturing the crosscurrents of a storied age, Ironfire is historical fiction in the grand tradition, a stirring realization of a pivotal moment in time that irrevocably shaped the world we inhabit today.",,,,December 30th 2003,[],Hardcover,,9780385336017,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440229880l/970556.jpg,4.3,[],98.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1314.0,688,Delacorte Press,"['653', '459', '156', '29', '17']",,[],,['David Ball']
Is That a Fish in Your Ear? Translation and the Meaning of Everything,,"['Nonfiction', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Science', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Reference', 'Unfinished', 'Literary Criticism', 'Literature']","Funny and surprising on every page, Is That a Fish in Your Ear? offers readers new insight into the mystery of how we come to know what someone else means—whether we wish to understand Astérix cartoons or a foreign head of state. Using translation as his lens, David Bellos shows how much we can learn about ourselves by exploring the ways we use translation, from the historical roots of written language to the stylistic choices of Ingmar Bergman, from the United Nations General Assembly to the significance of James Cameron's Avatar.Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across human experience to describe why translation sits deep within us all, and why we need it in so many situations, from the spread of religion to our appreciation of literature; indeed, Bellos claims that all writers are by definition translators. Written with joie de vivre, reveling both in misunderstanding and communication, littered with wonderful asides, it promises any reader new eyes through which to understand the world. In the words of Bellos: ""The practice of translation rests on two presuppositions. The first is that we are all different: we speak different tongues, and see the world in ways that are deeply influenced by the particular features of the tongue that we speak. The second is that we are all the same—that we can share the same broad and narrow kinds of feelings, information, understandings, and so forth. Without both of these suppositions, translation could not exist. Nor could anything we would like to call social life. Translation is another name for the human condition.""",,,,October 25th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9781846144646,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328172423l/11431000.jpg,3.78,"['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Criticism (2011)', 'Susanne K.

His monumental, unsettling images have an extraordinary power to disturb, shock, and haunt the spectator, ""to unlock the valves of feeling and therefore return the onlooker to life more violently"".Eminent writer and curator David Sylvester provides the definitive account of the career of an artist whose friend and collaborator he was for more than forty years. Drawing on his unparalleled personal knowledge of Bacon's inspirations and intentions, he first offers a critical overview of the development of Bacon's work from 1933 to the early 1990s, and then addresses its crucial aspects. Sylvester also reproduces previously unpublished extracts from his celebrated conversations with Bacon in which the artist speaks about himself, modern painters, and the art of the past. Finally, he gives a brief account of Bacon's life, correcting errors that elsewhere have been presented as facts.Accompanying the incisive and revealing text are reproductions of almost every Bacon work discussed, including twelve triptych fold-outs.

In The Year Of Long Division: Stories,,['Short Stories'],"Dawn Raffel's debut delivers us to the wild spaces of a youth in the Midwest and to the blank terrors of the heart. There is a cold wind blowing through these stories, whose sentences come to us as a rebuke to anything felt. In her flight from sentiment, Raffel masterfully reifies the new will to absence that marks the moral and emotional bearing of her generation. The result is not just an acknowledgment of all our long divisions - the divide between impulse and the means to apprehend it, between desire and entrapment - but of the final sweet concession that we must each of us make to the futility of even the smallest mending. In the Year of Long Division gives us the triumph of craft over the obstinance of expression and the installation of a writer certain to be cited in the continuing reinvention of the American short story.",,,,January 31st 1995,[],Hardcover,,9780679415817,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1186641051l/1616126.jpg,3.98,[],84.0,1.0,,,,85.0,62.0,117,Knopf,"['27', '20', '6', '5', '4']",,[],,['Dawn Raffel']

In Youth is Pleasure & I Left My Grandfather's House,,"['Fiction', 'Coming Of Age', 'Queer', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'China', 'Classics', 'Art']","First published in 1945, ""In Youth Is Pleasure"" is a beautiful and unassuming coming-of-age novel by the English writer and painter Denton Welch (1915-1948). Painfully sensitive and sad Orville Pym is 15 years old, and this novel recounts the summer holiday after his first miserable year at public school--but as in all of Welch's work, what is most important are the details of his characters' surroundings. Welch is a Proustian writer of uncanny powers of observation who, as William S. Burroughs wrote, ""makes the reader aware of the magic that is right under his eyes."" Film director John Waters includes this novel as one of his ""Five Books You Should Read to Live a Happy Life If Something Is Basically the Matter with You,"" and writes: ""Maybe there is no better novel in the world than Denton Welch's ""In Youth Is Pleasure."" Just holding it in my hands, so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger."" Also included in this edition is the first U.S. publication of ""I Left My Grandfather's House.""

Interweaving the stories of survivors, Doug Stanton has brought this astonishing human drama to life in a narrative that is at once immediate and timeless. The definitive account of a little-known chapter in World War II history, In Harm's Way is destined to become a classic tale of war, survival, and extraordinary courage.On July 30, 1945, the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed in the South Pacific by a Japanese submarine. An estimated 300 men were killed upon impact; close to 900 sailors were cast into the Pacific Ocean, where they remained undetected by the navy for nearly four days and nights. Battered by a savage sea, they struggled to stay alive, fighting off sharks, hypothermia, and dementia. The captain's subsequent court-martial left many questions unanswered: How did the navy fail to realize the Indianapolis was missing? And perhaps most amazing of all, how did these 317 men manage to survive?",,,01/01/01,May 1st 2003,[],Paperback,,9780805073669,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442540445l/42435._SY475_.jpg,4.3,['Audie Award for History/Biography (2017)'],193.0,3.0,,,,97.0,18961.0,339,Owl Books,"['9364', '6722', '2306', '371', '198']",,[],,['Doug Stanton']

I Am a Strange Loop,,"['Philosophy', 'Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Mathematics', 'Neuroscience', 'Brain', 'Popular Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Physics']","What do we mean when we say ""I""? Can thought arise out of matter? Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an ""I"" arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? I Am a Strange Loop argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is the ""strange loop""--a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a human brain is a chaotic seething soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we call ""symbols."" The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is the one we both call ""I."" The ""I"" is the nexus in our brain where the levels feed back into each other and flip causality upside down, with symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. For each human being, this ""I"" seems to be the realest thing in the world. But how can such a mysterious abstraction be real--or is our ""I"" merely a convenient fiction? Does an ""I"" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the all-powerful laws of physics? These are the mysteries tackled in I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas R. Hofstadter's first book-length journey into philosophy since Godel, Escher, Bach.

It's So Easy: And Other Lies,,"['Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Musicians', 'Rock N Roll', 'Pop Culture', 'Audiobook']","A founding member of Guns N’ Roses and Velvet Revolver shares the story of his rise to the pinnacle of fame and fortune, his struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction, his personal crash and burn, and his phoenix-like transformation via a unique path to sobriety. In 1984, at the age of twenty, Duff McKagan left his native Seattle—partly to pursue music but mainly to get away from a host of heroin overdoses then decimating his closest group of friends in the local punk scene. In L.A. only a few weeks and still living in his car, he answered a want ad for a bass player placed by someone who identified himself only as “Slash.” Soon after, the most dangerous band in the world was born. Guns N’ Roses went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. In It's So Easy, Duff recounts GN’R’s unlikely trajectory to a string of multiplatinum albums, sold-out stadium concerts, and global acclaim. But that kind of glory can take its toll, and it did—ultimately—on Duff, as well as on the band itself. As GN’R began to splinter, Duff felt that he himself was done, too. But his near death as a direct result of alcoholism proved to be his watershed, the turning point that led to his unique path to sobriety and the unexpected choices he has made for himself since. In a voice that is as honest as it is indelibly his own, Duff—one of rock’s smartest and most articulate personalities—takes readers on his harrowing journey through the dark heart of one of the most notorious bands in rock-and-roll history and out the other side.",,First Edition,,October 4th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9781451606638,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787060l/11156963.jpg,4.2,[],198.0,2.0,,,,96.0,9357.0,366,Touchstone,"['4068', '3557', '1389', '238', '105']",,[],,['Duff McKagan']

Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. In this astonishing book, Ed Yong takes us on a grand tour through our microbial partners, and introduces us to the scientists on the front lines of discovery. Yong, whose humor is as evident as his erudition, prompts us to look at ourselves and our animal companions in a new light—less as individuals and more as the interconnected, interdependent multitudes we assuredly are. The microbes in our bodies are part of our immune systems and protect us from disease. Those in cows and termites digest the plants they eat. In the deep oceans, mysterious creatures without mouths or guts depend on microbes for all their energy. Bacteria provide squids with invisibility cloaks, help beetles to bring down forests, and allow worms to cause diseases that afflict millions of people. I Contain Multitudes is the story of these extraordinary partnerships, between the creatures we are familiar with and those we are not. It reveals how we humans are disrupting these partnerships and how we might manipulate them for our own good.

In a vibrant novel which depicts both the beauty and the cruelty of the time and place, Elizabeth Borton de Treviño tells the story of Juan, who was born a slave and died an accomplished and respected artist.Upon the death of his indulgent mistress in Seville, Juan de Pareja was uprooted from the only home he had known and placed in the charge of a vicious gypsy muleteer to be sent north to his mistress's nephew and heir, Diego Velázquez, who recognized at once the intelligence and gentle breeding which were to make Juan his indispensable assistant and companion—and his lifelong friend.Through Juan's eyes the reader sees Velázquez's delightful family, his working habits and the character of the man, his relations with the shy yet devoted King Philip IV and with his fellow painters, Rubens and Murillo, the climate and customs of Spanish court life. When Velázquez discovers that he and Juan share a love for the art which is his very life, the painter proves his friendship in the most incredible fashion, for in those days it was forbidden by law for slaves to learn or practice the arts.

His candid memoirs offer a unique eyewitness account of events leading up to and during the war, culminating in those dark final days in the Fuhrer's headquarters, deep under the shattered city of Berlin.He begins by describing his duties as a member of Hitler's personal staff in the years preceding the war, driving the Fuhrer throughout Germany and abroad, and accompanying him to rallies. The crux of his memoirs however covers his life with Hitler in the Berlin Fuhrerbunker. During this time he was responsible for a transport fleet of cars, and often drove the likes of Speer or Kesselring on inspection tours to the hot spots on the front; and in March 1945, he accompanied the Fuhrer to his final front-inspection tour. Kempka was also present when news came through of Goring and Himmler's efforts to seize power and negotiate a truce with the Western Allies.Crucially, Kempka also witnessed Hitler's marriage to Eva Braun, and his last dinner and personal farewell to all those present, before he and his wife committed suicide. Hitler's final order to Kempka was that he have ready enough petrol to burn him and his wife. Under constant Soviet artillery fire, Kempke, Linge and others poured petrol over the bodies and burnt them.The account concludes with Kempka's hazardous escape out of a burning Berlin more than 800 km through enemy-occupied Germany, home to find his wife at BE.

Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.",,,,May 10th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780307408846,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327864303l/9938498.jpg,3.85,"['Washington State Book Award for History/General Nonfiction (2012)', 'Chautauqua Prize Nominee (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)']",427.0,6.0,,,,93.0,160937.0,448,Crown,"['42308', '66285', '40355', '9310', '2679']",,['Berlin (Germany)'],,['Erik Larson']

Mere hours later, Galveston found itself submerged in a monster hurricane that completely destroyed the town and killed over six thousand people in what remains the greatest natural disaster in American history--and Isaac Cline found himself the victim of a devastating personal tragedy.Using Cline's own telegrams, letters, and reports, the testimony of scores of survivors, and our latest understanding of the science of hurricanes, Erik Larson builds a chronicle of one man's heroic struggle and fatal miscalculation in the face of a storm of unimaginable magnitude.

Rich with the uncanny sense of life and action characteristic of his writing — from his earliest stories (In Our Time) to his last novella (The Old Man and the Sea) — this compelling novel contains both the warmth of recollection that inspired A Moveable Feast and a rare glimpse of Hemingway's rich and relaxed sense of humor, which enlivens scene after scene.  Beginning in the 1930s, Islands in the Stream follows the fortunes of Thomas Hudson from his experiences as a painter on the Gulf Stream island of Bimini, where his loneliness is broken by the vacation visit of his three young sons, to his antisubmarine activities off the coast of Cuba during World War II. The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters — including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations — engages in incomparably rich dialogue.

Moving through a world of topics and emotions, these voices are fierce, alive, tender, complicated, imaginative, and smart. Girls today often find themselves in a struggle between remaining strong and true to themselves and conforming to society’s expectations in an attempt to please. They are taught not to be too intense, too passionate, too smart, too caring, too open. They are encouraged to shut down their instincts, their outrage, their desires and their dreams, to be polite, to obey the rules. I Am an Emotional Creature is a celebration of the authentic voice inside every girl and an inspiring call to action for girls everywhere to speak up, follow their dreams, and become the women they were always meant to be.Among the girls Ensler creates are an American who struggles with peer pressure in a suburban high school; an anorexic blogging as she eats less and less; a Masai girl from Kenya unwilling to endure female genital mutilation; a Bulgarian sex slave, no more than fifteen, a Chinese factory worker making Barbies; an Iranian student who is tricked into a nose job; a pregnant girl trying to decide if she should keep her baby.Through rants, poetry, questions, and facts, we come to understand the universality of girls everywhere: their resiliency, their wildness, their pain, their fears, their secrets, and their triumphs.

I Am One of You Forever,,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Southern', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Coming Of Age', 'Family']","Wonderfully funny and also deeply touching, I Am One of You Forever is the story of a young boy's coming of age. Set in the hills and hollows of western North Carolina in the years around World War II, it tells of ten-year-old Jess and his family -- father, mother, grandmother, foster brother, and an odd assortment of other relatives -- who usher Jess into the adult world, with all its attendant joys and sorrows, knowledge and mystery.Jess's father is feisty, restless, and fun-loving. His mother is straitlaced and serious but accepts with grace and good humor the antics of the men of the family, a trait she learned from her own mother. Johnson Gibbs is the orphaned teenager who comes to live with them on their mountain farm. Life on the laurel-covered mountain is isolated and at times difficult, but for Jess it is made rich and remarkable through his relationship with his father and, especially, Johnson Gibbs.Visiting the farm from time to time is a gallery of eccentric relatives who are surely among the most memorable creations in recent fiction. Uncle Luden is a womanizer who left the mountains years ago for a job in California that ""paid actual cash money."" Uncle Gurton has a spooky way of appearing and disappearing without ever seeming to enter or exit, but it is his flowing beard, which he has apparently never trimmed and which he keeps tucked inside his overalls, that is of most fascination to Jess.Uncle Zeno is a storyteller. With the words ""That puts me in mind of..."" everyone around knows that he is about to launch into another of his endless tales. Uncle Runkin, who always brings his handmade coffin to sleep in whenever he visits, spends his time carving intricate designs into the coffin and trying to find just the right epitaph for his tombstone. Aunt Samantha Barefoot stops by for a brief spell, too. A country singer and cousin to Jess's grandmother, she is a woman of uncensored speech (Jess learns a lot from her) and honest emotions. Chappell tells the story of all of these characters in a series of chapters that range from fantasy and near farce to pathos. As notable for its lyrical descriptions of the rural settings as for its finely honed vernacular dialogue, I Am One of You Forever shows us a world full of wit and wisdom and the sadness at the heart of things.

Insights,Talks on the Nature of Existence,Spiritual life,"In 1983, when Rama - Dr. Frederick P. Lenz recorded a series of profound and powerful talks entitled Insights: Talks on the Nature of Existence. This book is a transcript of those talks. Rama was instructing an ever-growing number of students. Dr. Lenz himself was developing an approach to self-realization that, while emphasizing meditation and enlightenment, drew from a variety of traditions including Vedanta, Tibetan Buddhism and the American mystic teachings described by Carlos Castaneda. The Insights talks, which evolved from this time period, are like a crest jewel of Dr. Lenz's body of teachings. It is interesting to note that most of the Insights talks are subtitled ""Modular Mysticism"" (for example, ""Modular Mysticism: The Truth""). Even the talk titled ""How to Make Friends with God"" - discussed in depth only in this series - is termed a part of ""Modular Mysticism."" In the practice of mysticism, Dr. Lenz explains, the student begins to understand awareness and power. Modular mysticism becomes the science of power, and the student learns to gain power, to stop losing power, to store power, and eventually to give power to others. In order to gain power, the student begins to lead an efficient and well-structured life. As the student accomplishes this, they are able to move more easily through the doorways to enlightenment. At each step along the journey of the Insights talks, Dr. Lenz gives specific examples of how to adapt and integrate mystical Buddhist practice into a Western lifestyle. For Dr. Lenz there was no contradiction between being a successful Westerner and a successful Buddhist, be it building a career, working out at the health club, going to the movies, shopping for clothes -- or understanding why more women don't attain enlightenment (when, in fact, it's easier for them to do so). In every instance, Dr. Lenz connects the heights of the mystical experiences directly to our everyday lives.",,,,2003.0,,,1932206086,9781932206081,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NOX2PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5.0,,,,,,,,,304.0,,,1.0,,,['Frederick Lenz']

In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Science', 'Mental Health', 'Self Help', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Social Work', 'Memoir']","He would probably dispute it, but Gabor Maté is something of a compassion machine. Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Maté never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Maté observes, ""Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves."" In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Maté's most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Maté looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such catastrophe on themselves.Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril.

In Europa,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Historical', 'Society', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'War', '20th Century', 'Unfinished']","Verschenen in 2004 - Geert Mak reisde met de twintigste eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl.Wat heeft een straatarme, tandeloze bejaarde in een afgelegen, vervallen dorpje in Roemenië gemeen met de bewoner van een Hollandse nieuwbouwwijk, hybride auto voor de deur, golfset in de gang? Niet veel – maar ze wonen wel allebei in een land dat deel uitmaakt van Europa. Binnen de grenzen van dat continent lijken de verschillende tijdlagen soms als kruiend ijs over elkaar te schuiven: de ene plaats geeft je het gevoel dat de tijd heeft stilgestaan, op andere plekken vallen de vernieuwingen niet bij te benen.In 1999, vlak voordat er weer een hoofdstuk van een eeuw Europa ten einde zou gaan, maakte Geert Mak in opdracht van NRCHandelsblad een reis door die oude wereld. Zijn doel: ‘een soort eindinspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het slot van de twintigste eeuw?’ Tegelijk was het een ‘historische reis’: ‘ik volgde, voor zover mogelijk, de loop van de geschiedenis, op zoek naar sporen die waren achtergebleven.’ De inhoudsopgave van het boek bestaat uit een indrukwekkende lijst plaatsen waar geschiedenis is geschreven: Verdun, Ieper, Berlijn, Predappio, Leningrad, Vichy, Neurenberg, Lourdes, Tsjernobyl en Novi Sad, om er een paar te noemen. Overal bezocht Mak plaatsen van herinnering, hij dook in archieven en sprak met schrijvers, historici, filosofen, politici, verzetslieden en militairen, maar ook met hele gewone mensen die over hun leven vertelden. Al die gesprekken, al die documenten, al die boeken, ze hebben geleid tot een imposant verhaal over een eeuw Europa, een werelddeel dat wel één naam draagt maar nooit echt een eenheid was. En hoe kan het anders, gezien de totaal verschillende culturen binnen de grenzen ervan en het gegeven dat het gelijktijdige zo ongelijk kan zijn – niet lang geleden nog heel schrijnend, toen er in Joegoslavië, op twee uurtjes vliegen afstand van het kalme, nijvere Nederland, een burgeroorlog uitbrak.De twintigste eeuw is verleden tijd, geschiedenis. Er woedden oorlogen, de Muur viel, er kwam een Europese munt. In de machtige studie die In Europa is, maken we het allemaal nog een keer mee, vaak via verhalen uit de eerste hand, via ooggetuigenverslagen. Dat het daarbij lijkt dat de chaos toeneemt naarmate we het heden naderen, maakt deel uit van de paradox van de geschiedenis: hoe verder een tijdvak uit het zicht verdwijnt, hoe scherper het beeld zich toont. Maks boek is een fascinerend mozaïek van verhalen en geschiedenissen, waar we later, op grotere afstand, misschien heel nieuwe patronen in zullen ontwaren.`Begin 1999 verliet ik Amsterdam voor een reis door Europa die een vol jaar zou duren. Het was een soort laatste inspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het eind van de twintigste eeuw? Maar het was ook een historische reis: ik volgde letterlijk de sporen van de geschiedenis, door de eeuw en door het continent, beginnend in januari, bij de resten van de Parijse Wereldtentoonstelling en het bruisende Wenen, eindigend in december, in de ruïnes van Sarajevo.Dat hele jaar reisde ik zo met de eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl. En ik praatte met de getuigen: met schrijvers en politici, met verzetsmensen en hoge offi cie ren, met een boer in de Pyreneeën en met de kleinzoon van de Duitse keizer, tientallen Europeanen die hun verhaal op tafel legden.Dit reisverslag gaat over het verleden, en wat het verleden met ons doet.

"In the Forest of Faded Wisdom: 104 Poems by Gendun Chopel, a Bilingual Edition",,"['Poetry', 'Buddhism']","In a culture where poetry is considered the highest form of human language, Gendun Chopel is revered as Tibet’s greatest modern poet. Born in 1903 as British troops were preparing to invade his homeland, Gendun Chopel was identified at any early age as the incarnation of a famous lama and became a Buddhist monk, excelling in the debating courtyards of the great monasteries of Tibet. At the age of thirty-one, he gave up his monk’s vows and set off for India, where he would wander, often alone and impoverished, for over a decade. Returning to Tibet, he was arrested by the government of the young Dalai Lama on trumped-up charges of treason, emerging from prison three years later a broken man. He died in 1951 as troops of the People’s Liberation Army marched into Lhasa.Throughout his life, from his childhood to his time in prison, Gendun Chopel wrote poetry that conveyed the events of his remarkable life. In the Forest of Faded Wisdom is the first comprehensive collection of his oeuvre in any language, assembling poems in both the original Tibetan and in English translation. A master of many forms of Tibetan verse, Gendun Chopel composed heartfelt hymns to the Buddha, pithy instructions for the practice of the dharma, stirring tributes to the Tibetan warrior-kings, cynical reflections on the ways of the world, and laments of a wanderer, forgotten in a foreign land. These poems exhibit the technical skill—wordplay, puns, the ability to evoke moods of pathos and irony—for which Gendun Chopel was known and reveal the poet to be a consummate craftsman, skilled in both Tibetan and Indian poetics. With a directness and force often at odds with the conventions of belles lettres, this is a poetry that is at once elegant and earthy. In the Forest of Faded Wisdom is a remarkable introduction to Tibet’s sophisticated poetic tradition and its most intriguing twentieth-century writer.",,,06/15/09,November 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780226104522,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348208062l/6085994.jpg,4.11,[],86.0,1.0,,,,94.0,18.0,199,University of Chicago Press,"['8', '5', '4', '1', '0']",,[],,"['Gendün Chöphel', 'Donald S.

"Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power and Lies",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Science', 'American History', 'The United States Of America']","Americans call Niagara Falls a natural wonder, but the Falls aren't very natural anymore. In fact, they are a study in artifice. Water diverted, riverbed reshaped, brink stabilized and landscape redesigned, the Falls are more a monument to man's meddling than to nature's strength. Held up as an example of something real, they are hemmed in with fakery -- waxworks, haunted houses, IMAX films and ersatz Indian tales. A symbol of American manifest destiny, they are shared politely with Canada. Emblem of nature's power, they are completely human-controlled. Archetype of natural beauty, they belie an ugly environmental legacy still bubbling up from below. On every level, Niagara Falls is a monument to how America falsifies nature, reshaping its contours and redirecting its force while claiming to submit to its will.Combining history, reportage and personal narrative, ""Inventing Niagara"" traces Niagara's journey from sublime icon to engineering marvel to camp spectacle. Along the way, Ginger Strand uncovers the hidden history of America's waterfall: the Mohawk chief who wrested the Falls from his adopted tribe, the revered town father who secretly assisted slave catchers, the wartime workers who unknowingly helped build the Bomb and the building contractor who bought and sold a pharaoh. With an uncanny ability to zero in on the buried truth, Strand introduces us to underwater dams, freaks of nature, mythical maidens and 280,000 radioactive mice buried at Niagara.From LaSalle to Lincoln to Los Alamos, Mohawks to Marilyn, Niagara's story is America's story, a tale of dreams founded on the mastery of nature.

Even before Sargent painted her portrait, Virginie's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of vicious Paris gossip.

A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes an improper joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen.

If a novelist's first duty is to tell the truth, then the author has done his duty with unflinching courage. Intimacy gives us the thoughts and memories of a middle-aged writer on the night before he walks out on his wife and two young sons for of a younger woman. A very modern man, without political convictions or religious beliefs, he vaguely hopes to find fulfillment in sexual love. No one is spared Kureishi's cold, penetrating gaze or lacerating pen. ""She thinks she's feminist, but she's just bad-tempered,"" the unnamed narrator says of his abandoned wife. A male friend advises him, ""Marriage is a battle, a terrible journey, a season in hell, and a reason for living."" At the heart of Intimacy is this terrible paradox: ""You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them."" Male readers will wince with recognition at the narrator's hatred of entrapment and domesticity, and his implacable urge towards freedom, escape, even loneliness. Female readers may find it a truly horrific revelation. Kureishi is only telling it like it is, in staccato sentences of pinpoint accuracy. By far the author's best yet: a brilliant, devastating work. --Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk",,,10/29/98,2001,[],,,9783499231933,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172250332l/153418.jpg,3.56,[],194.0,2.0,,,,85.0,3966.0,252,Rowohlt-Taschenbuch-Verlag,"['779', '1393', '1208', '437', '149']",,[],,['Hanif Kureishi']

""In Broad Daylight"" tells the story of the killing of Ken Rex McElroy on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri in July 1981. McElroy, an illiterate hog farmer, had terrorized all of northwest Missouri for over 20 years, until the town, and even law enforcement, was terrified of him. McElroy was shot as he sat in his truck in front of the tavern. Over 45 men witnessed the shooting. Despite two eyewitness accounts and three grand jury investigations, no one has been prosecuted for the crime. ""In Broad Daylight"" won an Edgar Award for Best True Crime. It was also made into a movie starring Brian Denehey, Cloris Leachman and Chris Cooper. It was re-released as an e-book on Amazon July 2012 on the 31st anniversary of the killing. St. Martin's Press published the last print edition in 2006.In ""The Story Behind 'In Broad Daylight,'"" MacLean tells how he researched and wrote the book. He tells of guns being drawn on him, being bitten by a dog, and a confrontation with the killer on the killer's ranch. In addition to updates on characters from the book (including who is still alive and who has died), the book answers many questions about the killing itself, such as who was involved, and what has become of them. MacLean describes the breakthrough events when key characters agreed to speak with him, and he realized he would finally get the story. The author also discusses the nature of the moral consequences of the killing for the town and those involved in the crime. The mini-book contains never-before published photographs of some of the principal characters, including the killer.

The treatments of the role of women in ""A Doll House""; of family guilt in ""Ghosts; "" of sexuality in ""Rosmersholm; "" of the individual vs. society in ""An Ememy of the People; "" of the equally potent and poignant themes of the other plays - all continue to strike live nerve-endings of contemporary concern and sensibility.

Integrity: The Courage to Meet the Demands of Reality,,"['Leadership', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Christian', 'Audiobook', 'Faith', 'Christian Living']","Integrity. It is more than simple honesty. It's the key to success. A person with integrity has the -- often rare -- ability to pull everything together, to make it all happen no matter how challenging the circumstances.Drawing on experiences from his work with Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, and individual leaders, Dr. Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist and nationally syndicated radio host, shows how our character can keep us from achieving all we want to (or could) be.In Integrity, Dr. Cloud explores the six qualities of character that define integrity. He uses stories from well-known business leaders like Michael Dell and sports figures like Tiger Woods to illustrate each of these qualities. He shows us how people with integrity:Are able to connect with others and build trust Are oriented toward reality Finish well Embrace the negative Are oriented toward increase Have an understanding of the transcendentSuccess is not related to only talent or brains. There are a lot of bright, talented people who are never successful. And the most successful are not only the ones with the most talent. The real factor, Cloud demonstrates, is the makeup of the person. All of us can grow in the kinds of real character that bring about fruitful relationships and achievement of purpose, mission, and goals. Integrity is not something that you either have or don't, but instead is an exciting growth path that all of us can engage in and enjoy.",,,11/05/06,February 7th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9780060849689,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349055690l/437261.jpg,4.23,[],94.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2569.0,304,Harper Business,"['1261', '802', '370', '104', '32']",,[],,['Henry Cloud']

Nine-year-old Suleiman’s days are circumscribed by the narrow rituals of childhood: outings to the ruins surrounding Tripoli, games with friends played under the burning sun, exotic gifts from his father’s constant business trips abroad. But his nights have come to revolve around his mother’s increasingly disturbing bedside stories full of old family bitterness. And then one day Suleiman sees his father across the square of a busy marketplace, his face wrapped in a pair of dark sunglasses. Wasn’t he supposed to be away on business yet again? Why is he going into that strange building with the green shutters? Why did he lie? Suleiman is soon caught up in a world he cannot hope to understand—where the sound of the telephone ringing becomes a portent of grave danger; where his mother frantically burns his father’s cherished books; where a stranger full of sinister questions sits outside in a parked car all day; where his best friend’s father can disappear overnight, next to be seen publicly interrogated on state television.

Those cartoons eventually led to a popular blog-gapingvoid.com-and a reputation for pithy insight and humor, in both words and pictures.MacLeod has opinions on everything from marketing to the meaning of life, but one of his main subjects is creativity. How do new ideas emerge in a cynical, risk-averse world? Where does inspiration come from? What does it take to make a living as a creative person?Ignore Everybody expands on MacLeod's sharpest insights, wittiest cartoons, and most useful advice. For example:-Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.-If your plan depends on you suddenly being ""discovered"" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. Nobody suddenly discovers anything. Things are made slowly and in pain.-Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.-The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours.

As the war progressed, the soldiers of two countries stripped her of all she loved -- her family, her home, her innocence -- but the degradations only strengthened her will.She began to fight back.

Eppure, alla vigilia del matrimonio, Pierre decide di infrangere quella invisibile ma solida barriera «fatta di buon sangue, di carni robuste e sane e di risparmi investiti in titoli di Stato, una barriera destinata a proteggere per sempre i giovani dalle insidie della sorte e dalle loro stesse passioni», e la legge non scritta per la quale di generazione in generazione accoppiamenti giudiziosi stringono sempre di più i legami tra le poche famiglie che contano della ricca borghesia di provincia – e sposa la donna che ama. Comincia così «il grande romanzo classico» di Irène Némirovsky: trenta capitoli in cui, attraverso la storia degli Hardelot, si percorrono trent’anni di storia francese, da quelli che precedettero la prima guerra mondiale a quelli che vedono (nel momento stesso in cui Irène racconta gli eventi mentre stanno accadendo) l’occupazione della Francia da parte dei tedeschi. E qui – nelle pagine conclusive del romanzo, allorché si compiono i destini dei personaggi che ha seguito con il suo sguardo affettuoso e ironico – Irène Némirovsky ci stupisce ancora una volta, dimostrando (esattamente come in Suite francese, la cui stesura portava avanti in parallelo, e di cui I doni della vita si può considerare una sorta di prova generale) una lucidità quasi profetica su quelli che saranno i destini dell’umanità tutta.",,Biblioteca Adelphi #536,11/06/47,March 1st 2009,[],Paperback,,9788845923616,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1326235854l/9652143.jpg,3.9,[],79.0,1.0,,,,95.0,1948.0,218,Adelphi,"['474', '907', '478', '72', '17']",,[],,"['Irène Némirovsky', 'Laura Frausin Guarino']"

Non sarà difficile, in effetti, riconoscere nella piccola Hélène, che siede a tavola dritta e composta per evitare gli aspri rimproveri della madre, la stessa Irène; e nella bella donna che a cena sfoglia le riviste di moda appena arrivate da Parigi in quella noiosa cittadina dell'impero russo – che trascura una figlia poco amata per il giovane cugino, oggetto invece di una furente passione – quella Fanny Némirovsky che ha fatto dell'infanzia di Irène un deserto senza amore. Hélène detesta la madre con tutte le sue forze (e si sente morire all'idea di dover posare la bocca su quella guancia che vorrebbe «lacerare con le unghie»), al punto da sostituirne il nome, nelle preghiere serali, con quello dell'amata istitutrice, «con una vaga speranza omicida». Verrà un giorno, però, in cui la madre comincerà a invecchiare, e Hélène avrà diciott'anni: accadrà a Parigi, dove la famiglia si è stabilita dopo la guerra e la rivoluzione di ottobre e la fuga attraverso le vaste pianure gelate della Russia e della Finlandia, durante la quale l'adolescente ha avuto per la prima volta «la consapevolezza del suo potere di donna». Allora sembrerà giunto alfine per lei il momento della vendetta: «Ti farò piangere come tu hai fatto piangere me!». Ma Hélène non è sua madre – e forse sceglierà una strada diversa: quella di una solitudine «aspra e inebriante».

It is the sixteenth century, the beginning of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and when her shiftless husband disappears to the New World, Inés uses the opportunity to search for him as an excuse to flee her stifling homeland and seek adventure. After her treacherous journey takes her to Peru, she learns that her husband has died in battle. Soon she begins a fiery love affair with a man who will change the course of her life: Pedro de Valdivia, war hero and field marshal to the famed Francisco Pizarro.Valdivia's dream is to succeed where other Spaniards have failed: to become the conquerer of Chile. The natives of Chile are fearsome warriors, and the land is rumored to be barren of gold, but this suits Valdivia, who seeks only honor and glory. Together the lovers Inés Suárez and Pedro de Valdivia will build the new city of Santiago, and they will wage a bloody, ruthless war against the indigenous Chileans—the fierce local Indians led by the chief Michimalonko, and the even fiercer Mapuche from the south. The horrific struggle will change them forever, pulling each of them toward their separate destinies.Inés of My Soul is a work of breathtaking scope: meticulously researched, it engagingly dramatizes the known events of Inés Suárez's life, crafting them into a novel full of the narrative brilliance and passion readers have come to expect from Isabel Allende.",,,09/05/06,November 7th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9780061161537,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440985143l/3300._SX318_.jpg,3.94,[],802.0,10.0,,,,93.0,22318.0,321,Harper,"['6976', '8758', '5132', '1159', '293']",,"['Peru (Perú) (Peru)', 'Chile']",,"['Isabel Allende', 'Margaret Sayers Peden']"

Though her childhood is one of brutality and fear, Tété finds solace in the traditional rhythms of African drums and in the voodoo loas she discovers through her fellow slaves.  When twenty-year-old Toulouse Valmorain arrives on the island in 1770, it’s with powdered wigs in his baggage and dreams of financial success in his mind. But running his father’s plantation, Saint-Lazare, is neither glamorous nor easy. It will be eight years before he brings home a bride -- but marriage, too, proves more difficult than he imagined. And Valmorain remains dependent on the services of his teenaged slave. Spanning four decades, Island Beneath the Sea is the moving story of the intertwined lives of Tété and Valmorain, and of one woman’s determination to find love amid loss, to offer humanity though her own has been battered, and to forge her own identity in the cruellest of circumstances.Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden.",,,08/25/09,April 27th 2010,"['Jean Lafitte', 'Zarité Sedella', 'Toulouse Valmorain', 'Violette Boisier', 'Sancho García del Solar', 'Maurice Valmorain', 'Rosette Sedella', 'Tante Rose', 'Dr. Parmentier', 'Loula']",Hardcover,,9780061988240,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501991943l/7005479.jpg,4.06,[],191.0,2.0,,,,95.0,33170.0,457,Harper,"['11569', '13825', '6217', '1260', '299']",,['Saint-Domingue (Haiti)'],,"['Isabel Allende', 'Margaret Sayers Peden']"

Protagonista è un ragazzino, Pin, che vive in un clima di privazioni e confusione, nel periodo della Resistenza. Avendo rubato una pistola a un soldato tedesco, Pin decide di nasconderla in un sentiero sperduto, per lui quasi magico, dove i ragni fanno il nido. Il bambino entra poi in un gruppo di partigiani, ognuno con la sua storia e un indistinto, personale ideale da seguire.

If on a Winter's Night a Traveler,,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Italy', 'Novels', 'Books About Books', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']","If on a Winter's Night a Traveler is a marvel of ingenuity, an experimental text that looks longingly back to the great age of narration—""when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded."" Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists, the Reader and the Other Reader, ultimately end up married, having almost finished If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: ""Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade."" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next.The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches—stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition—with explorations of how and why we choose to read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. If on a Winter's Night is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic.

Con suo sommo sgomento, però, scopre che l'appartamento è completamente vuoto. Niente televisore, lavatrice, frigorifero, mobili, tende, niente di niente. Spariti persino gli utensili in cucina, il mortaio di epoca Meiji ereditato dalla nonna materna, la casseruola Le Creuset acquistata con la paga del suo primo impiego, il coltello italiano ricevuto in occasione del suo ventesimo compleanno. E, soprattutto, sparito il fidanzato indiano, maître nel ristorante accanto al suo, un ragazzo con la pelle profumata di spezie.Lo choc di Ringo è tale che resta impietrita al centro della casa desolatamente vuota, la voce che non le esce più dalla bocca. Decide allora di ritornare al villaggio natio, dove non mette più piede da quando, quindicenne, è scappata di casa in un giorno di primavera.Là, appartata nella quiete dei monti, matura il suo dolore. Una mattina, però, osservando il granaio della casa materna, Ringo ha un'idea singolare per tornare pienamente alla vita: aprire un ristorante per non più di una coppia al giorno, con un menu ad hoc, ritagliato sulla fisionomia e i possibili desideri dei clienti.Con l'aiuto del valente Kuma-san, l'ex factotum della scuola elementare del villaggio, il cui cuore è stato infranto dalla bella Shiñorita, un'argentina scappata in città, Ringo risistema il granaio. Pareti tinteggiate d'arancio, posate di epoca vittoriana e di epoca Taish e, nel giro di qualche mese, il Lumachino, così la ragazza battezza il ristorante, apre i battenti.La prima cliente è la Concubina, la triste amante di un influente politico locale, passato a miglior vita diversi anni prima. Sulla tavola, in un tripudio di colori, odori e bontà senza pari, si alternano piatti gustosissimi che attingono alle cucine più famose: giapponese, italiana, cinese e francese su tutte. L'indomani, la Concubina, agghindata di solito a lutto con una lunga veste nera, passeggia con un cappotto rosso fuoco e un magnifico colbacco di pelliccia, e il suo atteggiamento schivo ha lasciato spazio a una marcata allegria. La medesima cosa accade a tutti i clienti del Lumachino: una ragazza riesce a fare innamorare di sé l'ex compagno di classe che l'aveva sempre ignorata, una coppia gay in fuga d'amore tra i monti trasforma il soggiorno in una luna di miele, un uomo burbero e scorbutico diventa un gentiluomo e così via. In breve, la notizia della magia del Lumachino si diffonde in tutto il circondario, e il successo è così garantito, poiché tutti vogliono sedersi alla tavola del ristorante dell'amore ritrovato.",,Le tavole d'oro,01/30/08,May 27th 2010,[],Paperback,,9788854504196,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347567141l/9667161.jpg,3.51,['Premio Bancarella della Cucina (2011)'],98.0,1.0,,,,84.0,1314.0,191,Neri Pozza,"['251', '429', '425', '158', '51']",,[],,"['Ito Ogawa', 'Gianluca Coci']"
Invisible Residents,The Reality of Underwater UFOs,"Body, Mind & Spirit","This book is a groundbreaking contribution to the study of the UFO enigma, originally published over 30 years ago. In this book, Sanderson, a renowned zoologist with a keen interest in the paranormal, puts forward the curious theory that âeoeOINTS""-Other Intelligences-live under the Earthâe(tm)s oceans. This underwater, parallel, civilization may be twice as old as Homo sapiens, he proposes, and may have âeoedeveloped what we call space flight."" Sanderson postulates that the OINTS are behind many UFO sightings as well as the mysterious disappearances of aircraft and ships in the Bermuda Triangle. What better place to have an impenetrable base than deep within the oceans of the planet? Yet, if UFOs, or at least some of them, are coming from beneath our oceans or lakes, does it necessarily mean that there is another civilization besides our own that is responsible? In fact, could it be that since WWII a number of underwater UFO bases have been constructed by the very human governments of our planet? Whatever their source, Sanderson offers here an exhaustive study of USOs (Unidentified Submarine Objects) observed in nearly every part of the world.

Inside The Fire: A Tale of the Insane,,[],"The story takes place in Marseilles. Marseilles is a poor city in the South of France. It is a gate to Europe coming through the sea from North Africa. It was created more than 2000 years ago by Greek settlers coming from the town of Phocea, now on the Turkish coast.Marseilles is today famous in Europe as a city of corruption and violence.In this city was born an insane poet Antonin Artaud who wrote amazing books in the first part of the XXth century and is studied everywhere nowadays. However Artaud went mad and spent about ten years in an asylum in the last part of his life, all through WWII. Treated through intensive electroshock, he remained toothless after that.Artaud is being referenced in the book by the nickname that his mother gave him as a child “Nanaqui,” which is also the one he uses in his own writing.In this tale, Nanaqui comes back from the dead to visit us, with his companion Ivan (the Narrator). He is as obscene, crude, maniac, and delirious as a living dead could be. He meets a witch, Sarah, who drops by Marseilles on the way to the film festival of Cannes. Nanaqui wants to have an affair with her, but it turns out that she prefers a penguin to him (the penguin turns out to be gay actually).The story could be read as a modern tale taking place in the blazing heat of Marseilles, by the Mediterranean Sea, a shore haunted by hundreds of years of decaying civilizations, and through Nanaqui, our hero by the spirit of both greatness and madness.Warning: This book contains adult content, minimal punctuation, explicit language and is not suited for those below 18 years.+",,,,June 30th 2018,[],ebook,,9780463378656,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529668337l/40384576._SY475_.jpg,0.0,[],97.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,Avid Publishing LLC,[],,[],,['Ivan de Monbrison']

Impending Earth,,[],"Three moons lit our night skies back home. We named them Initius, Magnus, and Fortitus, for the first to rise, the strongest to shed light, and the last to disappear in the morning hours. I miss our moons still, and I long dreadfully for the way things used to be, but I do not miss what my home had become in its last days, the days before we were forced to leave in an effort to save our very lives. My entire existence at home was, at one time, filled with peace, the lives of myself and my three friends, even though the four of us were considered the ‘middle dregs’ of our society. I have much to share about our former home, and more to tell regarding why we are no longer there. It is this pride, this lack of both internal and external consciousness, that demanded we flee for our very lives, and this is the story I will relate to you now. My name is Dyzek, my three companions and I come from the planet Marmara in the Copetus galaxy. At one time, many, many moons ago, all of the peoples of Marmara were free, or so we thought, which resulted in our need to escape the impending oppression. I record these truths for those of the future, my ‘children’. The four of us, my ‘family’, desire for those who will come after us and inhabit this new found world, we call “Earth”, to learn of this murderous pride which occupies the heart and soul of every being in our species.

I: The Creation of a Serial Killer,,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Psychology', 'Biography', 'Mystery', 'History', 'Adult', 'Unfinished']","Prize-winning journalist Jack Olsen, armed with unprecedented access to one of the most infamous serial killers in American history, provides a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a murderer in the killer's own words . . .In February 1990, Oregon State Police arrested John Sosnovke and Laverne Pavlinac for the vicious rape and murder of Taunja Bennet, a troubled 23-year-old barfly who had suffered mild retardation since birth. Pavlinac had come forth and confessed, implicating her boyfriend and producing physical evidence that linked them to the crime. Authorities closed the case.There was just one problem. They had the wrong people.And the real killer wasn't about to let anyone take credit for his kill. Keith Hunter Jesperson was a long haul truck driver and the murderer of eight women, including Taunja Bennet. As the case wound through police precincts and courts--ending in life sentences for both Sosnovke and Pavlinac--Jesperson began a twisted one man campaign to win their release. To the editors of newspapers and on the walls of highway rest stops, Jesperson scribbled out a series of taunting confessions:I killed Tanya Bennett . . . I beat her to death, raped her and loved it. Yes I'm sick, but I enjoy myself too. People took the blame and I'm free . . ..Look over your shoulder. I may be closer than you think.At the end of each confession, Jesperson drew a happy face, earning for himself the grisly sobriquet ""The Happy Face Killer.""Based on access to interviews, diaries, court records, and the criminal himself, I: The Creation of a Serial Killer is Jesperson's chilling story. It chronicles his evolution from angry child to sociopathic murderer, from tormentor of animals to torturer of women. It is also the story of the fate that befell him after two innocent citizens were imprisoned four years for one of his killings.Edgar Award winner Jack Olsen lets the killer to tell his story in his own words, offering unprecedented insight into the twisted thought process of a serial murderer. Olsen takes his readers along on Jesperson's vicious cross-country killing spree, letting him describe how he played his ""death game"" with eight innocent victims and how he finally came to grips with the fate he deserved.I: The Creation of a Serial Killer is one of the most revealing and insightful pieces of crime reporting ever published.",,,,August 20th 2002,"['Keith Hunter Jesperson', 'Taunja Bennett', 'Les Jesperson']",Hardcover,,9780312241988,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312057887l/1051549.jpg,3.91,[],93.0,1.0,,,,92.0,2124.0,352,St. Martin's Press,"['720', '723', '508', '118', '55']",,"['Portland, Oregon (United States)', 'Mount Shasta, California (United States)', 'Chilliwack (Canada)', 'Saleh, Washington (United States)', 'Yakima, Washington (United States)', 'Oregon State Penitentiary (United States)']",,['Jack Olsen']

  What do we stand to lose in a world without ice?
A decade ago, novelist and short story writer Jean McNeil spent a year as writer-in-residence with the British Antarctic Survey, and four months on the world’s most enigmatic continent — Antarctica. Access to the Antarctic remains largely reserved for scientists, and it is the only piece of earth that is nobody’s country. Ice Diaries is the story of McNeil’s years spent in ice, not only in the Antarctic but her subsequent travels to Greenland, Iceland, and Svalbard, culminating in a strange event in Cape Town, South Africa, where she journeyed to make what was to be her final trip to the southernmost continent.In the spirit of the diaries of Antarctic explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton, McNeil mixes travelogue, popular science, and memoir to examine the history of our fascination with ice. In entering this world, McNeil unexpectedly finds herself confronting her own upbringing in the Maritimes, the lifelong effects of growing up in a cold place, and how the climates of childhood frame our emotional thermodynamics for life. Ice Diaries is a haunting story of the relationship between beauty and terror, loss and abandonment, transformation and triumph.",,,,March 15th 2016,[],Hardcover,,9781770413184,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440457646l/26113696.jpg,3.4,['Banff Mountain Book Award for Grand Prize (2016)'],91.0,1.0,,,,80.0,186.0,384,ECW Press,"['32', '62', '54', '25', '13']",,[],,['Jean McNeil']

In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash represents one of the peaks of his achievement, a compound of irony, affection, and perfect detail that speaks across generations.In God We Trust, Shepherd's wildly witty reunion with his Indiana hometown, disproves the adage ""You can never go back."" Bending the ear of Flick, his childhood-buddy-turned-bartender, Shepherd recalls passionately his genuine Red Ryder BB gun, confesses adolescent failure in the arms of Junie Jo Prewitt, and relives a story of man against fish that not even Hemingway could rival. From pop art to the World's Fair, Shepherd's subjects speak with a universal irony and are deeply and unabashedly grounded in American Midwestern life, together rendering a wonderfully nostalgic impression of a more innocent era when life was good, fun was clean, and station wagons roamed the earth.A comic genius who bridged the gap between James Thurber and David Sedaris, Shepherd may have accomplished for Holden, Indiana, what Mark Twain did for Hannibal, Missouri.",,,11/06/66,April 28th 1991,[],Paperback,,9780385021746,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403178045l/30152.jpg,3.91,[],49.0,1.0,,,,93.0,3353.0,272,Broadway Books,"['1049', '1233', '833', '192', '46']",,[],,['Jean Shepherd']

La signora Marguerite van Gogh. La moglie di Vincent. Sono vecchia e stanca, sto per andarmene, ma non rimpiangerò questa terra. Ritroverò Vincent e staremo insieme per sempre». Nella torrida estate del 1890, a Auvers-sur-Oise, un uomo si presenta a casa del dottor Gachet: dall’aspetto, Marguerite, figlia del medico, lo scambia per uno dei tanti braccianti agricoli che lavorano nella zona. L’uomo è Vincent van Gogh, e per Marguerite, che ama dipingere ma si dibatte tra l’insoddisfazione di non riuscire a creare nulla di apprezzabile e una condizione di figlia predestinata a un matrimonio borghese, egli assume, giorno dopo giorno, le fattezze del maestro, del genio, dell’amore. Guardandolo dipingere, la giovane vede ora i paesaggi in cui è cresciuta – le case dai tetti di paglia, le acque del fiume, i fiori, gli alberi, il cielo – con nuovi occhi: la potenza della vera arte si dispiega davanti a lei, mentre la relazione con Vincent si fa sempre più stretta, più pericolosa e infine fatale. Mettendo insieme, come nel Club degli incorreggibili ottimisti, potenza del racconto e verità documentaria, e consegnandoci pagine di vera poesia quando assistiamo insieme a Marguerite alla nascita dei capolavori di van Gogh, Guenassia fa rivivere l’epoca d’oro degli impressionisti e getta una nuova luce sulla tragica fine dell’artista e sui misteri che circondano alcune delle sue opere; e lo fa come sempre da un’angolatura originale, tratteggiando ancora una volta un’indimenticabile figura femminile.",,Romanzo,08/17/16,April 18th 2017,[],Paperback,,9788893810937,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489151854l/34525316.jpg,3.52,[],97.0,1.0,,,,88.0,667.0,280,Salani,"['105', '228', '254', '67', '13']",,[],,"['Jean-Michel Guenassia', 'Francesco Bruno']"

In Other Words,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Biography', 'Writing', 'Italian Literature', 'Essays', 'Audiobook', 'Travel']","From the Pulitzer Prize winner, a surprising, powerful, and eloquent nonfiction debutIn Other Words is at heart a love story—of a long and sometimes difficult courtship, and a passion that verges on obsession: that of a writer for another language. For Jhumpa Lahiri, that love was for Italian, which first captivated and capsized her during a trip to Florence after college. And although Lahiri studied Italian for many years afterward, true mastery had always eluded her. So in 2012, seeking full immersion, she decided to move to Rome with her family, for “a trial by fire, a sort of baptism” into a new language and world. In Rome, Lahiri began to read, and to write—initially in her journal—solely in Italian. In Other Words, an autobiographical work written in Italian, investigates the process of learning to express oneself in another language, and describes the journey of a writer seeking a new voice. Presented in a dual-language format, it is a book about exile, linguistic and otherwise, written with an intensity and clarity not seen since Nabokov.

In Irreligion he presents the case for his own worldview, organizing his book into twelve chapters that refute the twelve arguments most often put forward for believing in God's existence. The latter arguments, Paulos relates in his characteristically lighthearted style, ""range from what might be called golden oldies to those with a more contemporary beat. On the playlist are the firstcause argument, the argument from design, the ontological argument, arguments from faith and biblical codes, the argument from the anthropic principle, the moral universality argument, and others."" Interspersed among his twelve counterarguments are remarks on a variety of irreligious themes, ranging from the nature of miracles and creationist probability to cognitive illusions and prudential wagers. Special attention is paid to topics, arguments, and questions that spring from his incredulity ""not only about religion but also about others' credulity.""

In Defence of Dogs,,"['Nonfiction', 'Dogs', 'Animals', 'Science', 'Biology', 'Nature', 'Popular Science', 'History']","John Bradshaw, one of the world's leading dog experts, brings us a compelling insight into what dogs would ask us for, if only they knew how. The dog has been mankind's faithful companion for tens of thousands of years, yet today finds itself in crisis throughout the western world. Until just over a hundred years ago, most dogs worked for their living, and each of the many breeds had become well suited, over countless generations, to the task for which they were bred. Now, in their purely domestic roles we fail to understand their needs. And it is time that someone stood up for dogdom: not the caricature of the wolf in a dog suit, ready to dominate its unsuspecting owner at the first sign of weakness, not the trophy animal that collects rosettes and kudos for its breeder, but the real dog, the pet that just wants to be one of the family and enjoy life. Biologists now know far more about what really makes dogs tick than they did twenty years ago, but this new understanding has been slow to percolate through to owners, and has not yet made enough of a difference to the lives of the dogs themselves. This book is here to set the record straight.",,,10/30/11,July 1st 2011,[],Hardcover,,9781846142956,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346639530l/12002008.jpg,4.0,[],98.0,1.0,,,,95.0,721.0,256,Allen Lane,"['239', '286', '163', '26', '7']",,[],,['John Bradshaw']

In Your Dreams,,[],"On an ancient planet within our galaxy, a dark and fearsome terror has awoken from its long slumber. Its task is to work quietly from the unseen, spreading dissent through the vulnerable territories of the free races; weakening them for its master. By a chance meeting, it comes across a young girl in the swampy and mist choked lands of Endmoor. Her name is Mim, and the pairing of her platinum hair and violet eyes has not been seen since the Great War 1,000 years earlier; and has attracted unwanted attention. Knowing it hunts her, Mim flees and starts on a journey that takes her far across the Great Isle of Aldaya; the only landmass that now sits above the waves. Unbeknownst to her, she is the key to unraveling the darkness that is falling over the Great Isle; an emptiness that threatens to swallow not only Aldaya, but the Sphere as well, and all its futures to come.",Aldaya #1,1,09/11/14,September 14th 2014 ,[],ebook,,9780990655503,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404526902l/22664583.jpg,4.44,[],100.0,1.0,,,,94.0,16.0,276,,"['10', '4', '1', '1', '0']",,[],,['John Swan']
I Want You to Be My Second,,[],"I Want You to Be My Second is a short story collection about young people dating, hooking up, getting things wrong and trying to make them right. In his first book, John-Mark Davidson creates a less than perfect world of romance. The stories follow a handful of flawed characters from the confusing kisses of adolescence, through the blurry parties of college, to the this-isn't-where-I-thought-I-would-be mornings of adulthood. A newly-single man masters the science of picking up women in STD clinics. A college freshman's mistake prompts him to sneak off to North Dakota. And a traveling businessman neglects a multi-million-dollar crisis by stopping at a bar. Arrows whizz above a city. Lies are told. Truths are confessed. Consequences swell slowly. Lovers split, but never really leave. A dead man ascends. A young woman stumbles. And someone is hiding under the bed. I Want You to Be My Second is rich in emotion, snappy with dialogue and offers up as many jokes as it does heavy moments. This book is for everyone who didn't get it right the first time.

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.

If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things,,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Poetry', 'Mystery', 'Adult', 'Literature', 'Unfinished']","Risky in conception, hip and yet soulful, this is a prose poem of a novel -- intense, lyrical, and highly evocative -- with a mystery at its center, which keeps the reader in suspense until the final page. In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day's end when a terrible accident occurs. This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book. But it is the author's exquisite rendering of the ordinary, the everyday, that gives this novel its freshness, its sense of beauty, wonder, and hope.

That brainstorming meetings are a terrible idea? That the color blue can help you double your creative output?From the New York Times best-selling author of How We Decide comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative “types,” Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. It’s a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively.Lehrer reveals the importance of embracing the rut, thinking like a child, daydreaming productively, and adopting an outsider’s perspective (travel helps). He unveils the optimal mix of old and new partners in any creative collaboration, and explains why criticism is essential to the process. Then he zooms out to show how we can make our neighborhoods more vibrant, our companies more productive, and our schools more effective.You’ll learn about Bob Dylan’s writing habits and the drug addictions of poets. You’ll meet a Manhattan bartender who thinks like a chemist, and an autistic surfer who invented an entirely new surfing move. You’ll see why Elizabethan England experienced a creative explosion, and how Pixar’s office space is designed to spark the next big leap in animation.Collapsing the layers separating the neuron from the finished symphony, Imagine reveals the deep inventiveness of the human mind, and its essential role in our increasingly complex world. http://www.jonahlehrer.com/ ",,,,March 19th 2012,"['Dan Wieden', 'Anne Adams', 'Spencer Silver', 'Paul Romer', 'Andy Cobb', 'Bobby Podesta']",Hardcover,,9780547386072,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327000473l/12987640.jpg,3.82,[],268.0,3.0,,,,87.0,37700.0,279,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['12916', '12079', '7947', '2503', '2255']",,[],,['Jonah Lehrer']

I Kissed Dating Goodbye: A New Attitude Toward Relationships and Romance,,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Relationships', 'Christianity', 'Christian Living', 'Religion', 'Marriage', 'Self Help', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Spirituality']","While most Christians agree to seek purity and save sex for marriage, few have been given a blueprint for how that should affect their view of dating and love. In I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Joshua Harris exposes the ""Seven Habits of Highly Defective Dating"" and offers a realistic outline of how to have a biblical vision of marriage. Harris contends that one must begin with a new attitude, viewing love, purity, and singleness from God's perspective rather than thinking that love and romance are to be enjoyed ""solely for recreation."" In such well-named chapters as ""Guarding Your Heart"" and ""What Matters at Fifty,"" Harris encourages the reader to look at one's character rather than reveling in infatuation, to regard love as a truly selfless, biblical act rather than a feeling. He refutes the concept that we are victims of ""falling in love"" (that it is beyond our control), saying that ""God wants us to seek guidance from scriptural truth, not feeling. Smart love looks beyond personal desires and the gratification of the moment. It looks at the big picture: serving others and glorifying God.""

Her poems, both sacred and secular, are written with the passions of anger, grief, and love, at once tender and furious. They are rooted in the land; they are one with the deer and the fox, the hawk and the eagle, the sun, moon, and wind, and the seasons – “spring/ was lean and hungry with the hope of children and corn.” There are enemies here, also lovers; there are ghost dancers, ancestors old and new, who rise again “to walk in shoes of fire.”Indeed, fire and its aftermath is a constant image in the burning book. Skies are “incendiary”; the “smoke of dawn” turns enemies into ashes: “I am fire eaten by wind.” “Your fire scorched/ my lips.” “I am lighting the fire that crawls from my spine/ to the gods with a coal from my sister’s flame.”But the spirit of this book is not consumed. It is not limited by mad love or war, and “there is something larger than the memory/ of a dispossessed people.” That something larger is, for example, revolution, freedom, birth.",,,01/01/90,July 15th 2019,[],Paperback,,9780819511829,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1450753216l/780823._SX318_.jpg,4.23,['American Book Award (1991)'],57.0,1.0,,,,96.0,601.0,67,Wesleyan University Press,"['284', '205', '85', '21', '6']",,[],,['Joy Harjo']

Once in Poitou, Siri hopes to find employment in an illuminator's shop - until Triston unexpectedly snatches her heart away with a kiss.Triston is a man of quiet honor and courage, but the guild he carries for the death of his late wife, Clothilde, has left him numb and hesitant to love again.

Fans of Viorst’s funny, touching, and wise decades poems will love these verses filled with witty advice and reflections on marriage, milestones, and middle-aged children. Viorst explores, among the many other issues of this stage of life, the state of our sex lives and teeth, how we can stay married though thermostatically incompatible, and the joys of grandparenthood and shopping. Readers will nod with rueful recognition when she asks, “Am I required to think of myself as a basically shallow woman because I feel better when my hair looks good?,” when she presses a few helpful suggestions on her kids because “they may be middle aged, but they’re still my children,” and when she graciously—but not too graciously—selects her husband’s next mate in a poem deliciously subtitled “If I Should Die Before I Wake, Here’s the Wife You Next Should Take.” Though Viorst acknowledges she is definitely not a good sport about the fact that she is mortal, her poems are full of the pleasures of life right now, helping us come to terms with the passage of time, encouraging us to keep trying to fix the world, and inviting us to consider “drinking wine, making love, laughing hard, caring hard, and learning a new trick or two as part of our job description at seventy.” I'm Too Young to Be Seventy is a joy to read and makes a heartwarming gift for anyone who has reached or is soon to reach that—it’s not so bad after all—seventh decade.",,,,2005.0,,,0743267745,9780743267748,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SuPUwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.94,,,,,,,,,64.0,,,188.0,,,['Judith Viorst']

In the Time of the Butterflies,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'School', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Latin American', 'Adult']","Set during the waning days of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic in 1960, this extraordinary novel tells the story of the Mirabal sisters, three young wives and mothers who are assassinated after visiting their jailed husbands. From the author of How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents comes this tale of courage and sisterhood set in the Dominican Republic during the rise of the Trujillo dictatorship. A skillful blend of fact and fiction, In the Time of the Butterflies is inspired by the true story of the three Mirabal sisters who, in 1960, were murdered for their part in an underground plot to overthrow the government. Alvarez breathes life into these historical figures--known as ""las mariposas,"" or ""the butterflies,"" in the underground--as she imagines their teenage years, their gradual involvement with the revolution, and their terror as their dissentience is uncovered.  Alvarez's controlled writing perfectly captures the mounting tension as ""the butterflies"" near their horrific end. The novel begins with the recollections of Dede, the fourth and surviving sister, who fears abandoning her routines and her husband to join the movement. Alvarez also offers the perspectives of the other sisters: brave and outspoken Minerva, the family's political ringleader; pious Patria, who forsakes her faith to join her sisters after witnessing the atrocities of the tyranny; and the baby sister, sensitive Maria Teresa, who, in a series of diaries, chronicles her allegiance to Minerva and the physical and spiritual anguish of prison life.

Louisa resents that the charismatic Clem has always been the favorite; yet as Clem puts it, “On the other side of the fence–mine–every expectation you fulfill . . . puts you one stop closer to that Grand Canyon rim from which you could one day rule the world–or plummet in very grand style.” In this vivid, heartrending story of what we can and cannot do for those we love, the sisters grow closer as they move farther apart. Louis settles in New York while Clem, a wildlife biologist, moves restlessly about until she lands in the Rocky Mountains. Their complex bond, Louisa observes, is “like a double helix, two souls coiling around a common axis, joined yet never touching.”Alive with all the sensual detail and riveting characterization that mark Glass’s previous work, I See You Everywhere is a piercingly candid story of life and death, companionship and sorrow, and the nature of sisterhood itself.",,,,October 14th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780375422751,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320472631l/3078805.jpg,3.22,[],88.0,2.0,,,,79.0,5670.0,287,Pantheon,"['536', '1686', '2231', '924', '293']",,[],,['Julia Glass']
Inconceivable,A Woman's Triumph Over Despair and Statistics,Health & Fitness,"A memoir of hope for the thousands of women struggling with infertility, from one who beat the odds by simply tuning in to her body and tapping her well of sheer determination. At a time when more and more women are trying to get pregnant at increasingly advanced ages, fertility specialists and homeopathic researchers boast endless treatment options. But when Julia Indichova made the rounds of medical doctors and nontraditional healers, she was still unable to conceive a child. It was only when she forsook their financially and emotionally draining advice, turning inward instead, that she finally met with reproductive success.Inconceivablerecounts this journey from hopeless diagnoses to elated motherhood. Anyone who has faced infertility will relate to Julia’s desperate measures: acupuncture, unidentifiable black-and-white pellets, herb soup, foul-smelling fruit, even making love on red sheets. Five reproductive endocrinologists told her that there was no documented case of anyone in her hormonal condition getting pregnant, forcing her to finally embark on her own intuitive regimen. After eight caffeine-free, nutrient-rich, yoga-laden months, complemented by visualization exercises, Julia received amazing news; incredibly, she was pregnant. Nine months later she gave birth to a healthy girl. Unlike the many infertility books that take a clinical “how to” approach,Inconceivablesimply professes the wisdom of giving expert status back to the patient. Julia’s self-discovery, and her ability to see her body as an ally once again, yield a beautiful message about the importance of honoring the body’s innate powers, and the power of life itself.",,,,2001.0,,,0767908201,9780767908207,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cpWFPQ2g-cIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.82,,,,,,,,,224.0,,,163.0,,,['Julia Indichova']

India Junction: A Window to the Nation,,[],"The Indian Railways provides us with a practical, convenient mode of transport, but its contribution to Indian life goes much beyond that. The Railways is the lifeline of the nation and, in many ways, its development has been deeply intertwined with the destiny of India. India Junction, featuring in-depth, analytical essays that are rich in history, delectable travel pieces and some truly amazing and rare photo features, celebrates the changes the Railways has brought about in our lives and examines how the Railways itself has transformed over time. 'The Great Indian Railways' takes us to 1853, the year train travel began in India and analyses how it strengthened British rule. 'Railway Filmy Chakkar' recounts how Mahatma Gandhi, who was first opposed to the Railways, went on to effectively use it in the freedom struggle. The travelogues, too, are delightfully evocative and bring to vivid life the sights and sounds of train travel in India, some contemporary, others long consigned to memory. 'When the Train Came to Deyra Dhoon' remembers the furore caused by an engine chugging into a sleepy little town for the first time. 'On Board the Bombay Express' recreates the tangy, savoury smells that are released into the carriage and the keen appetites that they awaken when women crack open the tiffin boxes which they have brought from home.

Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Politics', 'Indian Literature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Womens', 'Asia']","On the morning of October 31, 1984, as she walked through her garden, smiling, with hands raised and palms pressed together in the traditional Indian namaste greeting, Indira Nehru Gandhi was assassinated by her own bodyguards. She died as she had lived, surrounded by men, yet isolated. It was a violent end to a life of epic drama. Here is the first popular biography of one of the world's most influential leaders, India's third prime minister. Brought up during an era that saw the rise of Indian nationalism, Indira was raised to be what her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, called ""a child of revolution"" - destined to play a political role in the creation and governing of an independent India. Despite her early reluctance to embrace this role, Indira eventually presided over a huge, complex, religiously riven, and male-dominated country. She was born to a wealthy, westernized family, but she had a gift for connecting with the poor of the countryside and the urban slums, the illiterate, the dispossessed - so much so that ""Indira is India"" became a familiar slogan. Throughout childhood, love, marriage, imprisonment, motherhood, and a sequence of personal and family tragedies, her personal hopes and desires were continually subsumed by the historical and political imperatives of her country. In this beautifully written book, the acclaimed biographer Katherine Frank draws on unpublished sources and more than a hundred interviews to create a rich, balanced portrait. INDIRA captures in full color the personal and political fate of the leader of the world's largest democracy - the woman who played a dominant role in the history of the twentieth century and who, when it ended, was voted Woman of the Millennium by the BBC.",,,10/30/01,2002,[],Hardcover,,9780395730973,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387701553l/290376.jpg,4.0,['Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2001)'],122.0,2.0,,,,94.0,1974.0,592,Houghton Mifflin,"['677', '784', '388', '80', '45']",,[],,['Katherine Frank']

These persons also blocked her appointment as police commissioner. This kind of sabotage was the proverbial last straw that compelled her to 'shake off the shackles'. After a long and rewarding innings (35 years in all), Kiran Bedi decided to move on. She believed that she could no longer work with persons who were keeping the system enslaved. She was clear in her mind that she was not going to be subordinated by this team of saboteurs. What direction and leadership would such persons provide except to create pygmies and stifle initiative and crush morale? She did not want to be a part of such dubious 'history'. As she asserts: 'My self-respect, my innate sense of justice and my beliefs and values in life propelled me to throw off the ""yokes"" that were already obstructing my growth and I now made up my mind to set myself free and be a master of my own time.' This is a no-holds-barred narrative packed with punch, spirit and vitality. Chosen as 'India's most admired woman', Kiran Bedi is a highly recognized and decorated police officer, who has won several accolades, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service. Throughout her career, Kiran Bedi (who joined the Indian Police Service in 1972) dared to remain innovative to meet the challenges posed by her different assignments: be it policing, managing prisons or imparting training.

A lanky kid from Plano, Texas, is raised by a feisty, single parent who sacrifices for her son, who becomes one of our country's greatest athletes. Given that background, it is understandable why Armstrong was able to channel his boundless energy toward athletic endeavors. By his senior year in high school, he was already a professional triathlete and was training with the U.S. Olympic cycling developmental team. In 1993, Armstrong secured a position in the ranks of world-class cyclists by winning the World Championship and a Tour de France stage, but in 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Armstrong entered an unknown battlefield and challenged it as if climbing through the Alps: aggressive yet tactical. He beat the cancer and proceeded to stun all the pundits by winning the 1999 Tour de France. In this memoir, Armstrong covers his early years swiftly with a blunt matter-of-factness, but the main focus is on his battle with cancer. Readers will respond to the inspirational recovery story, and they will appreciate the behind-the-scenes cycling information. After he won the Tour, his mother was quoted as saying that her son's whole life has been a fight against the odds; we see here that she was not exaggerating.

Laura Benedict writes with tender power and understanding, filling the pages with characters whose mysteries and longings will matter to every reader.”–Luanne Rice, author of The Edge of Winter Sometimes the past comes looking for you. . . .Two years ago, in idyllic Carystown, Kentucky, nine-year-old Isabella Moon disappeared on her way home from school. Is it just coincidence that Kate Russell, a young woman with no discernible past, arrived in town just months before Isabella’s disappearance? When Kate walks into Sheriff Bill Delaney’s office to tell him that Isabella’s ghost has led her to the child’s hidden grave, he immediately views her as a suspect. Mystery follows mystery as a local athlete drops dead, inexplicably, on the basketball court, and someone close to Kate is viciously murdered.Quiet Carystown was to be Kate’s salvation, and she’s settled into a comfortable job, a charming cottage, and a blissful romance. But having lied to her boyfriend, Caleb, for so long about the terrors of her past life, she finds she can’t trust him to understand the terror that Isabella Moon has now brought. And Kate’s best friend, Francie, is too wrapped up in her own troubles–particularly a secret affair with a man she at once loves and despises–to give Kate the help she needs. Utterly alone, Kate is torn between finding justice for the dead child and keeping away old ghosts of her own.The unsolved disappearance of Isabella Moon has been the biggest disappointment of Sheriff Delaney’s career. But he senses that Kate is trouble. As he investigates her impossible claims, he also uncovers a series of unsettling truths about Carystown itself. Behind his hometown’s genteel façade is a morass of lies and murder, drugs and destruction. And Carystown’s residents are about to discover that even though the past is buried, it can rise again–with a vengeance.Dark and suspenseful, tense and eerie, tinged with the supernatural, Isabella Moon is an engrossing, beautifully written debut novel, a breathtaking and artful story of the dark mysteries that can lurk in the most bucolic of places–and the ghost of a little girl who watches as evil rises unstoppably to the surface.",,,,September 25th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780345497673,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408313592l/1097633.jpg,3.14,[],100.0,1.0,,,,73.0,526.0,368,Ballantine Books,"['63', '136', '183', '101', '43']",,"['Carystown, Kentucky (United States)', 'Kentucky (United States)']",,['Laura Benedict']

Kids should also enjoy studying the subtleties in Bond's colorful illustrations, such as the facial expressions of the book's adorable protagonist or the details found in a mountain of bubbles and the contents of a closet. Easy to understand, stimulating to both mind and eye, and irresistibly amusing, this is one book children will likely want to read over and over again.

Thankfully, the bestselling duo of author Laura Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond -- creators of 
  If You Take a Mouse to the Movies
 and 
  If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
 -- have teamed up to show us the hijinks a whiskered school guest could cause.Starting with asking for your lunchbox, this critter is set for mischief. The feisty mouse asks for a snack for later (cookies of course), a notebook, and pencils, and wants ""to share your backpack, too."" After he arrives at school, the pushy classmate tries his hand (make that paw) at math and writing on the blackboard, afterward whipping up a messy, pink science experiment and building a ""little mouse house"" from blocks. The schooltime antics don't stop there, but a busy mouse tends to get hungry after so much playtime. Naturally his snack is in the lunchbox, which is stored ""in a safe place"" with his new picture book inside.Following the whimsical style of their previous books, Numeroff and Bond have done it again. Their high-adrenaline mouse will have readers cheering while their eyes comb the illustrations for extra nibbles of fun.

Psychologist and introvert Laurie Helgoe reveals that more than half of all Americans are. Introverts gain energy and power through reflection and solitude. Our culture, however, is geared toward the extrovert. The pressure to enjoy parties, chatter, and interactions can lead people to think that an inward orientation is a problem instead of an opportunity. Helgoe shows that the exact opposite is true: Introverts can capitalize on this inner source of power. INTROVERT POWER is a groundbreaking call for an introvert renaissance, a blueprint for how introverts can take full advantage of this hidden strength in daily life. Supplemented by the voices of several introverts, Helgoe presents a startling look at introvert numbers, influence, and economic might. Revolutionary and invaluable, INTROVERT POWER includes ideas for how introverts can learn to: Claim private spaceCarve out time to thinkBring a slower tempo into daily lifeCreate breaks in conversation and relationshipsDeal effectively with parties, interruptions, and crowds QUIET IS MIGHT.

Il ladro di nebbia,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction']","Antonio M. Fonte è uno scrittore di enorme successo, ma per lui fama e ricchezza non hanno alcun significato. Stralunato e sociopatico, vive in una vecchia casa dei Quartieri Spagnoli di Napoli con la gatta Calliope, e se non ci fosse il suo agente letterario a ricordargli scadenze e doveri sarebbe incapace di distinguere ciò che è reale da ciò che forse non lo è. Ma un giorno, in mezzo alle migliaia di lettere dei suoi ammiratori, Antonio ne riceve una che non può ignorare. Datata quindici anni prima, è indirizzata a una donna che Antonio non crede di avere mai conosciuto. Solo il nome del mittente gli è familiare, perché è il suo. Quella lettera l’ha scritta lui, senza alcun dubbio. Quelle parole accennano a un ricordo smarrito e soprattutto a un uomo che è stato ucciso, forse da lui stesso. Ma Antonio di tutto questo non ricorda nulla.Il giorno del suo cinquantesimo compleanno, si perde nei vicoli di Napoli e in un palazzo mai visto prima incontra uno strano personaggio che ha la mania di raccogliere tutto ciò che gli uomini perdono: nel suo Ufficio Oggetti Smarriti, però, non si trovano solo mazzi di chiavi, libri o calzini spaiati, ma anche ricordi di giochi infantili, amori giovanili, speranze e sogni dimenticati. Antonio intuisce che forse è da lì che deve partire per ritrovare il filo del suo passato e risolvere l’enigma della lettera. Ma quell’enigma nasconde arcani ancora più insondabili: il segreto di una città che cambia forma e aspetto, l’avventura di un viaggio imprevedibile tra personaggi straordinari, il mistero di un ladro fatto di nebbia e di una storia tutta da ricostruire... e da raccontare.",,,,May 21st 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,B00WX990QQ,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432205481l/25574766._SX318_.jpg,3.59,[],79.0,1.0,,,,82.0,231.0,412,Longanesi,"['57', '72', '60', '34', '8']",,[],,['Lavinia Petti']

Immigrant Acts,On Asian American Cultural Politics,Social Science,"In Immigrant Acts, Lisa Lowe argues that understanding Asian immigration to the United States is fundamental to understanding the racialized economic and political foundations of the nation. Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture. Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the “foreigner-within.” In Immigrant Acts, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant—at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation—displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a “failed” integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders. In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans. Extending the range of Asian American critique, Immigrant Acts will interest readers concerned with race and ethnicity in the United States, American cultures, immigration, and transnationalism.",,,,1996.0,,,0822318644,9780822318644,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CZXtZ8lFepsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.0,,,,,,,,,272.0,,,197.0,,,['Lisa Lowe']

Or so I told myself. Later, I’d question that, as I would question pretty much everything I knew about me, my relationships, and my desires. It all began when my neighbor thrust a key to a storage unit at me. She’d bought it to make extra money after watching some storage auction show. Now she was on her way to the airport to elope with a man she barely knew, and she needed me to clear out the unit before the lease expired.Soon, I was standing inside a small room that held the intimate details of another woman’s life, feeling uncomfortable, as if I was invading her privacy. Why had she let these items so neatly packed, possessions that she clearly cared about deeply, be lost at an auction? Driven to find out by some unnamed force, I began to dig, to discover this woman’s life, and yes, read her journals—-dark, erotic journals that I had no business reading. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I read on obsessively, living out fantasies through her words that I’d never dare experience on my own, compelled by the three men in her life, none of whom had names. I read onward until the last terrifying dark entry left me certain that something had happened to this woman. I had to find her and be sure she was okay.Before long, I was taking her job for the summer at the art gallery, living her life, and she was nowhere to be found. I was becoming someone I didn’t know. I was becoming her.The dark, passion it becomes…Now, I am working at a prestigious gallery, where I have always dreamed of being, and I’ve been delivered to the doorstep of several men, all of which I envision as one I’ve read about in the journal. But there is one man that will call to me, that will awaken me in ways I never believed possible. That man is the ruggedly sexy artist, Chris Merit, who wants to paint me. He is rich and famous, and dark in ways I shouldn’t find intriguing, but I do. I so do. I don’t understand why his dark side appeals to me, but the attraction between us is rich with velvety promises of satisfaction. Chris is dark, and so are his desires, but I cannot turn away. He is damaged beneath his confident good looks and need for control, and in some way, I feel he needs me. I need him.All I know for certain is that he knows me like I don’t even know me, and he says I know him. Still, I keep asking myself — do I know him? Did he know her, the journal writer, and where is she? And why doesn’t it seem to matter anymore?

It Does Not Die,,"['Romance', 'India', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Romantic', 'Asia', 'Autobiography']","Precocious, a poet, a philosopher's daughter, Maitreyi Devi was sixteen years old in 1930 when Mircea Eliade came to Calcutta to study with her father. More than forty years passed before Devi read Bengal Nights, the novel Eliade had fashioned out of their encounter, only to find small details and phrases, even her given name, bringing back episodes and feelings she had spent decades trying to forget. It Does Not Die is Devi's response. In part a counter to Eliade's fantasies, the book is also a moving account of a first love fraught with cultural tensions, of false starts and lasting regrets.Proud of her intelligence, Maitreyi Devi's father had provided her with a fine and, for that time, remarkably liberal education — and encouraged his brilliant foreign student, Eliade, to study with her. ""We were two good exhibits in his museum,"" Devi writes. They were also, as it turned out, deeply taken with each other. When their secret romance was discovered, Devi's father banished the young Eliade from their home. Against a rich backdrop of life in an upper-caste Hindu household, Devi powerfully recreates the confusion of an over-educated child simultaneously confronting sex and the differences, not only between European and Indian cultures, but also between her mother's and father's view of what was right. Amid a tangle of misunderstandings, between a European man and an Indian girl, between student and teacher, husband and wife, father and daughter, she describes a romance unfolding in the face of cultural differences but finally succumbing to cultural constraints. On its own, It Does Not Die is a fascinating story of cultural conflict and thwarted love. Read together with Eliade's Bengal Nights, Devi's ""romance"" is a powerful study of what happens when the oppositions between innocence and experience, enchantment and disillusion, and cultural difference and colonial arrogance collide. ""In two novels written forty years apart, a man and a woman tell stories of their love. . . . Taken together they provide an unusually touching story of young love unable to prevail against an opposition whose strength was tragically buttressed by the uncertainties of a cultural divide.""—Isabel Colegate, New York Times Book Review""Recreates, with extraordinary vividness, the 16-year-old in love that she had been. . . .

Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?This is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment.Arthur is the only man who can share Lauren's secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence.

In Other Worlds also reprints some of Atwood's key reviews of other practitioners of the form and thoughts about SF.

More than twenty years after her stunning big screen debut, the Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominated actress is an inspirational force of nature -- a mother, an activist, and a role model for millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing people around the world.In I'll Scream Later, Marlee takes readers on the frank and touching journey of her life, from the frightening loss of her hearing at eighteen months old to the highs and lows of Hollywood, her battles with addiction, and the unexpected challenges of being thrust into the spotlight as an emissary for the deaf community. She speaks candidly for the first time about the troubles of her youth, the passionate and tumultuous two-year relationship with Oscar winner William Hurt that dovetailed with a stint in rehab, and her subsequent romances with heartthrobs like Rob Lowe, Richard Dean Anderson, and David E. Kelley.Though she became famous at the age of twenty-one, Marlee struggled all her life to connect with people, fighting against anyone who tried to hold her back. Her own mother often hid behind their communication barrier, and Marlee turned to drugs before she even started high school. However, she found in acting -- with the encouragement of her mentor, Henry Winkler -- a discipline, a drive, and a talent for understanding the human condition that belied her age and her inability to hear. By the time Hollywood embraced her, she had almost no formal training, a fact that caused many other deaf actors to give her the cold shoulder, even as she was looked upon as a spokesperson for their community.She has played memorable roles on wildly popular television shows such as Seinfeld, The West Wing, and The L Word, danced a show-stopping cha-cha-cha on Dancing with the Stars, and now, with uncompromising honesty and humor, Marlee shares the story of her life -- an enduring tale that is an unforgettable lesson in following your dreams.",,,03/31/09,April 14th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9781439102855,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347796502l/5957923.jpg,3.58,[],174.0,2.0,,,,86.0,1356.0,326,Simon Spotlight Entertainment,"['300', '420', '446', '153', '37']",,[],,"['Marlee Matlin', 'Betsy Sharkey']"

Many prominent writers have acknowledged its influence on their work; students of intellectual history consider it a landmark; and the generation born after World War II considers Buber one of its prophets. Buber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways: (1) that of the ""I"" toward an ""It,"" toward an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience; (2) that of the ""I"" toward ""Thou,"" in which we move into existence in a relationship without bounds. One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. All of our relationships, Buber contends, bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.The need for a new English translation had been felt for many years. The old version was marred by many inaccuracies and misunderstandings, and its recurrent use of the archaic ""thou"" was seriously misleading. Professor Walter Kaufmann, a distinguished writer and philosopher in his own right who was close to Buber, retranslated the work at the request of Buber's family. He added a wealth of informative footnotes to clarify obscurities and bring the reader closer to the original and wrote an extensive prologue that opened up new perspectives on the book and on Buber's thought. This volume provided a new basis for all subsequent discussions of Buber.",,,10/30/23,February 1st 1971,[],Paperback,,9780684717258,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401410405l/551866.jpg,4.05,[],164.0,2.0,,,,91.0,9768.0,185,Charles Scribner's Sons (NY),"['4248', '2922', '1745', '580', '273']",,[],,"['Martin Buber', 'Walter Kaufmann']"
Israel: A History,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'Judaism', 'Religion', 'World History', 'Politics', '20th Century', '19th Century']","Israel is a small and relatively young country, but its turbulent history has placed it squarely at the centre of the world stage for most of this century. For two millennia the Jews, dispersed all over the world, prayed for a return to Zion. Until the nineteenth century, that dream seemed a fantasy, but then a secular Zionist movement was born and soon the initial trickle of Jewish immigrants to Palestine turned into a flood as Jews fled persecution in Europe. From these beginnings, Martin Gilbert traces the events and personalities that would lead to the sudden, dramatic declaration of Statehood in May 1948.From that point on, Israel's history has been dominated by conflict: Suez, the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon and the Intifada.

I Am Hutterite takes readers into the hidden heart of the little-known Hutterite colony in southern Manitoba where author Mary-Ann Kirkby spent her childhood. When she was ten years old her parents packed up their seven children and a handful of possessions and left the security of the colony to start a new life. Overnight they were thrust into a world they didn't understand, a world that did not understand them.Before she left the colony Mary-Ann had never tasted macaroni and cheese or ridden a bike. She had never heard of Walt Disney or rock-and-roll. She was forced to reinvent herself, denying her heritage to fit in with her peers. With great humor, Kirkby describes how she adapted to popular culture; and with raw honesty her family's deep sense of loss for their community.

Insane Clown President: Dispatches from the 2016 Circus,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Journalism', 'Essays', 'Audiobook', 'Presidents', 'American History', 'American', 'Humor']","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - Dispatches from the 2016 election that provide an eerily prescient take on our democracy's uncertain future, by the country's most perceptive and fearless political journalist.In twenty-five pieces from Rolling Stone--plus two original essays--Matt Taibbi tells the story of Western civilization's very own train wreck, from its tragicomic beginnings to its apocalyptic conclusion. Years before the clown car of candidates was fully loaded, Taibbi grasped the essential themes of the story: the power of spectacle over substance, or even truth; the absence of a shared reality; the nihilistic rebellion of the white working class; the death of the political establishment; and the emergence of a new, explicit form of white nationalism that would destroy what was left of the Kingian dream of a successful pluralistic society.Taibbi captures, with dead-on, real-time analysis, the failures of the right and the left, from the thwarted Bernie Sanders insurgency to the flawed and aimless Hillary Clinton campaign; the rise of the ""dangerously bright"" alt-right with its wall-loving identity politics and its rapturous view of the ""Racial Holy War"" to come; and the giant fail of a flailing, reactive political media that fed a ravenous news cycle not with reporting on political ideology, but with undigested propaganda served straight from the campaign bubble. At the center of it all stands Donald J. Trump, leading a historic revolt against his own party, ""bloviating and farting his way"" through the campaign, ""saying outrageous things, acting like Hitler one minute and Andrew Dice Clay the next."" For Taibbi, the stunning rise of Trump marks the apotheosis of the new postfactual movement.Taibbi frames the reporting with original essays that explore the seismic shift in how we perceive our national institutions, the democratic process, and the future of the country. Insane Clown President is not just a postmortem on the collapse and failure of American democracy. It offers the riveting, surreal, unique, and essential experience of seeing the future in hindsight.""Scathing . . .

I figli della Repubblica: Un'invettiva,,[],"Maurizio Maggiani ha una predilezione per l’oralità, gli piace sentire e far sentire come il racconto nasca dalla voce, dall’ascolto, dal rapporto che si crea tra la logica dei fatti e l’eco profonda della parola che li restituisce. È questo un segno decisivo dei suoi romanzi e degli incontri con il pubblico dei lettori. Ebbene, qui Maggiani fa un passo avanti e imbocca con rabbia e ardore la via dell’invettiva – un’oralità che sale di volume e di passione oratoria, perché, senza meno, deve ottenere un risultato: andare a segno. L’attenzione si sposta dalla leggenda delle cose accadute allo scacco delle promesse non mantenute. Le promesse fatte dalla sua generazione. Non poteva ben considerarsi beata la gioventù di un dopoguerra che si apriva provvido di speranze, di ideali, di futuro, e di un’alimentazione equilibrata? E allora? Che cosa succede ai figli del privilegio? Che cosa dissipano mentre disegnano un mondo nuovo? Oltre il confine della battaglia combattuta si apre il cedere del sogno, la traduzione dei ribelli in mediocri esecutori, manager, reggicoda di molti poteri. Maggiani amministra colpi con generosità – li chiama maledizioni. E tali sono, maledizioni.

    ?There were times I was a bit reticent in taking out my camera, like when some ?old friends? stopped by to hang out. I didn?t want to intrude on these moments, but John insisted. He felt that I captured him in ways that no one else did because of his comfort level with me?For years, only my closest friends got to see these photos?which were literally tucked away in a shoebox in my closet. They were surprised that these images did not convey the John that was portrayed in the press during our time together. In fact, they saw a side of John seldom seen.??From INSTAMATIC KARMA
    John Lennon is the most famously photographed Beatle?everyone from Iain MacMillian to Annie Lebowitz took iconic images of him?but there have never been pictures of him like these taken by May Pang, Lennon?s girlfriend from 1973 to 1975. In INSTAMATIC KARMA, they?re collected for the first time. With very few exceptions, these photos are that rare thing: never-before-seen images of an icon. The photos here show Lennon in a variety of settings: at work, at play, at home, and away. They show a playful Lennon, a casual, unguarded Lennon; they?re the kind of photos one lover takes of another. May has written rich captions to accompany her photos--taken together, they tell a simple story of the time May and Lennon spent together; a time, according to legend, when Lennon was unhappy and unproductive, estranged from his family and bandmates. Pang?s photos clearly tell another story?they show Lennon clowning around, working on his hit album ?Walls and Bridges?, embracing old friends and family, hanging out in their apartment on Manhattan?s East 52nd Street, relaxing in the country in upstate New York or spending peaceful days swimming in the waters of Long Island. 
    The photographs in INSTAMATIC KARMA are both color and black & white, casual Polaroids and more composed shots. Each one is an intimate glimpse into a fascinating time in John Lennon?s life.

Commonly and callously referred to at the time as the ?Indian Problem, ? this issue, and how it was handled, became the defining factor in shaping how American Indians live today and reflects interestingly on how the American military currently handles conflicts with insurgents throughout the world.

Blake's insightful accounts of these battles finally answers the less pondered, more human questions about this crucial part of America's history.

Now noted military historian Michael Lee Lanning shows how U.S. snipers in Vietnam--combining modern technology in weapons, ammunition, and telescopes--used the experience and traditions of centuries of expert shooters to perfect their craft. To provide insight into the use of American snipers in Vietnam, Lanning interviewed men with combat trigger time, as well as their instructors, the founders of the Marine and U.S. Army sniper programs, and the generals to whom they reported.

Dissecting the economic, political, military and ideological resources available to the US, Mann concludes that they are so uneven as to generate only an ‘incoherent empire’ and increasing world disorder.The US is a military giant, though it is better at devastating than pacifying countries. It is a political schizophrenic, its personality split between multilateralism, unilateralism and an actual inability to rule over foreign lands or to control its own supposed client states. It is only a backseat driver of the global economy. It cannot steer it, but it prods poorer countries toward an unproductive and unpopular neo-liberalism.",,,11/06/03,2005,[],Paperback,,9781844675289,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373996595l/397225.jpg,3.36,[],91.0,1.0,,,,87.0,45.0,278,Verso,"['4', '15', '20', '5', '1']",,[],,['Michael Mann']

PUBLISHER'S NOTE: This book was formerly titled ""IN HER NAME (Omnibus Edition)."" EMPIRE This is the coming-of-age story of Reza Gard, a young boy of the Human Confederation who is swept up in the century-long war with the alien Kreelan Empire. Nightmarish female warriors with blue skin, fangs, and razor sharp talons, the Kreelans have technology that is millennia beyond that of the Confederation, yet they seek out close combat with sword and claw, fighting and dying to honor their god-like Empress. Captured and enslaved, Reza must live like his enemies in a grand experiment to see if humans have souls, and if one may be the key to unlocking an ages old curse upon the Kreelan race. Enduring the brutal conditions of Kreelan life, Reza and a young warrior named Esah-Zhurah find themselves bound together by fate and a prophecy foretold millennia before they were born. CONFEDERATION Banished from the Kreelan Empire, Reza is once again a stranger in a strange land as he returns to the human Confederation. Befriended by a marooned Confederation naval officer leading a desperate fight against the Kreelans on a distant colony world, she reunites Reza with Nicole Carr . With their help, he fulfills his childhood dream of becoming a Confederation Marine. Reza will need all the help he can get, for dark forces are at work at the heart of the Confederation, and Reza becomes a pawn in a lethal power struggle that leads him back to the planet Erlang. There, a heartbreaking reunion awaits him, along with the discovery of an ages-old power that the Kreelan Empire will stop at nothing to control. FINAL BATTLE Reza awakens in a hospital on Earth after having been in a coma for months. Charged with murder and high treason, he finds himself the scapegoat for a daring plot to assassinate the President of the Confederation. Escaping with the help of Jodi Mackenzie, who is now hunted for what she knows about the death of the president, Reza discovers that something is deeply wrong with the Empire: the warriors have lost their will to fight. Compelled to step into a trap set for him and Jodi, the two once again find themselves bound for Erlang. But this time it is to meet Tesh-Dar, who has been captured. When Reza and Jodi are taken prisoner and sentenced to death, they can only watch as a human armada gathers for a strike against the Kreelan homeworld.

Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called ""the Golden State Killer."" Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague.

Identity,A Novel,Fiction,"Milan Kundera's Identity translated from the French by Linda Asher. There are situations in which we fail for a moment to recognize the person we are with, in which the identity of the other is erased while we simultaneously doubt our own. That also happens with couples -- indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else ""losing sight"" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel.

Ignorance,,"['Fiction', 'Czech Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'France', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'Romance', 'European Literature']","A man and a woman meet by chance while returning to their homeland, which they had abandoned twenty years earlier when they had chosen to become exiles. Will they manage to pick up the thread of their strange love story, interrupted almost as soon as it began and then lost in the tides of history? The truth is that after such a long absence ""their memories no longer match."" We always believe that our memories coincide with those of the person we loved, that we experienced the same thing. But this is just an illusion. Then again, what can we expect of our weak memory? It records only ""an insignificant, minuscule particle"" of the past, ""and no one knows why it's this bit and not any other bit."" We live our lives sunk in a vast forgetting, a fact we refuse to recognize. Only those who return after twenty years, like Odysseus returning to his native Ithaca, can be dazzled and astounded by observing the goddess of ignorance firsthand.Milan Kundera is the only author today who can take such dizzying concepts as absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transform them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work.Author Biography: The Franco-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in Brno and has lived in France, his second homeland, for more than twenty years. He is the author of the novels The Joke, Life Is Elsewhere, The Farewell Party, The Books of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and Immortality, and the short story collection Laughable Loves, all originally written in Czech.

In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Survival', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Maritime', 'Adult']","""With its huge, scarred head halfway out of the water and its tail beating the ocean into a white-water wake more than forty feet across, the whale approached the ship at twice its original speed - at least six knots. With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, In the Heart of the Sea will endure as a vital work of American history.",,First Edition,05/08/00,May 1st 2001,"['George Pollard', 'Thomas Nickerson', 'Owen Chase', 'Benjamin Lawrence', 'Matthew Joy', 'Thomas Chappel', 'Owen Coffin', 'Barzillai Ray']",Paperback,,9780141001821,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335902168l/17780.jpg,4.15,"['National Book Award for Nonfiction (2000)', 'Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2001)', 'Massachusetts Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2001)', 'ALA Alex Award (2001)']",788.0,13.0,,,,95.0,84560.0,302,Penguin Books,"['34610', '33321', '12708', '2542', '1379']",,"['Nantucket, Massachusetts (United States)', 'South Pacific']",,['Nathaniel Philbrick']

In eight carefully connected stories that are joined by introspective interludes on related subjects, the author pursues the notion, through the lives of a couple seen by different narrators, that ""those who like unhappy ends can have them, and those who don't will have to look for them.""The impossible object of the title, ""the triangle that can exist in two dimensions but not in three,"" is a controlling symbol for the impossibility of realizing the good life unless one recognizes the impossibility of attaining it: only then can it be possible to realize it, through a kind of renunciation, especially in ""a sophisticated, corrupt, chaotic world.""

'Shorty' is a child of the slums, a teenage boy who has seen enough violence to last a lifetime, and who has been inexorably drawn into the world of the gangsters who rule Site Soleil: men who dole out money with one hand and death with the other. But Shorty has a secret: a flame of revenge that blazes inside him and a burning wish to find the twin sister he lost five years ago. And he is marked. Marked in a way that links him with Toussaint L'Ouverture, the Haitian rebel who two-hundred years ago led the slave revolt and faced down Napoleon to force the French out of Haiti.

Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul and still lives in the family apartment building where his mother first held him in her arms. His portrait of his city is thus also a self-portrait, refracted by memory and the melancholy–or–hüzün–that all Istanbullus share: the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire. With cinematic fluidity, Pamuk moves from his glamorous, unhappy parents to the gorgeous, decrepit mansions overlooking the Bosphorus; from the dawning of his self-consciousness to the writers and painters–both Turkish and foreign–who would shape his consciousness of his city.

Prima il Vietnam, poi Città del Messico e infine la storia d’amore con Alekos Panagulis, eroe della Resistenza greca, simbolo dell’opposizione a qualunque regime liberticida. Dopo la morte di lui e la pubblicazione di Un uomo, Oriana riesce a creare un incantamento globale: vorrebbero essere come lei i tanti giovani e meno giovani attratti dalla personalità dei suoi reportage di guerra e dal suo coraggio. E vorrebbero essere come lei molte donne, per le quali la scrittrice rappresenta la realizzazione di un sogno. In quegli anni la Fallaci accetta i sempre più frequenti inviti a incontrare i suoi lettori stranieri, nelle città e nelle università del mondo. Questo libro raccoglie alcune delle sue conferenze di maggior rilievo, pagine rimaste finora inedite che rivelano il suo rapporto con la scrittura, la sua passione per la politica e per l’impegno civile, la sua “ossessione per la libertà”. È il suo autoritratto più autentico, una sorta di manifesto in cui Oriana rivendica e difende con vigore il diritto a “stare dalla parte dell’umanità, suggerire i cambiamenti, innamorarci dei buoni cambiamenti, influenzare un futuro che sia un futuro migliore del presente”.",,Opere di Oriana Fallaci,,January 2013,[],Hardcover,,9788817061278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357986366l/17234935.jpg,4.19,[],97.0,1.0,,,,99.0,70.0,208,Rizzoli,"['26', '32', '11', '1', '0']",,[],,['Oriana Fallaci']

Intimacy: Trusting Oneself and the Other,,"['Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Love', 'Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Unfinished', 'New Age']","""Hit-and-run"" relationships have become common in our society as it has grown more rootless, less tied to traditional family structures, and more accepting of casual sex. But at the same time, there arises an undercurrent of feeling that something is missing-a quality of intimacy.This quality has very little to do with the physical, though sex is certainly one possible door. Far more important is a willingness to expose our deepest feelings and vulnerabilities, with the trust that the other person will treat them with care. Ultimately, the willingness to take the risk of intimacy has to be grounded in an inner strength that knows that even if the other remains closed, even if that trust is betrayed, we will not suffer any permanent damage.In this gentle and compassionate guide, Osho takes his readers step-by-step through what makes people afraid of intimacy, how to encounter those fears and go beyond them, and what they can do to nourish themselves and their relationships to support more openness and trust.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India.

Intelligence: The Creative Response to Now,,"['Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'New Age', 'Personal Development']","In Intelligence, Osho challenges the common conception that the best way to promote intelligence is to train the intellect. Intellect is logical, he says; intelligence is paradoxical. Intellect takes things apart to see how they work; intelligence puts things together to see the functioning of the whole. Osho posits that when our education systems put too much emphasis on developing intellect, an imbalance is created and both the individual and the society suffer. It is only through intelligence that we can respond creatively to the challenges of a changing world. The Insights for a New Way of Living series aims to shine light on beliefs and attitudes that prevent individuals from being their true selves. The text is an artful mix of compassion and humor, and readers are encouraged to confront what they would most like to avoid, which in turn provides the key to true insight and power.By exploring the distinction between intellect and intelligence, Intelligence encourages readers to be more aware of how they approach problems---logical, emotional, and practical---and how they solve them.Osho challenges the idea that the best way to promote intelligence is to train the intellect.

Il mio inverno a Zerolandia,,"['Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Romance', 'Drama', 'Fiction']","Alessandra ha diciassette anni quando la sua mamma muore dopo una lunga malattia. Rimasta sola con la nonna, torna a scuola decisa a respingere le attenzioni dei compagni che sente estranei, impegnata com'è nella manutenzione del suo dolore. Per questo cambia banco e prende posto vicino a Gabriele detto Zero, la nullità della classe: desidera solo essere ignorata dagli altri, come succede a lui. Ma Zero è più interessante di quanto sembra. Ha una gran passione e un vero talento per il disegno; nella sua apparente noncuranza è attento e sensibile; è lui a soccorrere Ale sbucando inaspettato al suo fianco quando lei ha bisogno di aiuto. Piano piano un sentimento indefinibile prende forma tra le pareti della classe e la spiaggia d'inverno, grigi fondali di una storia semplice e complicata insieme: perché Alessandra è tanto lucida nel rivisitare il ricordo della madre quanto confusa nel prendere le misure di se stessa e di ciò che prova. E Gabriele è abilissimo a sparire proprio quando lei scopre di volerlo vicino.

Il nero e l'argento,,"['Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Contemporary', 'Literature', 'Drama', 'Roman', 'Family', 'Novels', 'Audiobook']","Questa è la storia di un amore giovane. Di una coppia felice e inesperta, spaventata di scoprire, giorno dopo giorno, le molteplici forme dell’abbandono. Perché anche le famiglie possono soffrire di solitudine, proprio come le persone. Ad accudire in silenzio tutte le incertezze, oltre a prendersi cura del loro bambino, ci ha sempre pensato la signora A. Per questo, quando arriva un male a portarsela via, si spalanca in casa un vuoto improvviso. Nora e suo marito devono ancora accorgersi che il coraggio della signora A., ormai, appartiene anche a loro.È dentro le stanze che le famiglie crescono: strepitanti, incerte, allegre, spaventate. Giovani coppie alle prime armi, pronte ad abbracciarsi o a perdersi. Come Nora e suo marito. Ma di quelle stanze bisogna prima o poi spalancare porte e finestre, aprirsi al tempo che passa, all’aria di fuori. «A lungo andare ogni amore ha bisogno di qualcuno che lo veda e riconosca, che lo avvalori, altrimenti rischia di essere scambiato per un malinteso». È cosí che la signora A., nell'attimo stesso in cui entra in casa per occuparsi delle faccende domestiche, diventa la custode di una relazione, la bussola per orientarsi nella bonaccia e nella burrasca. Con le pantofole allineate accanto alla porta e gli scontrini esatti al centesimo, l’appropriazione indebita della cucina e i pochi tesori di una sua vita segreta, appare fin da subito solida, testarda, magica, incrollabile. «La signora A. era la sola vera testimone dell’impresa che compivamo giorno dopo giorno, la sola testimone del legame che ci univa. Senza il suo sguardo ci sentivamo in pericolo». Ci sono molti modi per raccontare una storia d’amore. Paolo Giordano ha scelto la via piú sensibile: registrare come un sismografo le scosse del quotidiano, gli slanci e i dolori, l’incapacità e il desiderio.

Before long, Walker finds himself caught in a perverse triangle that leads to a sudden, shocking act of violence that will alter the course of his life.Three different narrators tell the story of Invisible, a novel that travels in time from 1967 to 2007 and moves from Morningside Heights, to the Left Bank of Paris, to a remote island in the Caribbean. It is a book of youthful rage, unbridled sexual hunger, and a relentless quest for justice. With uncompromising insight, Auster takes us into the shadowy borderland between truth and memory, between authorship and identity, to produce a work of unforgettable power that confirms his reputation as “one of America’s most spectacularly inventive writers.” ",,,10/28/09,October 27th 2009,"['Adam Walker', 'Gwyn Walker', 'Rudolf Born', 'James Freeman']",Hardcover,,9780805090802,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317063578l/6345193.jpg,3.68,['International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2011)'],1181.0,13.0,,,,89.0,18926.0,308,Henry Holt and Co.,"['3787', '7848', '5287', '1458', '546']",,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Paris (France)']",,['Paul Auster']

Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call ""twenty-first-century free women."" All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mall and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard to define work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities. Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, ""if you want to make God laugh, make plans."" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress...",Idlewild #2,,07/01/01,July 9th 2002,[],Kindle Edition,,9780380804887,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442876071l/771493._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],97.0,1.0,,,,95.0,3157.0,323,HarperCollins Publishers,"['1278', '1105', '622', '122', '30']",,[],,['Pearl Cleage']

They now explore the implications of this belief, and its power to change every area of our lives. They attempt to answer one question: If we took God′s love seriously, what would our world look like?Gulley and Mulholland argue that what we believe is crucial and dramatically affects the way we live and interact in the world. Beliefs have power. The belief in a literal hell where people suffer eternally has often been used by the Church to justify hate and violence, which contradicts what Jesus taught about love and grace. The authors present a new vision for our personal, religious, and corporate lives, exploring what our world would be like if we based our existence on the foundational truth that God loves every person.Gulley and Mulholland boldly address many controversial issues people in the pews have wondered about but churches have been unwilling to tackle.

I Married a Communist,,"['Fiction', 'American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'The United States Of America', 'Contemporary', 'Politics', 'Americana']","I Married a Communist is the story of the rise and fall of Ira Ringold, a big American roughneck who begins life as a teenage ditch-digger in 1930s Newark, becomes a big-time 1940s radio star, and is destroyed, as both a performer and a man, in the McCarthy witchhunt of the 1950s.In his heyday as a star—and as a zealous, bullying supporter of ""progressive"" political causes—Ira marries Hollywood's beloved silent-film star, Eve Frame. Their glamorous honeymoon in her Manhattan townhouse is shortlived, however, and it is the publication of Eve's scandalous bestselling exposé that identifies him as ""an American taking his orders from Moscow.""In this story of cruelty, betrayal, and revenge spilling over into the public arena from their origins in Ira's turbulent personal life, Philip Roth—who Commonweal calls the ""master chronicler of the American twentieth century—has written a brilliant fictional portrayal of that treacherous postwar epoch when the anti-Communist fever not only infected national politics but traumatized the intimate, innermost lives of friends and families, husbands and wives, parents and children.",The American Trilogy #2,,10/22/98,November 2nd 1999,['Nathan Zuckerman'],Paperback,,9780375707216,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390275847l/11653.jpg,3.82,"['Ambassador Book Award for Fiction (1999)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (1998)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2000)']",181.0,2.0,,,,93.0,6998.0,323,Vintage,"['1661', '3014', '1821', '424', '78']",,['United States of America'],,['Philip Roth']
Indignation,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Literature', 'Coming Of Age', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'The United States Of America']","Against the backdrop of the Korean War, a young man faces life’s unimagined chances and terrifying consequences.It is 1951 in America, the second year of the Korean War. A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio’s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father’s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.Indignation, Philip Roth’s twenty-ninth book, is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.",,1st edition,,September 5th 2008,['Marcus Messner'],Hardcover,,9780547054841,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348256144l/3015764.jpg,3.74,['Κρατικό Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης for Μετάφραση Έργου Ξένης Λογοτεχνίας στην Ελληνική Γλώσσα (2010)'],140.0,2.0,,,,92.0,14352.0,235,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['2923', '6134', '4108', '976', '211']",,"['Newark, New Jersey (United States)', 'New Jersey (United States)']",,['Philip Roth']
Inner Grace: Augustine in the Traditions of Plato and Paul,,[],"This book is, along with Outward Signs (OUP 2008), a sequel to Phillip Cary's Augustine and the Invention of the Inner Self (OUP 2000). In this work, Cary traces the development of Augustine's epochal doctrine of grace, arguing that it does not represent a rejection of Platonism in favor of a more purely Christian point of view a turning from Plato to Paul, as it is often portrayed. Instead, Augustine reads Paul and other Biblical texts in light of his Christian Platonist inwardness, producing a new concept of grace as an essentially inward gift. For Augustine, grace is needed first of all to heal the mind so it may see God, but then also to help the will turn away from lower goods to love God as its eternal Good. Eventually, over the course of Augustine's career, the scope of the soul's need for grace expands outward to include not only the inner vision of the intellect and the power of love but even the initial gift of faith.At every stage, Augustine insists that divine grace does not compromise or coerce the human will but frees, heals, and helps it, precisely because grace is not an external force but an inner gift of delight leading to true happiness. As his polemic against the Pelagians develops, however, he does attribute more to grace and less to the power of free will. In the end, it is God's choice which makes the ultimate difference between the saved and the damned, and we cannot know why he chooses to save one person and not another. From this Augustinian doctrine of divine choice or election stem the characteristic pastoral problems of predestination, especially in Protestantism. A more external, indeed Jewish, doctrine of election would be more Biblical, Cary suggests, and would result in a less anxious experience of grace.Along with its companion work, Outward Signs, this careful and insightful book breaks new ground in the study of Augustine's theology of grace and sacraments.",,,02/27/08,March 26th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780195336481,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348540801l/3284107.jpg,4.09,[],87.0,1.0,,,,100.0,11.0,189,"Oxford University Press, USA","['4', '4', '3', '0', '0']",,[],,['Phillip Cary']

For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it. Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions.

Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Journalism', 'Military History', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'American']","An unprecedented account of life in Baghdad’s Green Zone, a walled-off enclave of towering plants, posh villas, and sparkling swimming pools that was the headquarters for the American occupation of Iraq.The Washington Post’s former Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran takes us with him into the Zone: into a bubble, cut off from wartime realities, where the task of reconstructing a devastated nation competed with the distractions of a Little America—a half-dozen bars stocked with cold beer, a disco where women showed up in hot pants, a movie theater that screened shoot-’em-up films, an all-you-could-eat buffet piled high with pork, a shopping mall that sold pornographic movies, a parking lot filled with shiny new SUVs, and a snappy dry-cleaning service—much of it run by Halliburton. Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country. In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions—a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency. Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik’s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad’s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on Roe v. Wade; people with prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer’s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule. This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government’s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.",,,2006,September 19th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9781400044870,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184155l/22121.jpg,4.03,"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2007)', 'Ridenhour Book Prize (2007)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2007)', 'Cornelius Ryan Award (2006)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2006)']",1.0,1.0,,,,95.0,5666.0,320,Knopf,"['1812', '2500', '1096', '211', '47']",,[],,['Rajiv Chandrasekaran']

Ich fragte nicht weiter nach, hätte wohl auch, wie so oft, wenn es um die Zeit ging, keine genauere Antwort bekommen. Die stellte sich erst ein, als ich Jahrzehnte später Fotos von Soldatengräbern in der Hand hielt und sah, dass viele Kreuze hinter der Front aus jungen Birkenstämmen gemacht waren.« Im Frühling sterben ist die Geschichte von Walter Urban und Friedrich – »Fiete« – Caroli, zwei siebzehnjährigen Melkern aus Norddeutschland, die im Februar 1945 zwangsrekrutiert werden. Während man den einen als Fahrer in der Versorgungseinheit der Waffen-SS einsetzt, muss der andere,Fiete, an die Front. Er desertiert, wird gefasst und zum Tod verurteilt, und Walter, dessen zynischer Vorgesetzter nicht mit sich redenlässt steht plötzlich mit dem Karabiner im Anschlag vor seinem besten Freund ...

For not only does Ralph Ellison's nightmare journey across the racial divide tell unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators, it gives us an entirely new model of what a novel can be.As he journeys from the Deep South to the streets and basements of Harlem, from a horrifying ""battle royal"" where black men are reduced to fighting animals, to a Communist rally where they are elevated to the status of trophies, Ralph Ellison's nameless protagonist ushers readers into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief.

But after her first visit, Dr. Awdish spent months fighting for her life, enduring consecutive major surgeries and experiencing multiple overlapping organ failures. At each step of the recovery process, Awdish was faced with something even more unexpected: repeated cavalier behavior from her fellow physicians—indifference following human loss, disregard for anguish and suffering, and an exacting emotional distance.Hauntingly perceptive and beautifully written, In Shock allows the reader to transform alongside Awidsh and watch what she discovers in our carefully-cultivated, yet often misguided, standard of care. Awdish comes to understand the fatal flaws in her profession and in her own past actions as a physician while achieving, through unflinching presence, a crystalline vision of a new and better possibility for us all.As Dr. Awdish finds herself up against the same self-protective partitions she was trained to construct as a medical student and physician, she artfully illuminates the dysfunction of disconnection. Shatteringly personal, and yet wholly universal, she offers a brave road map for anyone navigating illness while presenting physicians with a new paradigm and rationale for embracing the emotional bond between doctor and patient.",,,,October 24th 2017,[],Hardcover,,9781250119216,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497960106l/33574173.jpg,4.36,[],97.0,1.0,,,,97.0,3671.0,272,St. Martin's Press,"['1935', '1231', '404', '78', '23']",,[],,['Rana Awdish']

In China's Shadow: The Crisis of American Entrepreneurship,,[],"This book begins with an eye-opening exploration of the rise of China’s economy and an assessment of its potential for further rapid growth. The implications of China’s new power are nothing short of profound, Reed Hundt contends. In China's Shadow proceeds to paint a detailed landscape of the new reality confronting American businesses and citizens. For the first time in over one hundred years, Americans face critical challenges to their economy and way of life owing not only to China’s impending economic might but also to the drift of U.S. business practices and government regulations over the past decade.Aiming for a respectable defeat in the competition of nations will imperil not only the American Dream of an ever-increasing standard of living but also the American project itself, Hundt warns. Meeting the foreseeable challenges is not a matter of legislative strategy from the political left or right or prescriptive plans for businesses. The best chance for Americans to lead the world in job and wealth creation lies in an expanded and renewed culture of entrepreneurship. Hundt reviews the lessons of the 1990s, when the architectures of law, technology, and leadership produced a robust culture of entrepreneurship, and analyzes how entrepreneurship is being undermined today. He challenges Americans to do what they do best—adapt, invent, innovate, take risks—and points the way for a reinvigorated entrepreneurial society.",,,,October 16th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9780300108521,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328869913l/178820.jpg,3.83,[],37.0,1.0,,,,100.0,6.0,208,Yale University Press,"['1', '3', '2', '0', '0']",,[],,['Reed Hundt']

In the years that followed, she published other notable monographs, including ""Aila"" (2004), ""The Eyes, the Ear"" (2005) and ""Semear"" (2007). And now, ten years after her precipitous entry onto the international stage, Aperture has published ""Illuminance,"" the latest volume of Kawauchi's work and the first to be published outside of Japan. Kawauchi's photography has frequently been lauded for its nuanced palette and offhand compositional mastery, as well as its ability to incite wonder via careful attention to tiny gestures and the incidental details of her everyday environment. As Sean O'Hagan, writing in ""The Guardian"" in 2006, noted, ""there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile."" In ""Illuminance,"" Kawauchi continues her exploration of the extraordinary in the mundane, drawn to the fundamental cycles of life and the seemingly inadvertent, fractal-like organization of the natural world into formal patterns.

Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Italy', 'Thriller', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'Roman', 'Classics']","When Tiro, the confidential secretary (and slave) of a Roman senator, opens the door to a terrified stranger on a cold November morning, he sets in motion a chain of events that will eventually propel his master into one of the most suspenseful courtroom dramas in history. The stranger is a Sicilian, a victim of the island's corrupt Roman governor, Verres. The senator is Marcus Cicero—an ambitious young lawyer and spellbinding orator, who at the age of twenty-seven is determined to attain imperium—supreme power in the state. Of all the great figures of the Roman world, none was more fascinating or charismatic than Cicero. And Tiro—the inventor of shorthand and author of numerous books, including a celebrated biography of his master (which was lost in the Dark Ages)—was always by his side. Compellingly written in Tiro's voice, Imperium is the re-creation of his vanished masterpiece, recounting in vivid detail the story of Cicero's quest for glory, competing with some of the most powerful and intimidating figures of his—or any other—age: Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, and the many other powerful Romans who changed history. Robert Harris, the world's master of innovative historical fiction, lures us into a violent, treacherous world of Roman politics at once exotically different from and yet startlingly similar to our own—a world of Senate intrigue and electoral corruption, special prosecutors and political adventurism—to describe how one clever, compassionate, devious, vulnerable man fought to reach the top.",Cicero #1,First Edition,,September 19th 2006,"['Tiro', 'Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus', 'Marcus Licinius Crassus', 'Julius Caesar', 'Marcus Tullius Cicero']",Hardcover,,9780743266031,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442657816l/243601._SY475_.jpg,4.09,[],478.0,6.0,,,,96.0,26396.0,305,Simon & Schuster,"['9409', '11261', '4604', '838', '284']",,"['Italy', 'Rome (Italy)']",,['Robert Harris']

Saudi Arabia is a country defined by paradox. It's a modern state driven by contemporary technology & possessed of vast oil deposits, yet its powerful religious establishment would have its customs & practices rolled back 1000 years to match those of the prophet Muhammad. With Inside the Kingdom, journalist & bestselling author Robert Lacey has given us one of the most penetrating & insightful looks at Saudi Arabia ever produced. While living for years among the nation's princes & paupers, its clerics & progressives, Lacey endeavored to find out how the consequences of the 1970s oil boom produced a society at war with itself. Filled with stories that trace a path thru the Persian Gulf War & the events of 9/11 to the oilmarket convulsions of today, Inside the Kingdom gives a modern history of the Saudis in their own words, revealing a people attempting to reconcile life under religious law with the demands of a rapidly changing world.

According to Llinas, the mindness state evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the sea squirt. The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function.

È vero, tanto tempo è passato, da quando vissero Ernest, il narratore di questo libro, con la sua ingegnosa famiglia, dal padre Edward, che fu senza dubbio «il più grande uomo scimmia del Pleistocene», a quell’amabile reazionario di zio Vania, che tornava sempre a vivere sugli alberi, a quel viaggiatore incallito dello zio Ian, per non parlare delle ragazze. Un curioso gruppetto, che si trovò, sotto la guida del grande Edward, nella delicata situazione di chi dà all’evoluzione una spinta che non si riequilibrerà mai: la spinta da cui siamo nati tutti noi. Ragionando con impeccabile acume scientifico, nonché un delizioso humour freddo, Edward e i suoi scoprirono «alcune delle cose più potenti e spaventose su cui la razza umana abbia mai messo le mani: il fuoco, la lancia, il matrimonio e così via», sempre sulla base di una elementare esigenza: quella di «cucinare senza essere cucinati e mangiare senza essere mangiati». E naturalmente non mancarono le dispute e i crucci, perché ogni volta si poteva discutere se quelle nuove invenzioni erano davvero buone o cattive, se non rischiavano di sfuggire al controllo e soprattutto se non andavano un po’ troppo contro la natura. Mah...Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1960, e poi ripreso più volte sotto vari titoli, questo libro si è fatto strada silenziosamente fra i classici della fantascienza a ritroso. Ma in realtà è un libro inclassificabile: una riflessione romanzesca, acutissima e leggera, su tutta la storia dell’umanità, contrassegnata in ogni dettaglio da quella limpidezza e da quell’ironia che appartengono alla migliore tradizione letteraria e scientifica inglese. Quando Théodore Monod lesse questo libro, segnalò all’autore uno o due errori tecnici, subito aggiungendo «che non importavano un accidente, perché la lettura del libro l’aveva fatto ridere tanto che era caduto da un cammello nel bel mezzo del Sahara».",,Gli Adelphi #182,11/05/60,2001,[],Paperback,,9788845915918,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344463575l/4590678.jpg,3.71,[],78.0,1.0,,,,89.0,4657.0,178,Adelphi,"['1081', '1777', '1287', '407', '105']",,[],,"['Roy Lewis', 'Terry Pratchett', 'Carlo Brera']"

Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid.With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her.Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan's court. But Fiammetta and Bucino's greatest challenge comes from a young crippled woman, a blind healer who insinuates herself into their lives and hearts with devastating consequences for them all.A story of desire and deception, sin and religion, loyalty and friendship, In the Company of the Courtesan paints a portrait of one of the world's greatest cities at its most potent moment in history: It is a picture that remains vivid long after the final page.",,,10/28/06,February 6th 2007,[],Paperback,,9780812974041,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924737l/62212.jpg,3.77,[],255.0,3.0,,,,92.0,23776.0,368,Random House Trade,"['5817', '9178', '6803', '1521', '457']",,"['Venice (Italy)', 'Rome (Italy)']",,['Sarah Dunant']

Here is a thrilling exploration of the House of Borgia's doomed years, in the company of a young diplomat named Niccolo Machiavelli. It is 1502 and Rodrigo Borgia, a self-confessed womaniser and master of political corruption is now on the Papal throne as Alexander VI. His daughter Lucrezia, aged twenty-two, already thrice married and a pawn in her father's plans, is discovering her own power. And then there is Cesare Borgia: brilliant, ruthless and increasingly unstable; it is his relationship with the diplomat Machiavelli which offers a master class on the dark arts of power and politics. What Machiavelli learns will go on to inform his great work of modern politics, The Prince. But while the pope rails against old age and his son's increasing maverick behavior it is Lucrezia who will become the Borgia survivor: taking on her enemies and creating her own place in history.Conjuring up the past in all its complexity, horror and pleasures, In The Name of the Family confirms Sarah Dunant's place as the leading novelist of the Renaissance and one of the most acclaimed historical fiction writers of our age.",Borgias #2,,,February 28th 2017,"['Cesare Borgia', 'Niccolò Machiavelli', 'Lucrezia Borgia', 'Pope Alexander VI']",Hardcover,,9781844087464,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481712874l/30375755.jpg,3.75,[],99.0,1.0,,,,92.0,2938.0,453,Virago,"['648', '1176', '885', '177', '52']",,[],,['Sarah Dunant']

Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope,,"['Nonfiction', 'Iran', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'History', 'Politics', 'Feminism', 'Biography Memoir', 'Islam', 'Autobiography']","The moving, inspiring memoir of one of the great women of our times, Shirin Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and advocate for the oppressed, whose spirit has remained strong in the face of political persecution and despite the challenges she has faced raising a family while pursuing her work. Best known in this country as the lawyer working tirelessly on behalf of Canadian photojournalist, Zara Kazemi - raped, tortured and murdered in Iran - Dr. Ebadi offers us a vivid picture of the struggles of one woman against the system. The book movingly chronicles her childhood in a loving, untraditional family, her upbringing before the Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah, her marriage and her religious faith, as well as her life as a mother and lawyer battling an oppressive regime in the courts while bringing up her girls at home. Outspoken, controversial, Shirin Ebadi is one of the most fascinating women today. She rose quickly to become the first female judge in the country; but when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges she was demoted to clerk in the courtroom she had once presided over. She eventually fought her way back as a human rights lawyer, defending women and children in politically charged cases that most lawyers were afraid to represent. She has been arrested and been the target of assassination, but through it all has spoken out with quiet bravery on behalf of the victims of injustice and discrimination and become a powerful voice for change, almost universally embraced as a hero. Her memoir is a gripping story - a must-read for anyone interested in Zara Kazemi's case, in the life of a remarkable woman, or in understandingthe political and religious upheaval in our world.",,,01/01/06,May 2nd 2006,[],Hardcover,,9781400064700,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389480470l/7580.jpg,4.14,[],181.0,2.0,,,,96.0,4714.0,232,Random House (NY),"['1923', '1807', '779', '147', '58']",,[],,['Shirin Ebadi']

As Chief of Surgical Oncology at Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Steven Curley has worked with cancer patients for over two decades. While his life's work has been to help his patients live longer lives, he found that they helped him in ways he never could have expected. IN MY HANDS is a rare, often emotional look at some of Dr. Curley's real patients and real situations in modern cancer care. These stories of resilience, hope, and determination changed and inspired Dr. Curley, and he uses these same stories to encourage patients dealing with the fear and uncertainty coupled with a diagnosis of cancer. Every story in the book has a theme inspired by his patients: Hope, Courage, Strength, Determination, Wonder, Cooperation, Creativity, Diligence, Service, Perseverance, Wisdom, Grace, Consideration, Gratitude, Discernment, Reverence, Resourcefulness, Faith, Beauty, Acceptance, and Empathy. Some are positive messages, reminding us of the importance of maintaining balance between family, work, and leisure activities. Others are examples of the remarkable resilience of the human spirit when facing the reality of and the surgical risks that accompany a cancer diagnosis. Realistically, despite remarkable advances in multidisciplinary cancer care, some remind us cancer is still a potentially lethal and destructive disease affecting patients and the family and friends supporting them. While many people are told that there is no hope in their situation, Dr. Curley's patients taught him to always provide hope, to push the envelope and give people a chance, and that hope is a critical component of treatment and care.

He built a temple at Jerusalem that was said to be more fabulous than any other landmark in the ancient world, heavily adorned with gold from Ophir. The precise location of this legendary land has been one of history's great unsolved mysteries. Long before Rider Haggard's classic adventure novel King Solomon's Mines produced a fresh outbreak of gold fever, explorers, scientists and theologians had scoured the world for the source of the king's astonishing wealth. Tahir Shah takes up the quest, using as his leads a mixture of texts including the Septuagint, the earliest form of the Bible, as well as geological, geographical and folkloric sources. Time and again the evidence points towards Ethiopia, the ancient kingdom in the horn of Africa whose imperial family claims descent from Menelik, the son born to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Tahir Shah's trail takes him to a remote cliff-face monastery where the monks pull visitors up on a leather rope, to the ruined castles of Gondar, and to the churches of Lalibela, hewn from solid rock.In the south, he discovers an enormous illegal gold mine where thousands of men, women and children dig with their hands.

In the Footsteps of the Prophet: Lessons from the Life of Muhammad,,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Self Help', 'Biography Memoir']","Named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important innovators of the century, Tariq Ramadan is a leading Muslim scholar, with a large following especially among young European and American Muslims. Now, in his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous biography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual and ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history.In the Footsteps of the Prophet is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a life that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan provides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but determined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched a great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan presents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that highlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores the significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most controversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of women, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with other religions. Selecting those facts and stories from which we can draw a profound and vivid spiritual picture, the author asks how can the Prophet's life remain -- or become again -- an example, a model, and an inspiration? And how can Muslims move from formalism -- a fixation on ritual -- toward a committed spiritual and social presence?In this thoughtful and engaging biography, Ramadan offers Muslims a new understanding of Muhammad's life and he introduces non-Muslims not just to the story of the Prophet, but to the spiritual and ethical riches of Islam.",,,,February 1st 2007,['Mohammad and his family'],Hardcover,,9780195308808,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387739361l/169338.jpg,4.43,[],96.0,1.0,,,,96.0,3810.0,242,"Oxford University Press, USA","['2352', '954', '366', '84', '54']",,[],,['Tariq Ramadan']

In Leah's Wake,,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Drama', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Womens Fiction', 'Adult', 'Mystery']","A Story of Love, Loss, Connection, and GraceAt the heart of the seemingly perfect Tyler family stands sixteen-year-old Leah. Her proud parents are happily married, successful professionals. Her adoring younger sister is wise and responsible beyond her years. And Leah herself is a talented athlete with a bright collegiate future. But living out her father’s lost dreams, and living up to her sister’s worshipful expectations, is no easy task for a teenager. And when temptation enters her life in the form of drugs, desire, and a dangerously exciting boy, Leah’s world turns on a dime from idyllic to chaotic to nearly tragic.As Leah’s conflicted emotions take their toll on those she loves—turning them against each other and pushing them to destructive extremes—In Leah’s Wake powerfully explores one of fiction’s most enduring themes: the struggle of teenagers coming of age, and coming to terms with the overwhelming feelings that rule them and the demanding world that challenges them. Terri Giuliano Long’s skillfully styled and insightfully informed debut novel captures the intensely personal tragedies, victories, and revelations each new generation faces during those tumultuous transitional years.Recipient of multiple awards and honors, In Leah’s Wake is a compelling and satisfying reading experience with important truths to share—by a new author with the voice of a natural storyteller and an unfailingly keen understanding of the human condition…at every age.Nominated Global eBook Award (New Edition, 2012)Book Bundlz 2011 Book PickBook Bundlz Book Club 2011 Favorites - First Place",,,,October 1st 2010,[],Paperback,,9781456310547,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1307033996l/9791117.jpg,3.22,"['IndieReader Discovery Award (IRDA) for Literary Fiction (Tie) (2012)', 'Global Ebook Awards Nominee (2012)']",92.0,1.0,,,,76.0,2840.0,368,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,"['358', '750', '1055', '505', '172']",,[],,['Terri Giuliano Long']

Yet far to the north, the evil Warlock Lord has dispatched shadowy Skull Bearers, creatures twisted by dark sorcery, to hunt him down. At the same time, a black-cloaked giant of a man appears in Shady Vale. He claims to be the mysterious Druid known as Allanon, a wizardly wanderer of vast knowledge and power–and he has come to see Shea. For Shea, he says, is the last descendant of an ancient Elven king. Only he, in all the world, can wield the fabled Sword of Shannara. And only the Sword can stop the Warlock Lord from destroying all that lives.The Sword lies far from Shady Vale, in the Druid castle of Paranor. And Paranor has fallen under the shadow of the Warlock Lord. Yet all is not lost. Shea will rise to the challenge.

A thousand years of savagery and barbarism have concluded at the start the series with the emergence of a new civilization in which magic has replaced science as the dominant source of power. A Druid Council comprised of the most talented of the new races–Men, Dwarves, Trolls, Gnomes, and Elves, names taken from the old legends–has begun the arduous task of rebuilding the world and putting an end to the racial warfare that has consumed the survivors of the so-called Great Wars since their conclusion.But the wars continue, albeit in a different form. Magic, like science, is often mercurial, can be used for good or evil, and can have a positive or negative effect on those who come in contact with it. In The Sword of Shannara, a Druid subverted by his craving for magic’ s power manipulated Trolls and Gnomes in his effort to gain mastery over the other races. He failed because of Shea Ohmsford, the last of an Elven family with the Shannara surname. Shea, with the help of his brother and a small band of companions, was able to wield the fabled Sword of Shannara to destroy the Dark Lord. Subsequently, in the Elfstones of the Shannara, his grandson Wil was faced with another sort of challenge, one that required the use of a magic contained in a set of Elfstones. But use of the Stones altered Wil’s genetic makeup, so that his own children were born with magic in their blood. As a result, in the third book of the series, the Wishsong of Shannara, Brin and her brother Jair were recruited by the Druid Allanon to seek out and destroy the Ildatch, the book of dark magic that had subverted the Warlock Lord, and was now doing the same with the Mord wraiths.The story that follows takes place several years after the conclusion of The Wishsong and again features Jair Ohmsford, who must come to terms with his obsession with the past and his use of his magic that his sister has warned him not to trust...Indomitable by Terry Brooks, appearing soon in the Legends II anthology.

At some stage early in our lives we adopt a “position” about ourselves which very significantly determines how we feel about ourselves, particularly in relation to other people.

Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that ""love"" is another of those words going around at the moment, like ""trip"" or ""groovy,"" except that this one usually leads to trouble.

Intellectuals and Society,,"['Politics', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Cultural', 'Society', 'Education', 'Psychology']","The influence of intellectuals is not only greater than in previous eras but also takes a very different form from that envisioned by those like Machiavelli and others who have wanted to directly influence rulers. It has not been by shaping the opinions or directing the actions of the holders of power that modern intellectuals have most influenced the course of events, but by shaping public opinion in ways that affect the actions of power holders in democratic societies, whether or not those power holders accept the general vision or the particular policies favored by intellectuals. Even government leaders with disdain or contempt for intellectuals have had to bend to the climate of opinion shaped by those intellectuals.Intellectuals and Society not only examines the track record of intellectuals in the things they have advocated but also analyzes the incentives and constraints under which their views and visions have emerged. One of the most surprising aspects of this study is how often intellectuals have been proved not only wrong, but grossly and disastrously wrong in their prescriptions for the ills of society—and how little their views have changed in response to empirical evidence of the disasters entailed by those views.",,,12/10/09,January 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780465019489,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440646714l/7285385._SY475_.jpg,4.26,[],48.0,1.0,,,,93.0,2278.0,398,Basic Books (AZ),"['1217', '660', '241', '92', '68']",,[],,['Thomas Sowell']
Intellectuals and Race,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'History', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural', 'Society']","Thomas Sowell's incisive critique of the intellectuals' destructive role in shaping ideas about race in America Intellectuals and Race is a radical book in the original sense of one that goes to the root of the problem. The role of intellectuals in racial strife is explored in an international context that puts the American experience in a wholly new light.  The views of individual intellectuals have spanned the spectrum, but the views of intellectuals as a whole have tended to cluster. Indeed, these views have clustered at one end of the spectrum in the early twentieth century and then clustered at the opposite end of the spectrum in the late twentieth century. Moreover, these radically different views of race in these two eras were held by intellectuals whose views on other issues were very similar in both eras. Intellectuals and Race is not, however, a book about history, even though it has much historical evidence, as well as demographic, geographic, economic and statistical evidence -- all of it directed toward testing the underlying assumptions about race that have prevailed at times among intellectuals in general, and especially intellectuals at the highest levels. Nor is this simply a theoretical exercise. The impact of intellectuals' ideas and crusades on the larger society, both past and present, is the ultimate concern. These ideas and crusades have ranged widely from racial theories of intelligence to eugenics to ""social justice"" and multiculturalism.  In addition to in-depth examinations of these and other issues, Intellectuals and Race explores the incentives, the visions and the rationales that drive intellectuals at the highest levels to conclusions that have often turned out to be counterproductive and even disastrous, not only for particular racial or ethnic groups, but for societies as a whole.",,,,March 12th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780465058723,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357613803l/16280863.jpg,4.38,[],22.0,1.0,,,,96.0,803.0,192,Basic Books,"['456', '243', '70', '24', '10']",,[],,['Thomas Sowell']

While she was there, she began to understand the fate that awaited the Jewish families who were unable to leave. Soon she reached out to the trapped families, going from door to door and asking them to trust her with their young children. Driven to extreme measures and with the help of a network of local tradesmen, ghetto residents, and her star-crossed lover in the Jewish resistance, Irena ultimately smuggled thousands of children past the Nazis. She made dangerous trips through the city’s sewers, hid children in coffins, snuck them under overcoats at checkpoints, and slipped them through secret passages in abandoned buildings. But Irena did something even more astonishing at immense personal risk: she kept a secret list buried in bottles under an old apple tree in a friend’s back garden. On it were the names and true identities of these Jewish children, recorded so their families could find them after the war. She could not know that more than ninety percent of their families would perish.

If They Can't Take a Joke: Confrontational Humor for the Casual Bibliophile,,[],"Critically lauded Buffalo humor writer Tom Waters sharpens his craft with essays to razor precision in his fourth published collection of wickedly subversive and laugh out loud rants, essays, and celebrity interviews. The author reloads his calculated wit on topics like babies, pornography, restaurants, relationships, driving, wrestling, coffee addiction, weight gain, psychotherapy, writers portrayed in film, the eroding laziness of our culture, drive-thrus, cooking, republicans, and the agony of shopping for clothes with women. The collection also reprints some of Tom's most popular celebrity interviews with author Bret Easton Ellis, comic legends Mike Carey and Brian Azzarello and cult film director Lloyd Kaufman. Waters has enjoyed a rabid cult following among his fans and continues to shock, amuse, and offend with his no-nonsense brand of confrontational rants. Compared as a cross between Andy Rooney, Dennis Miller and Denis Leary, his angst-fueled nonfiction endures as a legacy to the Y generation, an amusing threat to baby boomers, and an inspiration to angry young men the world over. His books and articles have appeared in over four countries and have thus far sold thousands of copies.

Judt offers the language we need to address our common needs, rejecting the nihilistic individualism of the far right and the debunked socialism of the past. To find a way forward, we must look to our not so distant past and to social democracy in action: to re-enshrining fairness over mere efficiency.Distinctly absent from our national dialogue, social democrats believe that the state can play an enhanced role in our lives without threatening our liberties. Instead of placing blind faith in the market—as we have to our detriment for the past thirty years—social democrats entrust their fellow citizens and the state itself.Ill Fares the Land challenges us to confront our societal ills and to shoulder responsibility for the world we live in. For hope remains. In reintroducing alternatives to the status quo, Judt reinvigorates our political conversation, providing the tools necessary to imagine a new form of governance, a new way of life.",,,10/30/10,March 18th 2010,"['Bill Clinton', 'John Maynard Keynes', 'Tony Blair', 'Benito Mussolini', 'Barack Obama', 'Malcolm X', 'George Orwell', 'Joseph McCarthy', 'Milton Friedman', 'Gordon Brown', 'Friedrich Hayek', 'Lyndon B.

E ci parla in prima persona, raccontandosi con tutta l'umanità e il coraggio che lo hanno reso, lungo ventisette secoli, più immortale di un dio.Dalla nascita nella piccola, rocciosa Itaca alla formazione di uomo e di guerriero al fianco del padre Laerte, dalle braccia materne della nutrice Euriclea al vasto mare da navigare sino a Sparta, dalla abbagliante e pericolosa bellezza di Elena all'amore per Penelope, dal solenne giuramento tra giovani principi leali al divampare della tremenda discordia: questo romanzo, primo di due volumi, segue Odysseo fino alla resa di Troia, grandiosa e terribile. Prima ancora che inizi il nòstos - lo straordinario viaggio di ritorno - l'avventura già è costellata di incontri folgoranti, segnata da crisi profonde, dominata dall'intelligenza e dall'ardimento di un uomo capace, passo dopo passo, di farsi eroe.La figura di Odysseo ha avuto lo straordinario destino di ""reincarnarsi"" infinite volte: i più grandi poeti lo hanno cantato, la sua orma profonda e sempre nuova è riconoscibile nei testi più importanti della letteratura di ogni tempo, a ogni latitudine. Tutti noi abbiamo la sensazione di ricordare da sempre le gesta di Odysseo, ma in questo romanzo, attingendo all'immensa messe di miti che lo vedono protagonista, Valerio Massimo Manfredi porta alla luce episodi e personaggi che non conoscevamo, ci regala la viva emozione di scoprire un intero universo brulicante di uomini, donne, imprese gloriose o sventurate. Ci mostra come accanto a quel personaggio fluisca gran parte dell'epos greco: Alcesti, le fatiche di Herakles, i sette contro Tebe, gli Argonauti, oltre ai due poemi di Omero. Odysseo non si erge solitario tra le ombre di dei e guerrieri, ma il suo intero percorso di formazione, le sue radici familiari, gli epici racconti di cui è nutrito dal nonno- lupo Autolykos e dal padre argonauta, i dialoghi con Herakles e Áias, gli incontri con la misteriosa Athena dagli occhi verdi, ogni dettaglio dà corpo a un racconto profondamente sorprendente.Con assoluto rigore ma anche con una vibrante adesione a questa materia ""in continuo movimento"", Manfredi compie la scelta forte di affidare la narrazione proprio a colui che disse di chiamarsi Nessuno: una voce diretta, potente, scolpita nella sua semplicità.Una voce dal fascino assoluto, una storia incalzante come i tamburi di guerra, tempestosa come il mare scatenato da Poseidone, piena di poesia come il canto delle Sirene.",Il mio nome è Nessuno #1,Omnibus,,November 6th 2012,[],Hardcover,,9788804622871,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352288560l/16134609.jpg,4.06,[],83.0,1.0,,,,95.0,1668.0,360,Mondadori,"['588', '694', '303', '64', '19']",,[],,['Valerio Massimo Manfredi']

No enemy has ever made it across the Long Bridge or penetrated the city’s mighty walls. Even when a powerful invading army shows up at the gates, the duke and his daughter, Rina Veraiin, are certain that it poses little threat.But they are cruelly betrayed from within and, in a horrific spasm of violence, the city is brought to its knees.With the help of her bodyguard, Kork, the battle-trained young Rina narrowly escapes the slaughter and makes her way to the lair of an ancient sorcerer—the Ink Mage—who gifts her with a strange, beautiful set of magical tattoos.Now a duchess in exile, Rina sets out on a quest to reclaim what is rightfully hers, aided by a motley assortment of followers who will help her in her cause—some for noble reasons and others for their own dark purposes.With the enemy’s agents nipping at her heels, Rina must learn to harness her new and startling magical powers if she is to assert her rightful place as ruler of Klaar.Episode ListAn additional episode will be delivered every two weeks until the book is complete.

I Will Bear Witness 1933-41 A Diary of the Nazi Years,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'Memoir', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'War', 'Germany', 'Biography Memoir', 'German Literature']","The publication of Victor Klemperer's secret diaries brings to light one of the most extraordinary documents of the Nazi period. ""In its cool, lucid style and power of observation,"" said The New York Times, ""it is the best  written, most evocative, most observant record of daily life in the Third Reich."" I Will Bear Witness is a work of literature as well as a revelation of the day-by-day horror of the Nazi years.                           A Dresden Jew, a veteran of World War I, a man of letters and historian of great sophistication, Klemperer recognized the danger of Hitler as early as 1933. His diaries, written in secrecy, provide a vivid account of everyday life in Hitler's Germany.                          What makes this book so remarkable, aside from its literary distinction, is Klemperer's preoccupation with the thoughts and actions of ordinary Germans: Berger the greengrocer, who was given Klemperer's house (""anti-Hitlerist, but of course pleased at the good exchange""), the fishmonger, the baker, the much-visited dentist. All offer their thoughts and theories on the progress of the war: Will England hold out? Who listens to Goebbels? How much longer will it last?                          This symphony of voices is ordered by the brilliant, grumbling Klemperer, struggling to complete his work on eighteenth-century France while documenting the ever- tightening Nazi grip. He loses first his professorship and then his car, his phone, his house, even his typewriter, and is forced to move into a Jews' House (the last step before the camps), put his cat to death (Jews may not own pets), and suffer countless other indignities.                           Despite the danger his diaries would pose if discovered, Klemperer sees it as his duty to record events. ""I continue to write,"" he notes in 1941 after a terrifying run-in with the police. ""This is my heroics. I want to bear witness, precise witness, until the very end.""   When a neighbor remarks that, in his isolation, Klemperer will not be able to cover the main events of the war, he writes: ""It's not the big things that are important, but the everyday life of  tyranny, which may be forgotten. A thousand mosquito bites are worse than a blow on the head. I observe, I note, the mosquito bites.""                          This book covers the years from 1933 to 1941.

It Is Not What It Is: THE REAL (s)PAIN OF EUROPE,,[],"REVISED, UPDATED and ADDED AUTHOR´S NOTE (March 2019)  The world needs to know what is happening in Spain. Visiting tourists are served beautiful beaches, sports and gastronomy numbing their senses. There are many things going on in this glorious nation that never make the headlines in their home countries. Important issues since they ultimately determine the state of Europe and its position in the world.  The EU, which has focused strongly on expansion, is fractionalizing. Politicians, who follow outdated economic indicators, fail to see what is really going on. They are clueless! Economic indicators and corruption are measured “post-action”. Therefore, they are merely consequences and not the causes of social-economic turmoil.  How can Europeans, speak of human rights issues in China, when thousands of women are forced to work in “alegal” prostitution in Spain? Many of whom are victims of human trafficking. Not to speak of the 100,000 African immigrants who work and live under slave-like conditions in Almeria.  Close to 30% of Spanish citizens lives on the verge of poverty. A number, which will not improve shortly. The EU keeps on pouring money into the largest single beneficiary, but “Espanistan” keeps on wasting it. It has the richest politicians and former politicians in Europe. Many Spanish citizens have lost hope.  The country is run by an invisible force that goes by many names (e.g. la casta). This force places itself above the law and overturns Supreme Court rulings, replaces critical judges in important cases, silences and bribes witnesses and exercises the outdated ""gag-law"". A law that clearly contradicts freedom of speech.  Unfortunately, the corrupt practices of politicians rub off on corporate structures and society and the country has proven – time and time again – it cannot run its EU-course without intervention. It Is Not What It Is reveals 7 characteristics that function as a handbrake on Spain's development and shows the devastating effects of a conformist's attitude when applied on a national level.   *** ""The way you look at Spain will never be the same again."" - Brian Larsen, CEO Bancore   *** ""Let's imagine (…) this Dutch immigrant is right and his criticisms are for our own good... If this was not a written article, an image of a ""SPLASH!"" would be next. A slap in the face to wake us up from our false national dream."" - José Luis Roig, Spanish political analist (La Información)   *** ¨After analizing the 7 characterisctics on our show, we conclude that we agree with them¨ - P. Perez Salazar, journalist/RADIO host (Entre tu y yo... Lo que tu quieras), Madrid   *** ¨People who criticize you the most should know better! Great job.¨ - J. Encinas, Former Country Director USA (Codorniu)  ***  ¨I guess you will have a lot of critics coming from Spain, but you are just telling the truth.¨ - M.

The voice whispers, shouts, and sings to us that this experience of being in form, in space and time, knowing life and death, has meaning. The voice is that of inspiration, which is within each and every one of us.     In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains how we’ve chosen to enter this world of particles and form. From our place of origin, in ways that we don’t readily comprehend now, we knew what we were coming here to accomplish, and we participated in setting this life process in motion. So why not think this same way? Why put the responsibility or blame on any one or any thing that’s not a part of us? On Earth we have the capacity of volition—we can choose—so let’s assume that we had the same capacity when we resided in the spiritual realm. We chose our physical body, and we chose the parents we needed for the trip. It doesn’t seem too great a stretch to move into the idea that we chose this life in concert with our Source.     Each chapter in this book is filled with specifics for living an inspired life.

I'm Will,,[],"In his parents’ minds, Will was an underachiever. So they decided he should go to an expensive private high school that they couldn’t really afford. They assumed smaller classes and an ostentatious campus would help him overcome his enduring indifference to growing up. Will watched as his father wrote some great essays for his applications. Still he only got into a single school of the nine to which he applied--off the wait list when another family couldn’t afford the tuition.When Will arrived for his freshman year (or Class IV as the school called it), he quickly recognized he would rather be just about anywhere else. Over the next four years, he grew a foot, developed a dusting of facial hair, and mostly completed over six hundred nights of homework assignments. Among other things, he also was regularly grounded by his parents for uninspiring grades, was caught cheating, was introduced to alcohol, and had his heart tortured by a lesbian schoolmate with whom he was hopelessly in love.His final summer of high school is spent living in a monastery in Connecticut and working in Manhattan. His parents thought living with priests would help him develop more discipline and a healthier set of values. Instead, each evening he rode the commuter train home in the bar car with a group of adults he serendipitously met and provided him with a different kind of education than his parents’ had intended. Will’s life may have lacked purpose, but their standards were well below his own—and yet they were all successful in the ways that his school and his parents measured success.As punishment for some of his high school misadventures, Will had to write a thesis about someone he found interesting. He decided to write about himself. The result is I’m Will which shares an introspective glimpse into his struggle to find himself in the confusing and contradictory world of growing up.
