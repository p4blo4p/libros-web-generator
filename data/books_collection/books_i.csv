I.T. Lucas (Goodreads Author),Dark Stranger: The Dream,,English,,"Smart and Spicy, The Children of The Gods Paranormal Romance Series will keep you at the edge of your seat!A fascinating blend of Mythology, Cyber-war, and a tender Shades of Grey Romance, Dark Stranger – The Dream captivates the hearts and minds of readers around the world.Since the dawn of human civilization, two warring factions of near-immortals – the descendants of the gods of old – have been secretly shaping its destiny. Kian's small clan championing progress, freedom and peace; their powerful enemy propagating ignorance, hate, and war.Leading the clandestine battle from his luxurious L.A. high-rise, Kian is surrounded by family, yet he feels alone. Descending from a single goddess – the only one to survive the ancient cataclysm that wiped out the gods and most of their immortal offspring – clan members are forbidden to each other. And as the only other known immortals are their hated enemies, Kian and his kin have been long resigned to a lonely existence of fleeting trysts with human partners. That is, until Kian's sister Amanda – a researcher of paranormal abilities – makes a game changing discovery; a mortal seeress who she believes is a dormant carrier of their genes. Ever the realist, Kian is skeptical and refuses his sister's plea to attempt the Dormant's activation. But when his enemies learn of the highly coveted soothsayer's existence and attempt to grab her, he rushes her to the safety of his keep. Inexorably drawn to Syssi's shy beauty, Kian is startled by feelings he had sworn off long ago. Tormented by past mistakes, he wrestles with his conscience as he is tempted to explore her budding interest in the spicy passions he favors.When Syssi's paranormal foresight lands her a job at Dr. Amanda Dokani's neuroscience lab, it fails to predict, not only that her boss is an immortal who would drag her into a secret, millennia-old battle over humanity's future, but the professor's imposing brother who would alter her own. Despite his better judgement, will Kian succumb to Syssi's irresistible pull? And will Syssi discover that the man igniting her startlingly dark desires is a nearly two-thousand-year-old immortal?Warning. This book contains hot scenes and adult themes.

Once the Elder races ruled all the northern lands and their knowledge and power were legend. What calamity befell them, none now know. Centuries on and the north is a land where fell beasts and evil creatures roam unchecked, save in one place, the Wildlands of Darylor. Here mankind has slowly begun to explore and settle where once the Elder ruled, and within those lands, built amidst the ruins of a lost Elder city, lies the College of Magic. Inside, mankind seeks to rediscover the lost magics of old, but in secret one man desires the power to rule all and will stop at nothing to achieve his dream. Meanwhile, in the city of Shandrilos, in the shadow of the College of Magic, a groups of friends come together. Jon 'Bear' Madraig, fighter and mage, and his best friend the roguish swordsman and knight, Darin of Kenarth come to meet old friends and relive past adventures. The master mage, Arkadi Talcost and the beautiful druid, Rebba Korran, seek only to relax and enjoy some time away from the demands of their work and the College. For these friends, this is merely a reunion. However, for Zara Halven, the notorious Whore of Ostia, and for the monk, Garon Vale, the visit to Shandrilos is more; for one it is a chance for redemption and for the other it is a test of faith. Yet for the last of the friends, the visit to Shandrilos is the most important of all. For the huntress, Nat Bero it is a chance for forgiveness... and for revenge. These friends will be caught up in events that will change their lives forever, for the secret behind the destruction of the Elder is about to come to light... ""The fate of all can be decided by the actions of one who the gods guide to the right place at the right time. Do not underestimate the power of even the lowest to affect the paths of the mighty..."" The words of the seeress, Ry'Ina White Eyes If you are a reader of epic fantasy this is what you are looking for. If you liked Terry Brook's Shanara novels, Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia books, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings then this is a book for you.

Desperate to avert defeat, the Idirans had induced not one but two suns to explode, snuffing out worlds & biospheres teeming with sentient life. They were attacks of incredible proportion - gigadeathcrimes. But the war ended and life went on. Now, 800 years later, light from the 1st explosion is about to reach the Masaq' Orbital, home to the Culture's most adventurous & decadent souls. There it will fall upon Masaq's 50 billion inhabitants, gathered to commemorate the deaths of the innocent & to reflect, if only for a moment, on what some call the Culture's own complicity in the terrible event.Also journeying to Masaq' is Major Quilan, an emissary from the war-ravaged world of Chel. In the aftermath of the conflict that split his world apart, most believe he has come to Masaq' to bring home Chel's most brilliant star & self-exiled dissident, the honored Composer Ziller. Ziller claims he will do anything to avoid a meeting with Quilan, who he suspects has come to murder him. But the Major's true assignment will have far greater consequences than the death of a mere political dissident, as part of a conspiracy more ambitious than even he can know--a mission his superiors have buried so deeply in his mind that even he can't remember it.

Iain McGilchrist,The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World,,English,,"Why is the brain divided? The difference between right & left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries. In a book of unprecedented scope, McGilchrist draws on a vast body of recent brain research, illustrated with case histories, to reveal that the difference is profound—not just this or that function, but two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world. The left hemisphere is detail oriented, prefers mechanisms to living things & is inclined to self-interest. The right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility & generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music & language, & casts new light on the history of philosophy, as well as on some mental illnesses. The 2nd part of the book takes a journey thru the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought & belief of thinkers & artists, from Aeschylus to Magritte. He argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in the modern world, with potentially disastrous consequences.List of IllustrationsAcknowledgmentsIntroductionAsymmetry and the brain --What do the two hemispheres 'do'? --Language, truth and music --The nature of the two worlds --The primacy of the right hemisphere --The triumph of the left hemisphere --Imitation and the evolution of culture --The ancient world --The Renaissance and the Reformation --The Enlightenment --Romanticism and the Industrial Revolution --The modern and post-modern worldsConclusionNotes BibliographyIndex",,,10/30/09,December 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Psychology', 'Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Neuroscience', 'Brain', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Sociology']",,9780300148787,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328826802l/6968772.jpg,4.3,['Best Book of Ideas Prize Nominee (2010)'],97.0,1.0,,6968772-the-master-and-his-emissary,,,,,93.0,1502.0,608,,Yale University Press,"['846', '395', '163', '62', '36']",,,[],,

Oxford is the intellectual seat of the country, a place of great scientific, religious, and political ferment. A fellow of New College is found dead in suspicious circumstances. A young woman is accused of his murder.

"Ian Baker, Dalai Lama XIV (Introduction)",The Heart of the World: A Journey to the Last Secret Place,,English,,"The myth of Shangri-la originates in Tibetan Buddhist beliefs in beyul, or hidden lands, sacred sanctuaries that reveal themselves to devout pilgrims and in times of crisis. The more remote and inaccessible the beyul, the vaster its reputed qualities. Ancient Tibetan prophecies declare that the greatest of all hidden lands lies at the heart of the forbidding Tsangpo Gorge, deep in the Himalayas and veiled by a colossal waterfall. Nineteenth-century accounts of this fabled waterfall inspired a series of ill-fated European expeditions that ended prematurely in 1925 when the intrepid British plant collector Frank Kingdon-Ward penetrated all but a five-mile section of the Tsangpo's innermost gorge and declared that the falls were no more than a ""religious myth"" and a ""romance of geography."" The heart of the Tsangpo Gorge remained a blank spot on the map of world exploration until world-class climber and Buddhist scholar Ian Baker delved into the legends. Whatever cryptic Tibetan scrolls or past explorers had said about the Tsangpo's innermost gorge, Baker determined, could be verified only by exploring the uncharted five-mile gap. After several years of encountering sheer cliffs, maelstroms of impassable white water, and dense leech-infested jungles, on the last of a series of extraordinary expeditions, Baker and his National Geographic-sponsored team reached the depths of the Tsangpo Gorge. They made news worldwide by finding there a 108-foot-high waterfall, the legendary grail of Western explorers and Tibetan seekers alike.  ""The Heart of the World"" is one of the most captivating stories of exploration and discovery in recent memory-an extraordinary journey to one of the wildest and most inaccessible places on earth and a pilgrimage to the heart of the Tibetan Buddhist faith.",,,10/30/00,November 4th 2004,[],Hardcover,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'Buddhism', 'History', 'Asia', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Memoir']",,9781594200274,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309210792l/406987.jpg,4.06,[],100.0,1.0,,406987.The_Heart_of_the_World,,,,,94.0,665.0,511,,Penguin Press,"['269', '221', '133', '28', '14']",,,[],,

Ian C. Esslemont,Orb Sceptre Throne,,English,,"The epic new chapter in the history of Malaz -- the new epic fantasy from Steven Erikson's friend and co-creator of this extraordinary and exciting imagined world. Darujhistan, city of dreams, city of blue flames, is peaceful at last; its citizens free to return to politicking, bickering, trading and, above all, enjoying the good things in life. Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity. While, as ever at the centre of everything, a thief in a red waistcoat and of rotund proportions walks the streets, juggling in one hand custard pastries, and in the other the fate of the city itself. Far to the south, fragments of the titanic Moon's Spawn have crashed into the Rivan Sea creating a series of isles... and a fortune hunter's dream. A Malazan veteran calling himself 'Red' ventures out to try his luck -- and perhaps say goodbye to old friends. But there he finds far more than he'd bargained for as the rush to claim the Spawn's treasures descends into a mad scramble of chaos and bloodshed. For powers from across the world have gathered here, searching for the legendary Throne of Night. The impact of these events are far reaching, it seems. On an unremarkable island off the coast of Genabackis, a people who had turned their backs upon all such strivings now lift their masked faces towards the mainland and recall the ancient prophesy of a return. And what about the ex-Claw of the Malazan Empire who now walks the uttermost edge of creation?

"Ian Caldwell, Dustin Thomason (Goodreads Author)",The Rule of Four,,English,,"An ivy league murder, a mysterious coded manuscript, and the secrets of a Renaissance prince collide memorably in The Rule of Four -- a brilliant work of fiction that weaves together suspense and scholarship, high art and unimaginable treachery.It's Easter at Princeton. Seniors are scrambling to finish their theses. And two students, Tom Sullivan and Paul Harris, are a hair's breadth from solving the mysteries of the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili--a renowned text attributed to an Italian nobleman, a work that has baffled scholars since its publication in 1499. For Tom, their research has been a link to his family's past -- and an obstacle to the woman he loves. For Paul, it has become an obsession, the very reason for living. But as their deadline looms, research has stalled -- until a long-lost diary surfaces with a vital clue. And when a fellow researcher is murdered just hours later, Tom and Paul realize that they are not the first to glimpse the Hypnerotomachia 's secrets.Suddenly the stakes are raised, and as the two friends sift through the codes and riddles at the heart of the text, they are beginnning to see the manuscript in a new light--not simply as a story of faith, eroticism and pedantry, but as a bizarre, coded mathematical maze. And as they come closer and closer to deciphering the final puzzle of a book that has shattered careers, friendships and families, they know that their own lives are in mortal danger. Because at least one person has been killed for knowing too much. And they know even more.From the streets of fifteenth-century Rome to the rarified realm of Princeton, from a shocking 500 year-old murder scene to the drama of a young man's coming of age, The Rule of Four takes us on an entertaining, illuminating tour of history--as it builds to a pinnacle of nearly unbearable suspense.",,,10/28/04,June 28th 2005,"['Thomas More', 'Moses (Bible)', 'Flavius Josephus', 'Zeus (God)', 'Michelangelo', 'Saint Jerome', 'Leda (mythology)', 'Girolamo Savonarola', 'Leon Battista Alberti', 'Priapus', 'Francesco Colonna', 'Vincent Taft', 'Richard Curry', 'Thomas Corelli Sullivan', 'Bill Stein', 'Poliphilo', 'Polia', 'Patrick Sullivan (Rule of Four)', 'Joseph (Son of Jacob)', 'Paul Harris', 'Gil (Preston Gilmore Rankin)', 'Procrustes (mythology)', 'Vitruvius', 'Charlie Freeman', 'Katie Marchand']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Books About Books', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Historical']",,9780440241355,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389185899l/18431.jpg,3.27,[],283.0,3.0,,18431.The_Rule_of_Four,,,,,77.0,34632.0,450,,Dell Publishing Company,"['4941', '9673', '12198', '5570', '2250']",,,"['Princeton, New Jersey (United States)', 'Columbus, Ohio (United States)', 'Austin, Texas (United States)', 'Genoa (Italy)', 'Rome (Italy)', 'Florence (Italy)']",,

Ian Frazier,On the Rez,,English,,"On the Rez is a sharp, unflinching account of the modern-day American Indian experience, especially that of the Oglala Sioux, who now live on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the plains and badlands of the American West. Crazy Horse, perhaps the greatest Indian war leader of the 1800s, and Black Elk, the holy man whose teachings achieved worldwide renown, were Oglala; in these typically perceptive pages, Frazier seeks out their descendants on Pine Ridge—a/k/a ""the rez""—which is one of the poorest places in America today. Along with his longtime friend Le War Lance (whom he first wrote about in his 1989 bestseller, Great Plains) and other Oglala companions, Frazier fully explores the rez as they visit friends and relatives, go to pow-wows and rodeos and package stores, and tinker with a variety of falling-apart cars. He takes us inside the world of the Sioux as few writers ever have, writing with much wit, compassion, and imagination. In the career of SuAnne Big Crow, for example, the most admired Oglala basketball player of all time, who died in a car accident in 1992, Frazier finds a contemporary reemergence of the death-defying, public-spirited Sioux hero who fights with grace and glory to save her followers.

Ian Kershaw,Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris,,English,,"From his illegitimate birth in a small Austrian village to his fiery death in a bunker under the Reich chancellery in Berlin, Adolf Hitler left a murky trail, strewn with contradictory tales & overgrown with self-created myths. One truth prevails: the sheer scale of the evils that he unleashed on the world has made him a demonic figure without equal in this century. Kershaw's Hitler brings us closer than ever before to the character of the bizarre misfit in his 30-year ascent from a Viennese shelter for the indigent to uncontested rule over the German nation that had tried & rejected democracy in the crippling aftermath of WWI. With extraordinary vividness, Kershaw recreates the settings that made Hitler's rise possible: the virulent anti-Semitism of prewar Vienna, the crucible of a war with immense casualties, the toxic nationalism that gripped Bavaria in the 20s, the undermining of the Weimar Republic by extremists of the Right & the Left, the hysteria that accompanied Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 & then mounted in brutal attacks by his storm troopers on Jews & others condemned as enemies of the Aryan race. In an account drawing on many previously untapped sources, Hitler metamorphoses from an obscure fantasist, a drummer sounding an insistent beat of hatred in Munich beer halls, to the instigator of an infamous failed putsch &, ultimately, to the leadership of a ragtag alliance of right-wing parties fused into a movement that enthralled the German people. This volume, 1st of two, ends with the promulgation of the infamous Nuremberg laws that pushed German Jews to the outer fringes of society, & with the march of the German army into the Rhineland, Hitler's initial move toward the abyss of war.",Hitler #1,,10/30/98,April 12th 2000,['Adolf Hitler'],Paperback,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Germany', 'War', 'European History', 'Politics', 'Holocaust', 'World History']",,9780393320350,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389660286l/93996.jpg,4.21,['Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (1999)'],101.0,2.0,,93996.Hitler,,,,,93.0,5049.0,912,,W.W.

Ian McEwan,Enduring Love,,English,,"Joe planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside to celebrate his lover's return after 6 weeks in the States. The perfect day turns to nightmare however, when they are involved in freak ballooning accident in which a boy is saved but a man is killed. In itself, the accident would change the couple and the survivors' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that same night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, ""I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable."") Worst of all, Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa.  Apart from the incessant stalking, it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe, a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in de-familiarisation. But Enduring Love and its underrated predecessor, Black Dogs, are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel's end, you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons, but you won't be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye. --Alex Freeman",,,09/28/97,October 28th 2004,"['Joe Rose', 'Clarissa Mellon', 'Jed Parry', 'Jean Logan']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780099481249,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1313656531l/6870.jpg,3.64,"['James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (1997)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (1999)']",351.0,5.0,,6870.Enduring_Love,,,,,88.0,37763.0,245,,Vintage,"['7489', '14795', '10917', '3366', '1196']",,,"['London, England', 'England']",,
Ian McEwan,On Chesil Beach,,English,,"A novel of remarkable depth and poignancy from one of the most acclaimed writers of our time.It is July 1962. Florence is a talented musician who dreams of a career on the concert stage and of the perfect life she will create with Edward, an earnest young history student at University College of London, who unexpectedly wooed and won her heart. Newly married that morning, both virgins, Edward and Florence arrive at a hotel on the Dorset coast. At dinner in their rooms they struggle to suppress their worries about the wedding night to come. Edward, eager for rapture, frets over Florence’s response to his advances and nurses a private fear of failure, while Florence’s anxieties run deeper: she is overcome by sheer disgust at the idea of physical contact, but dreads disappointing her husband when they finally lie down together in the honeymoon suite. Ian McEwan has caught with understanding and compassion the innocence of Edward and Florence at a time when marriage was presumed to be the outward sign of maturity and independence.

She is fiercely intelligent, well respected, and deeply immersed in the nuances of her particular field of law. Often the outcome of a case seems simple from the outside, the course of action to ensure a child's welfare obvious. But the law requires more rigor than mere pragmatism, and Fiona is an expert in considering the sensitivities of culture and religion when handing down her verdicts. But Fiona's professional success belies domestic strife. Her husband, Jack, asks her to consider an open marriage and, after an argument, moves out of their house. His departure leaves her adrift, wondering whether it was not love she had lost so much as a modern form of respectability; whether it was not contempt and ostracism she really fears. She decides to throw herself into her work, especially a complex case involving a seventeen-year-old boy whose parents will not permit a lifesaving blood transfusion because it conflicts with their beliefs as Jehovah's Witnesses.

The protagonist, Leonard Marnham, is a 25-year-old, naive, unsophisticated English post office technician who is astonished and alarmed to find himself involved in a top-secret operation. At the same time that he loses his political innocence, Leonard experiences his sexual initiation in a clandestine affair with a German divorcee five years his senior. As his two secret worlds come together, events develop into a gruesome nightmare, building to a searing, unforgettable scene of surrealist intensity in which Leonard and his lover try to conceal evidence of a murder. Acting to save himself from a prison sentence, Leonard desperately performs an act of espionage whose ironic consequences resonate down the years to a twister of an ending. Though its plot rivals any thriller in narrative tension, this novel is also a character study--of a young man coming of age in bizarre circumstances, and of differences in national character: the gentlemanly Brits, all decorum and civility; the brash, impatient Americans; the cynical Germans.

Ian Mortimer (Goodreads Author),"The Perfect King: The Life of Edward III, Father of the English Nation",,English,,"He ordered his uncle to be beheaded; he usurped his father's throne; he taxed his people more than any other previous king, and he started a war which lasted for more than a hundred years. Yet for centuries Edward III (1327-77) was celebrated as the most brilliant of all English monarchs. In this first full study of his character and life, Ian Mortimer shows how under Edward the feudal kingdom of England became a highly organised nation, capable of raising large revenues and deploying a new type of projectile-based warfare, culminating in the crushing victory over the French at Crecy. Yet under his rule England also experienced its longest period of domestic peace in the middle ages, giving rise to a massive increase of the nation's wealth through the wool trade, with huge consequences for society, art and architecture. It is to Edward that England owes its system of parliamentary representation, its local justice system, its national flag and the recognition of English as the language of the nation. Nineteenth century historians saw in Edward the opportunity to decry a warmonger, and painted him as a self-seeking, rapacious, tax-gathering conqueror. Yet as this book shows, beneath the strong warrior king was a compassionate, conscientious and often merciful man - resolute yet devoted to his wife, friends and family. He emerges as a strikingly modern figure, to whom many will be able to relate - the father of both the English people and the English nation.",,,03/28/06,April 5th 2007,"['Isabella of France', 'Edward III of England', 'John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster', 'Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March']",Paperback,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Medieval', 'British Literature', 'Medieval History', 'Historical', '14th Century', 'Biography Memoir', 'European History']",,9781844135301,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320388621l/840610.jpg,4.17,[],181.0,3.0,,840610.The_Perfect_King,,,,,96.0,1770.0,560,,Pimlico,"['714', '732', '256', '49', '19']",,,[],,

Ian Sample,Massive: The Higgs Boson and the Greatest Hunt in Science: Updated Edition,,English,,"In the early 1960s, three groups of physicists, working independently in different countries, stumbled upon an idea that would change physics and fuel the imagination of scientists for decades. That idea was the Higgs boson – to find it would be to finally understand the origins of mass – the last building block of life itself. Now, almost 50 years later, that particle has finally been discovered.Award-winning science writer Ian Sample weaves together the personal stories and intense rivalries of the teams of scientists behind the Higgs boson. Massive is a tale of grand ambition, trans-Atlantic competition, clashing egos and occasionally spectacular failures. From the giant particle colliders built to further the scientists' quest to the political fallout of budget blowouts, debates over whether the search might even destroy the universe, to the incredible discovery of the particle itself, this is an epic story of imagination, personal ambition, sub-atomic exploration and global significance.Whichever way you look at it, this story is massive.",,,11/06/10,January 17th 2013,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Popular Science', 'History', 'Biography', 'Nature', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'History Of Science', '21st Century']",,9780753541531,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353033167l/16127265.jpg,3.88,[],92.0,1.0,,16127265-massive,,,,,93.0,718.0,352,,Virgin Books,"['217', '258', '196', '37', '10']",,,[],,

Ian W. Toll (Goodreads Author),Six Frigates: The Epic History of the Founding of the U. S. Navy,,English,,"How ""a handful of bastards and outlaws fighting under a piece of striped bunting"" humbled the omnipotent British Navy.Before the ink was dry on the U.S. Constitution, the establishment of a permanent military had become the most divisive issue facing the new government. Would a standing army be the thin end of dictatorship? Would a navy protect American commerce against the Mediterranean pirates, or drain the treasury and provoke hostilities with the great powers? The foundersparticularly Jefferson, Madison, and Adamsdebated these questions fiercely and switched sides more than once. How much of a navy would suffice? Britain alone had hundreds of powerful warships.From the decision to build six heavy frigates, through the cliffhanger campaign against Tripoli, to the war that shook the world in 1812, Ian W. Toll tells this grand tale with the political insight of Founding Brothers and a narrative flair worthy of Patrick O'Brian.

Ian W. Toll (Goodreads Author),"Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941–1942",,English,,"
  The planning, the strategy, the sacrifices and heroics-on both sides-illuminating the greatest naval war in history.
On the first Sunday in December 1941, an armada of Japanese warplanes appeared suddenly over Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and devastated the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Six months later, in a sea fight north of the tiny atoll of Midway, four Japanese aircraft carriers were sent into the abyss. Pacific Crucible tells the epic tale of these first searing months of the Pacific war, when the U.S. Navy shook off the worst defeat in American military history and seized the strategic initiative.Ian W. Toll's dramatic narrative encompasses both the high command and the ""sailor's-eye"" view from the lower deck. Relying predominantly on eyewitness accounts and primary sources, Pacific Crucible also spotlights recent scholarship that has revised our understanding of the conflict, including the Japanese decision to provoke a war that few in the country's highest circles thought they could win. The result is a page-turning history that does justice to the breadth and depth of a tremendous subject.",The Pacific War Trilogy #1,,,November 14th 2011,"['Douglas MacArthur', 'Hirohito', 'George C.

Ian W. Toll (Goodreads Author),"The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944",,English,,"The devastation of Pearl Harbor and the American victory at Midway were prelude to a greater challenge: rolling back the vast Japanese Pacific empire, island by island.This masterful history encompasses the heart of the Pacific War—the period between mid-1942 and mid-1944—when parallel Allied counteroffensives north and south of the equator washed over Japan's far-flung island empire like a ""conquering tide,"" concluding with Japan's irreversible strategic defeat in the Marianas. It was the largest, bloodiest, most costly, most technically innovative and logistically complicated amphibious war in history, and it fostered bitter interservice rivalries, leaving wounds that even victory could not heal.Often overlooked, these are the years and fights that decided the Pacific War. Ian W. Toll's battle scenes—in the air, at sea, and in the jungles—are simply riveting. He also takes the reader into the wartime councils in Washington and Tokyo where politics and strategy often collided, and into the struggle to mobilize wartime production, which was the secret of Allied victory. Brilliantly researched, the narrative is propelled and colored by firsthand accounts—letters, diaries, debriefings, and memoirs—that are the raw material of the telling details, shrewd judgment, and penetrating insight of this magisterial history.",The Pacific War Trilogy #2,,,September 21st 2015,"['Douglas MacArthur', 'George C.

Ibn Kathir,Stories Of The Prophets [peace be upon them],,English,,"قصص الأنبياء في القرآن الكريم هي قصص لصفوة الخلق وخيرتهم على الإطلاق، فهم هداة العالمين ورحمة الله للناس أجمعين، وما كان الله قص ما قص من قصص في قرآن الكريم للتسلية والتلهي، وإنما جاء عظة وعبرة لأولي الألباب، وجاء يثير في النفس التأمل والتفكر في سنن الحياة وقواعد الاجتماع البشري وسيرة الناس عبر الزمان والمكان. وإن كان ربنا، تبارك وتعالى، أنعم علينا بنعمة قصص طائفة من حكايات الأنبياء وأقوامهم فإنه يلفت النظر إلى أن المهم في تاريخ هؤلاء العظماء أ نقف عند حد العظة والعبرة. ولقد تمثل المفسر الحافظ ابن كثير منهجاً علمياً بديعاً في عرض هذا القصص القرآني، حاول فيه الابتعاد عن خرافات الإسرائيليات وخزعبلات القصاص وأكاذيب بعض المؤرخين.ويمكن تحديد معالم هذا المنهج على النحو التالي: أولاً التزامه بإيراد كل ما يتعلق بالنبي صاحب القصة من كتاب الله تعالى، وأخبار القرآن في هذا السياق هي الأخبار المجزوم يصدقها على وجه اليقين من دون تردد. ولم يكتف المؤلف بذلك بل وقف مع الآيات محللاً لها، مفسراً لمعانيها، متعمقاً في مغازيها، وهو المفسر الواعي بدقائق التفسير.ثانياً عنايته عناية كبيرة بالأخبار والآثار المروية بشأن هؤلاء الأنبياء على عدة مستويات، فالأحاديث يعنى بعزوها إلى مصادرها، منبهاً على صحيحها وسقيمها في كثير من الأحيان، والإسرائيليات إذا وردت في النص، فإنه يرويها في حذر المحدث الواعي بالمرويات، مبيناً الغث منها وما يمكن أن يكون في إطار المقبول، والآثار يتتبع ما يلقي على النص شيئاً من الضوء لإيضاح غامض أو توضيح مبهم. ثالثاً العناية باللغة إلى حد معقول فيفسر ما نبا من مفردات، ويشرح ما ثقل فهمه من نصوص، وهو يحمل في ذهنه عقلية لغوية بليغة. رابعاً بالإضافة إلى ذلك كله التسلسل المنهجي المنطلق مع الأحداث، مع شيء من الاستطراد المقبول بهدف استخراج العظة والوقوف مع فائدة هنا، أو شاردة هناك.وكتاب قصص الأنبياء الذي هو بين يدي القارئ هو جزء من كتاب ابن كثير ""البداية والنهاية""، انتزعه كل طبع الكتاب مستقلاً منه، فليس هو مصنفاً مستقلاً في أصل تأليف ووضعه. ولأهميته تمّ الاعتناء به على هذا النحو: أولاً: العناية بإخراج النص إخراجاً صحيحاً بعيداً عن الأخطاء ما أمكن ذلك، ثانياً: تخريج الآيات القرآنية، مع استعراض غريب المفردات التي توجد في الآيات، ثالثاً: تخريج المرويات المتعددة، رابعاً: شرح المفردات الغريبة في النص كله تيسيراً للفهم وتحقيقاً لهدف تبسيط النص، خامساً: وضع عناوين جانبية لكل فكرة جديدة، ليسهل على القارئ متابعة تسلسل الأحداث والاستفادة بما في الكتاب من فوائد علمية متنوعة.",البداية والنهاية,,10/30/81,Best Books,[],,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Inspirational', 'Biography', 'Reference', 'Short Stories', 'Unfinished', 'Biography Memoir']",,9781591440390,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312441804l/555136.jpg,4.49,[],96.0,1.0,,555136.Stories_Of_The_Prophets_peace_be_upon_them_,,,,,96.0,5441.0,,,"Islamic Studies Scholars

Ida Lichter,Muslim Women Reformers: Inspiring Voices Against Oppression,,English,,"In a world where the strident demands of Islamic extremists capture the media’s attention, the courageous protests of Muslim reformers barely receive any notice. These include a surprising number of women who are prepared to challenge institutionalized persecution, risking derision, arrest, physical harm, and even death.In this inspiring compilation of Muslim women’s stories from around the world, the voices of these long-oppressed women ring loud and clear as they question ideology and culture, patriarchal and religious beliefs, and demand the social and political rights women lack in many Muslim countries. The reformers speak out with passion, humanity, and sometimes humor in these compact and often poignant biographies, bringing alive the harsh realities for women in many parts of the world. By surveying a wide range of Muslim reformers, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and North America, author Ida Lichter uncovers some significant emerging trends. For example, she notes that the majority of Muslim feminists would like to see reform contained within Islam. Many criticize their patriarchal culture for suppressing egalitarian views that they believe the Koran expresses and so they advocate a reinterpretation of the holy text. Some demand changes to discriminatory Sharia-based laws. Others campaign openly for political and educational reforms.Complete with a glossary and a list of helpful Web sites, this vibrant anthology makes use of reliable translations from original languages to demonstrate the groundswell of grassroots change that promises eventually to bring even the most conservative sectors of Islam into the twenty-first century.",,,,May 26th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Islam', 'Womens', 'Social Justice', 'Gender']",,9781591027164,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463652l/6517322.jpg,3.81,[],95.0,1.0,,6517322-muslim-women-reformers,,,,,84.0,32.0,513,,Prometheus Books,"['12', '8', '7', '4', '1']",,,[],,

Idries Shah,The Book of the Book,,English,,"The classical Sufi masters often behaved in dramatic and unexpected ways in marketplaces, palaces, village streets, wherever people assembled. The purpose of these demonstrations was to create an event that people could think about and learn a lesson from. In 1969, Idries Shah, author of over thirty books on Sufi teaching and learning, used modern methods of mass communication to create a teaching-event for the modern world. ""The Book of the Book"", first published in that year and now in its seventh printing, transmits a 700-year-old narrative on the theme of ""do not mistake the container for the content"". But it projects this lesson in a highly unconventional way. Reactions to ""The Book of the Book"" ran the gamut. Some people were infuriated. One ""expert"" at the British Museum said it was ""not a book at all"". Others either thought the cover price was too high for a ""book that was not a book"", or simply bought it for novelty value and kept it on hand to mystify their friends. In time, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. Readers and reviewers now understand that unlike any other literary product ever published, ""The Book of the Book"" offers the opportunity to participate in a major Sufi teaching-event ... for the price of a book.

The ""gazelles"" are extraordinary experiences and perceptions latent in ordinary man. ""Veiling"" refers to the action of the subjective or ""commanding"" self, which partly through indoctrination and partly through base aspirations, prevents higher vision.

Skillful contemporary retellings of hundreds of collected stories and sayings bring the unmistakable--often backhanded--wisdom, wit and charm of the timeless jokester to life. The Mulla and his stories appear in literature and oral traditions from the Middle East to Greece, Russia, France--even China. Many nations claim Nasrudin as a native son, but nobody really knows who he was or where he came from. According to a legend dating from at least the 13th century, Nasrudin was snatched as a schoolboy from the clutches of the ""Old Villain""--the crude system of thought that ensnares man--to carry through the ages the message of how to escape. He was chosen because he could make people laugh, and humor has a way of slipping through the cracks of the most rigid thinking habits. Acclaimed as humorous masterpieces, as collections of the finest jokes, as priceless gift books, and for hundreds ""enchanted tales,"" this folklore figure's antics have also been divined as ""mirroring the antics of the mind."" The jokes are, as Idries Shah notes, ""perfectly designed models for isolating and holding distortions of the mind which so often pass for reasonable behavior."" Therefore they have a double use: when the jokes have been enjoyed, their psychological significance starts to sink in. In fact, for many centuries they have been studied in Sufi circles for their hidden wisdom. They are used as teaching exercises, in part to momentarily ""freeze"" situations in which states of mind can be recognized. The key to the philosophic significance of the Nasrudin jokes is given in Idries Shah's book The Sufis and a complete system of mystical training based upon them was described in the Hibbert Journal. In these delightful volumes, Shah not only gives the Mulla a proper vehicle for our times, he proves that the centuries-old stories and quips of Nasrudin are still some of the funniest jokes in the world.",Mulla Nasrudin,,11/29/68,July 1st 1993,['Goha'],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Spirituality', 'Humor', 'Islam', 'Comedy', 'Folk Tales', 'Short Stories', 'Literature']",,9780140193572,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348021570l/530425.jpg,4.36,[],228.0,3.0,,530425.The_Pleasantries_of_the_Incredible_Mulla_Nasrudin,,,,,97.0,486.0,224,,Penguin Books,"['275', '134', '62', '6', '9']",,,[],,
"Idries Shah, Louis Marin",Oriental Magic,,English,,"Does there lie in mankind's remote past a single origin for the beliefs and practices of magic found in nearly every culture in the world? Behind the distortions and grotesqueries of magical practices, could there be clues to processes worthy of our objective consideration? First published nearly forty years ago, ""Oriental Magic"" is still the definitive work on the subject. Its publication was the culmination of five years of research into rare artifacts, obscure manuscripts and travels into remote areas where strange magical practices endure. The ""Singing Sands"" of Egypt, the invisible rulership of Sufism, subcutaneous electricity, and the prehistoric sources of Babylonian occult practices are just a few of the intriguing subjects described. The author includes personal accounts of ""training"" under a Ju-Ju witch doctor, a demonstration of Hindu levitation, and translations of secret alchemical and magical formulae. Revealed is an astonishing similarity in magical beliefs, practices and terminology of places as diverse as China, the Near East, Scandinavia and Africa. ""Oriental Magic"" includes a myriad of illustrations, including unique photos of places and people associated with the mysterious world of magic.

"Idries Shah, Natasha Delmar (Illustrator)",The Old Woman and the Eagle,,English,,"It wasn't very long ago that few Americans even knew where Afghanistan was, much less had any interest in its culture or those of its Central Asian neighbors. While things have changed in that regard, there are still precious few children's books in our country having to do with that part of the world.This lack makes Hoopoe s award-winning series all the more compelling. These enchanting and beautifully illustrated books, which have delighted children, parents and educators since 1998, are based on traditional stories from Afghanistan, Central Asia and the Middle east, collected and written for children by Afghan author Idries Shah.The latest in this series, THE OLD WOMAN AND THE EAGLE will not disappoint. Superbly illustrated by Natasha Delmar, daughter of the celebrated classic Chinese painter Ng Yi-Ching, and intended for children ages 3-8, it tells with gentle humor what happens when an old woman encounters an eagle for the first time. Perplexed by its unfamiliar appearance, she decides to change it to suit her own ideas of what a bird should look like. Her efforts which much to the poor eagle s chagrin, include straightening its beak, trimming its claws and smoothing its feathers mirror a common pattern of human thought: altering the unfamiliar to make it acceptable.This book, like the previous seven in Hoopoe s series, does more than entertain. It encourages children to think for themselves and helps foster greater insight and mental flexibility in people of all ages. In the process, it also teaches us something about an important but little-known culture. Few Americans realize that, prior to the Soviet invasion and subsequent chaos in that country, Afghanistan was a major cultural crossroads, a place where many races lived alongside each other in harmony and where a rich, diverse culture developed over many centuries. THE OLD WOMAN AND THE EAGLE like its fellow Hoopoe titles provides a beautiful and positive representation of that culture when we need it most. The exquisite illustrations offer a taste of the dress, geography and art of the region. Children delight in the story as they have done for more than a thousand years. At this difficult time, this book can help children get a better understanding of a very important part of the world, what we have in common, and what we can learn from each other.About the AuthorIdries Shah, who died in 1996, spent over 30 years collecting stories from the Sufi tradition and adapting them to contemporary Western culture. His more than three dozen books have been translated into 12 languages. A practical philosophy with deep roots in Afghanistan, Sufism is sometimes mislabeled Islamic mysticism in the West because it is widespread in Moslem countries, although it is not tied to any religion and has included members of all faiths.Natasha Delmar was born in Hong Kong and raised in Argentina. Now she lives and works in the Bay Area. Natasha learned to paint from her father, the celebrated classic Chinese painter Ng Yi-Ching.

In Fontamara, Bread and Wine, and The Seed Beneath the Snow - presented together for the first time in English to mark the centenary of the author's birth - Silone narrates the struggles of the cafoni, the farmers and peasants of his native Abruzzo, against poverty, natural disasters, and totalitarianism. The first novel in the series, Fontamara, is a political fable that portrays the bitter trials of the villagers of Pescina as they battle with landowners who have appropriated their only source of water. First published from his exile in Zurich in 1933, and banned in his own country, the novel was translated into twenty languages and won Silone instant international literary fame. Silone's masterpiece, Bread and Wine, introduces the semi-autobiographical character Pietro Spina, an anti-Fascist revolutionary who returns to his homeland after fifteen years in exile. He seeks refuge among the Abruzzo peasants by posing as the priest Don Paolo Spada.  Pietro's story continues in The Seed Beneath the Snow, Silone's personal favorite in the trilogy.

"Ilija Trojanow, William Hobson (Translator)",The Collector of Worlds,,English,,"A stunning fictionalized account of the infamous life of British colonial officer and translator Sir Richard Francis BurtonThis fictionalized account imagines the life of Sir Richard Francis Burton--a nineteenth-century British colonial officer with a rare ability to assimilate into indigenous cultures. Burton's obsessive traveling took him from England to British India, Arabia, and on a quest for the source of the Nile River in Africa. He learned more than twenty lan-guages, translated ""The Arabian Nights"" and the Kama Sutra, and took part in the pilgrimage to Mecca, in addition to writing several travel books.This elegant, layered novel tells the story of Burton's adventures in British West India, his experience on the hajj to Mecca, and his exploration of East Africa. In each section, perspective shifts between Burton and the voices of those men he encounters along the way: his Indian servant tells the stories of his travails with Burton to a scribe; the qadi, the governor, and the shari in Mecca investigate Burton's hajj; and Sidi Mubarak Bombay, his African guide, shares his story with friends in Zanzibar.

Her inn defies laws of physics, her dog is secretly a monster, and the only permanent guest of the inn is a former Galactic tyrant with a price on her head. The inn needs guests to thrive and guests have been scarce, so when an Arbitrator shows up at Dina's door and asks her to host a peace summit between three warring species, she jumps on the chance. Unfortunately, for Dina, bridging the gap between space vampires, the Hope-Crushing Horde, and the merchants of Baha-char is much easier said than done.

Thing is, when Emma blinks, she might be doing the same and, before long, she's dropped into the very story she thought she'd written. Trapped in a weird, snow-choked valley, Emma meets other kids with dark secrets and strange abilities: Eric, Casey, Bode, Rima, and a very special little girl, Lizzie. What they discover is that they--and Emma--may be nothing more than characters written into being from an alternative universe for a very specific purpose.Now what they must uncover is why they've been brought to this place--a world between the lines where parallel realities are created and destroyed and nightmares are written--before someone pens their end.",Dark Passages #1,,,February 11th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Paranormal', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Supernatural', 'Magic']",,B00EMX82IS,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383505535l/13449631.jpg,3.26,[],70.0,1.0,,13449631-white-space,,,,,70.0,1465.0,560,,Egmont USA,"['315', '346', '370', '266', '168']",,,[],,

Ilvario (Goodreads Author),The Empireid,,,,"Fiction. Poetry. Vagabond is pleased to announce the launch of THE EMPIREID, by Ilvario, an epic journey in verse. In structured form of 17 line terza rima stanzas (A-B-A, B-C-B, C-D-C, D-E-D, E-F-E, F-F), THE EMPIREID continues the story of the Trojan line of Aeneas, from the founding of Rome to present day. Challenging war, empire and religion, THE EMPIREID (which translates to, ""The Story of the End of Empire"") follows the tale of Horacio, grandson of Venus, and last of the Trojan line, who on the eve of his thirteenth year, in 1453, the year that Constantinople fell, is sent on a quest to Hades, to free the gods of old from a trap set by Pluto, the God of the Underworld, to strip them of their powers, by placing them into an eternal sleep...that trap being monotheism. Following history, legend and myth, the story weaves a tapestry of Mediterranean warfare throughout the 1460's, during the rise of the Ottoman Empire, when much of the world was still unknown, where our hero is taken captive by a band of corsairs. Raised at sea as one of their own, aboard The Crescent Moon, captained by the pirate Reis-el-Khan, Horacio grows to become a seafaring warrior entangled in the expanding wars for conquest and regional power, all the while driven to fulfill his mission, until by fate and circumstance, being made captain, he is propelled between natural and unnatural forces - a blood feud, cat-and-mouse high seas chase on one end and the ethereal forces of other dimensions, pulling and leading him to his ultimate destination...Aethalia, The Island of Venus, from where through the Enfola, the navel connecting heaven, the underworld and earth, Horacio discovers a secret entrance to Hades, and with demons at his heels, and the assistance of a few divine gifts, Horacio must navigate the labyrinth and ever present dangers of the underworld, to find and smash the Infinity Glass, using the Sword of Troy, which he has carried with him all these years, only by which he might free Saturn, the ruler of time and father to all the gods immortal...but to do so he must pay a heavy price.

Ilyan Kei Lavanway (Goodreads Author),Earth Sink,,,,"Earth Sink is a challenging and insightful read that demands an attentive mind and some awareness of the sociopolitical trends going on in America and around the world. Secret societies, banking cartels, and terrorist regimes have been funding and grooming political candidates for the highest offices of American government. A one man sleeper cell has been in play since 2008. The American people blindly voted him into position. Or did they? In a day when it is becoming a crime to worship Jesus Christ, signs of the times and biblical prophecies are unfolding at ever increasing rates. The story starts way back in a time veiled from your mind, when you fought a war you don't remember, a war for your very right to be born. Events playing out on Earth are extensions of that war. The original foes know you better than you know yourself, and they cannot be killed. They were never alive. The story is a fictional dramatization framed around principles of eternal truth. Earth Sink will penetrate your soul to the core. You will not be able to remain neutral or indifferent after reading this book in its entirety. The open minded reader will find answers to some of man’s most profound questions and will likely come away with even more questions and some intensely emotional opinions. Earth Sink contains personal dreams experienced by the author and is based in part on the author's dreams. It is written mostly in narrative form with very little dialog. The eternal future of every individual on earth, alive or dead, hangs in the balance. A simple vicarious work can tip the scales toward eternal life. The sheer volume of vicarious work to be done is astronomical. Scant few ever attempt it. Will they endure long enough to complete the work, or will they succumb to the swelling tides of evil? While offering insights into theological anthropology and eschatology, Earth Sink depicts the tragic results of prevailing modern societal trends. The book exposes the primordial roots of political influences operating works of darkness that drive a progressive global state of affairs that exclusively favors the world's elites at the expense of liberty and individual freedoms. Earth Sink warns about the deliberate dismantling of the United States constitution from the inside by a compromised and corrupted executive branch of American government collaborating with secret combinations of banking cartels, mega corporations, and terrorist organizations. The most powerful position in the world is handed over to diabolical figures bent on seating a world government that opposes every virtue that once set mankind above beasts. The catastrophic consequences of globalized mainstream sociopolitical movements leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ are unrelentingly drilled home in overwhelmingly graphic detail unleashed from the vivid and explosive imagination of the author. Earth Sink does not skimp on cataclysmic mayhem and apocalyptic doom. Take heed if you want to live. End times have already been underway longer than you realize. Earth Sink is a scathing and brutal portent. The author is absolutely unmindful of reader sensitivity. He employs no semblance of political correctness. Some readers may find parts of the story extremely disturbing, offensive, and controversial. Though written as fiction, the story alludes to the serious truth of what is going on around us and among us right now. In addition to whetting the inquisitive mind with a glimpse of cutting edge science and futuristic technologies, Earth Sink is both politically relevant and spiritually applicable to everyone. It describes a globalized society driven by influences that promote and then exploit worldwide pacifism, greed, envy, pride, and chaos which in turn drives a desperate need for change. Upon that desperate need for change, the world's elites slide into coveted positions of absolute power and total control while their bovine, unthinking constituents and porcine subjects wallow in passive complacency, recklessly relying on the mercies of those they have allowed to gain power over them. All will be well, or will it? Earth Sink extrapolates a possible future from past and present issues. Read the story as if it were real. Some of it is unequivocally real. Some of it may become real. Ponder it carefully and decide for yourself what is real and what is fiction. Beware, your time will soon run out. Earth Sink was written to do more than merely entertain. It was written as a wake up call to change lives, hopefully for the better.",,,,May 24th 2010,[],Paperback,[],,9780976800439,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1301480915l/10922494.jpg,3.25,[],100.0,1.0,,10922494-earth-sink,,,,,75.0,4.0,496,,Ilyan Kei Lavanway,[],,,[],,

"Immaculée Ilibagiza, Steve Erwin, Rick Warren (Foreword by)",Led by Faith: Rising from the Ashes of the Rwandan Genocide,,English,,"For three months in the spring of 1994, the African nation of Rwanda descended into one of the most vicious and bloody genocides the world has ever seen. Immaculée Ilibagiza, a young university student, miraculously survived the savage killing spree that left most of her family, friends, and a million of her fellow citizens dead. Immaculée’s remarkable story of survival was documented in her first book, Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust.In Led By Faith, Immaculée takes us with her as her remarkable journey continues. Through her simple and eloquent voice, we experience her hardships and heartache as she struggles to survive and to find meaning and purpose in the aftermath of the holocaust. It is the story of a naïve and vulnerable young woman, orphaned and alone, navigating through a bleak and dangerously hostile world with only an abiding faith in God to guide and protect her. Immaculée fends off sinister new predators, seeks out and comforts scores of children orphaned by the genocide, and searches for love and companionship in a land where hatred still flourishes. Then, fearing again for her safety as Rwanda’s war-crime trials begin, Immaculée flees to America to begin a new chapter of her life as a refugee and immigrant—a stranger in a strange land.With the same courage and faith in God that led her through the darkness of genocide, Immaculée discovers a new life that was beyond her wildest dreams as a small girl in a tiny village in one of Africa’s poorest countries.It is in the United States, her adopted country, where Immaculée can finally look back at all that has happened to her and truly understand why God spared her life . . . so that she would be left to tell her story to the world.",,,09/16/08,September 15th 2009,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Africa', 'Catholic', 'Rwanda', 'Autobiography', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'History']",,9781401918880,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328770399l/2921701.jpg,4.42,[],98.0,1.0,,2921701-led-by-faith,,,,,98.0,1601.0,324,,Hay House,"['911', '498', '154', '27', '11']",,,[],,

  'The purpose of this critique of pure speculative reason consists in the attempt to change the old procedure of metaphysics and to bring about a complete revolution'
Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) is the central text of modern philosophy. It presents a profound and challenging investigation into the nature of human reason, its knowledge and its illusions. Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts. The Critique brings together the two opposing schools of philosophy: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience.

The second half of the critique concentrates on the apparent teleology in nature's design of organisms. Kant argues that our minds are inclined to see purpose and order in nature and this is the main principle underlying all of our judgments.

"Immanuel Wallerstein, إيمانويل والرشتاين, أكرم علي حمدان (Translator)",تحليل النظم الدولية,,Arabic,,"In World-Systems Analysis, Immanuel Wallerstein provides a concise and accessible introduction to the comprehensive approach that he pioneered thirty years ago to understanding the history and development of the modern world. Since Wallerstein first developed world-systems analysis, it has become a widely utilized methodology within the historical social sciences and a common point of reference in discussions of globalization. Now, for the first time in one volume, Wallerstein offers a succinct summary of world-systems analysis and a clear outline of the modern world-system, describing the structures of knowledge upon which it is based, its mechanisms, and its future.Wallerstein explains the defining characteristics of world-systems analysis: its emphasis on world-systems rather than nation-states, on the need to consider historical processes as they unfold over long periods of time, and on combining within a single analytical framework bodies of knowledge usually viewed as distinct from one another—such as history, political science, economics, and sociology. He describes the world-system as a social reality comprised of interconnected nations, firms, households, classes, and identity groups of all kinds. He identifies and highlights the significance of the key moments in the evolution of the modern world-system: the development of a capitalist world-economy in the sixteenth-century, the beginning of two centuries of liberal centrism in the French Revolution of 1789, and the undermining of that centrism in the global revolts of 1968.

Imran Khan,Pakistan: A Personal History,,English,,"Born only five years after Pakistan was created in 1947, Imran Khan has lived his country's history. Undermined by a ruling elite hungry for money and power, Pakistan now stands alone as the only Islamic country with a nuclear bomb, yet it is unable to protect its people from the carnage of regular bombings from terrorists and its own ally, America. Now with the revelation that Pakistan has been the hiding place of Osama bin Laden for several years, that relationship can only grow more strained. How did it reach this flashpoint of instability and injustice with such potentially catastrophic results for Pakistan?Recounting his country's history through the prism of his own memories, Imran Khan starts from its foundation, ripped out of the dying British Raj. He guides us through and comments on subsequent historical developments which shook the Muslim world - the wars with India in 1965 and 1971, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and America's retribution 10 years later with the assassination of bin Laden - to the current controversial and intractable war in Afghanistan.We see these events viewed not only through the eyes of Westerners, but through those of ordinary Pakistanis.Drawing on the experiences of his own family and his wide travels within his homeland, Pakistan: A Personal History provides a unique insider's view of a country unfamiliar to a western audience. Woven into this history we see how Imran Khan's personal life - his happy childhood in Lahore, his Oxford education, his extraordinary cricketing career, his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, his mother's influence and that of his Islamic faith - inform both the historical narrative and his current philanthropic and political activities.

"Imre Kertész, Tim Wilkinson (Translator)",Kaddish for an Unborn Child,,English,,"The first word in this mesmerizing novel by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature is “No.” It is how the novel’s narrator, a middle-aged Hungarian-Jewish writer, answers an acquaintance who asks him if he has a child. It is the answer he gave his wife (now ex-wife) years earlier when she told him she wanted one. The loss, longing and regret that haunt the years between those two “no”s give rise to one of the most eloquent meditations ever written on the Holocaust. As Kertesz’s narrator addresses the child he couldn’t bear to bring into the world he ushers readers into the labyrinth of his consciousness, dramatizing the paradoxes attendant on surviving the catastrophe of Auschwitz. Kaddish for the Unborn Child is a work of staggering power, lit by flashes of perverse wit and fueled by the energy of its wholly original voice.

He does not understand the reason for his fate. He doesn’t particularly think of himself as Jewish. And his fellow prisoners, who decry his lack of Yiddish, keep telling him, “You are no Jew.” In the lowest circle of the Holocaust, Georg remains an outsider.The genius of Imre Kertesz’s unblinking novel lies in its refusal to mitigate the strangeness of its events, not least of which is Georg’s dogmatic insistence on making sense of what he witnesses–or pretending that what he witnesses makes sense.

Anthology,,English,,"What would it take to end violence against women of color? How does the mainstream antiviolence movement help? How does it hinder? When will we admit that repositioning women of color at the center of the movement--women more often harmed by the police, prisons, and border patrols than aided by them--means that we must address state violence?In Color of Violence, INCITE! demands that we• reconsider a reliance on the criminal justice system for solving women’s struggles with domestic violence;• acknowledge how militarism subjects women to extreme levels of violence perpetrated from within, and without, their communities;• recognize how the medical establishment inflicts violence--such as involuntary sterilization and inadequate health care--on women of color;• devise new strategies for cross-cultural dialogue, theorizing, and alliance building;• and much, much more.INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence was born in 2000, when more than two thousand dedicated activists from diverse communities came together to end the war being waged on women of color in the US and around the world. Now the largest multiracial, grassroots, feminist organization in the United States, INCITE! boasts chapters in more than 20 cities. Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology presents the fierce and vital writing of 32 of these visionaries, who not only shift the focus from domestic violence and sexual assault, but also map innovative strategies of movement building and resistance used by women of color around the world.

It is a dark world, shot through with flashes of joy and lunacy.""I used to be human once. So I'm told. I don't remember it myself, but people who knew me when I was small say I walked on two feet, just like a human being..."" Ever since he can remember, Animal has gone on all fours, his back twisted beyond repair by the catastrophic events of ""that night"" when a burning fog of poison smoke from the local factory blazed out over the town of Khaufpur, and the Apocalypse visited his slums. Now just turned seventeen and well schooled in street work, he lives by his wits, spending his days jamisponding (spying) on town officials and looking after the elderly nun who raised him, Ma Franci. His nights are spent fantasizing about Nisha, the girlfriend of the local resistance leader, and wondering what it must be like to get laid. When Elli Barber, a young American doctor, arrives in Khaufpur to open a free clinic for the still suffering townsfolk -- only to find herself struggling to convince them that she isn't there to do the dirty work of the Kampani -- Animal gets caught up in a web of intrigues, scams, and plots with the unabashed aim of turning events to his own advantage. Profane, piercingly honest, and scathingly funny, Animal's People illuminates a dark world shot through with flashes of joy and lunacy.

Indu Sundaresan (Goodreads Author),The Twentieth Wife,,English,,"An enchanting seventeenth-century epic of grand passion and adventure, this debut novel tells the captivating story of one of India's most legendary and controversial empresses -- a woman whose brilliance and determination trumped myriad obstacles, and whose love shaped the course of the Mughal empire.She came into the world in the year 1577, to the howling accompaniment of a ferocious winter storm. As the daughter of starving refugees fleeing violent persecution in Persia, her fateful birth in a roadside tent sparked a miraculous reversal of family fortune, culminating in her father's introduction to the court of Emperor Akbar. She is called Mehrunnisa, the Sun of Women. This is her story.Growing up on the fringes of Emperor Akbar's opulent palace grounds, Mehrunnisa blossoms into a sapphire-eyed child blessed with a precocious intelligence, luminous beauty, and a powerful ambition far surpassing the bounds of her family's station. Mehrunnisa first encounters young Prince Salim on his wedding day. In that instant, even as a royal gala swirls around her in celebration of the future emperor's first marriage, Mehrunnisa foresees the path of her own destiny. One day, she decides with uncompromising surety, she too will become Salim's wife. She is all of eight years old -- and wholly unaware of the great price she and her family will pay for this dream.Skillfully blending the textures of historical reality with the rich and sensuous imaginings of a timeless fairy tale, The Twentieth Wife sweeps readers up in the emotional pageant of Salim and Mehrunnisa's embattled love. First-time novelist Indu Sundaresan charts her heroine's enthralling journey across the years, from an ill-fated first marriage through motherhood and into a dangerous maze of power struggles and political machinations. Through it all, Mehrunnisa and Salim long with fiery intensity for the true, redemptive love they've never known -- and their mutual quest ultimately takes them, and the vast empire that hangs in the balance, to places they never dreamed possible.Shot through with wonder and suspense, The Twentieth Wife is at once a fascinating portrait of one woman's convention-defying life behind the veil and a transporting saga of the astonishing potency of love.",Taj Mahal Trilogy #1,,01/29/02,February 18th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'India', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Asia', 'Indian Literature', 'Cultural', 'Adult', '16th Century']",,9780743428187,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441836224l/27298._SY475_.jpg,4.05,['Washington State Book Award (2003)'],203.0,3.0,,27298.The_Twentieth_Wife,,,,,95.0,13255.0,380,,Washington Square Press,"['4690', '5340', '2526', '554', '145']",,,['India'],,
Indu Sundaresan (Goodreads Author),The Feast of Roses,,English,,"The love story of Emperor Jahangir and Mehrunnisa, begun in the critically praised debut novel The Twentieth Wife, continues in Indu Sundaresan's The Feast of Roses. This lush new novel tells the story behind one of the great tributes to romantic love and one of the seven wonders of the world -- the Taj Mahal.Mehrunnisa, better known as Empress Nur Jahan, comes into Jahangir's harem as his twentieth and last wife. Almost from the beginning of her royal life she fits none of the established norms of womanhood in seventeenth-century India.Mehrunnisa is the first woman Jahangir marries for love, at the ""old"" age of thirty-four. He loves her so deeply that he eventually transfers his powers of sovereignty to her.Power and wealth do not come easily to Mehrunnisa -- she has to fight for them. She has a formidable rival in the imperial harem, Empress Jagat Gosini, who has schemed and plotted against Mehrunnisa from early on. Mehrunnisa's problems do not just lie within the harem walls, but at court, too, as she battles powerful ministers for supremacy. These ministers, who have long had Emperor Jahangir's confidence and trust, consider Mehrunnisa a mere woman who cannot have a voice in the outside world.Mehrunnisa combats all of this by forming a junta of sorts with three men she can rely on -- her father, her brother, and Jahangir's son Prince Khurram. She demonstrates great strength of character and cunning to get what she wants, sometimes at a cost of personal sorrow when she almost loses her daughter's love. But she never loses the love of the man who bestows this power upon her -- Emperor Jahangir.

Indumathi,Surrendered Dreams,,,,"This is the English translation of Indumathi's Tamil novel, 'Tharaiyil Irangum Vimanangal', which was first published in 1977.  Bound by a sense of filial duty, Parasu, the eldest son of Jagannathan, gives up his dreams of higher studies and settles down to a safe and secure government job. His younger brother Viswam knows little of his inner struggle. Viswam also dreams big and pities Parasu for his lack of ambition while envying him his lovely wife, but when reality hits him, Viswam is forced into a deeper understanding of the way we want life to be and the way it really is.    Surrendered Dreams is a coming-of-age story, sensitively and sympathetically written.    About the Author  Indumathi made a substantial impact on readers of Tamil fiction with her serialised novel Tharaiyil Irangum Vimanangal back in the 1970s. Known for her bold, occasionally, controversial themes, she began her writing career at the age of 16. Her articles and stories were published in Tamil magazines like Jnana Ratham, Ananda Vikatan and Kumudam.  Indumathi has been greatly inspired by the works of T Janakiraman, Jayakanthan and Vannadasan—names familiar to serious readers of contemporary Tamil writing. ‘I owe my writing to them,’ she says. Her childhood neighbour, the late Akhilon—a renowned Tamil writer—was her mentor, and in a way, instrumental in kick-starting her literary career.

Find out how Kyrielle handles this situation in this tantalizing read. It's a classic tale of lust, drama, drugs and war, but with a southern twist! Set in New Orleans, Louisiana, Never Satisfied is a story about envy and how it possesses the power to demolish anything standing in its path once one becomes consumed by it. Twenty-two year old Jasmine Harris learns this lesson the hard way when her covetousness for the lavish life style of her best friend, Kyrielle, spirals out of control. Just when Jasmine thinks she has reached the pinnacle of the status that she has underhandedly worked so hard to obtain, she finds out that nothing is what it seems and ends up tangled in a huge web of deceit that results in bloodshed.

Inge Sargent,Twilight Over Burma: My Life as a Shan Princess,,English,,"Just married and returning to live in her new husband's native land, a young Austrian woman arrived with her Burmese husband by passenger ship in Rangoon in 1953. They were met at dockside by hundreds of well-wishers displaying colorful banners, playing music on homemade instruments, and carrying giant bouquets of flowers. She was puzzled by this unusual welcome until her embarrassed husband explained that he was something more than a recently graduated mining engineer - he was the Prince of Hsipaw, the ruler of an autonomous state in Burma's Shan mountains. And these people were his subjects!She immersed herself in the Shan lifestyle, eagerly learning the language, the culture, and the history of the Shan hill people. The Princess of Hsipaw fell in love with this remote, exotic land and its warm and friendly people. She worked at her husband's side to bring change and modernization to their primitive country. Her efforts to improve the education and health care of the country, and her husband's commitment to improve the economic well-being of the people made them one of the most popular ruling couples in Southeast Asia. Then the violent military coup of 1962 shattered the idyllic existence of the previous ten years. Her life irrevocably changed. Inge Sargent tells a story of a life most of us can only dream about. She vividly describes the social, religious, and political events she experienced. She details the day-to-day living as a reluctant ruler and her role as her husband's equal - a role that perplexed the males in Hsipaw and created awe in the females. And then she describes the military events that threatened her life and that of her children.Twilight over Burma is a story of a great happiness destroyed by evil, of one woman's determination and bravery against a ruthless military regime, and of the truth behind the overthrow of one of Burma's most popular local leaders.",,,11/06/94,August 1st 1994,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Travel', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780824816285,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387752147l/1638068.jpg,3.8,[],55.0,1.0,,1638068.Twilight_Over_Burma,,,,,93.0,536.0,240,,Kolowalu Books,"['133', '207', '159', '30', '7']",,,[],,

Ingmar Bergman,Laterna Magica,,Danish,,"
  
    
      “When a film is not a document, it is a dream. . . . At the editing table, when I run the strip of film through, frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood.” Bergman, who has conveyed this heady sense of wonder and vision to moviegoers for decades, traces his lifelong love affair with film in his breathtakingly visual autobiography, The Magic Lantern.More grand mosaic than linear account, Bergman’s vignettes trace his life from a rural Swedish childhood through his work in theater to Hollywood’s golden age, and a tumultuous romantic history that includes five wives and more than a few mistresses. Throughout, Bergman recounts his life in a series of deeply personal flashbacks that document some of the most important moments in twentieth-century filmmaking as well as the private obsessions of the man behind them. Ambitious in scope yet sensitively wrought, The Magic Lantern is a window to the mind of one of our era’s great geniuses. “[Bergman] has found a way to show the soul’s landscape . . . . Many gripping revelations.”—New York Times Book Review “Joan Tate’s translation of this book has delicacy and true pitch . . . The Magic Lantern is as personal and penetrating as a Bergman film, wry, shadowy, austere.”—New Republic “[Bergman] keeps returning to his past, reassessing it, distilling its meaning, offering it to his audiences in dazzling new shapes.”—New York Times “What Bergman does relate, particularly his tangled relationships with his parents, is not only illuminating but quite moving. No ‘tell-all’ book this one, but revealing in ways that much longer and allegedly ‘franker’ books are not.”—Library Journal

Ingrid Hill,"Ursula, Under",,English,,"In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a dangerous rescue effort draws the ears and eyes of the entire country. A two-and-a-half-year-old girl has fallen down a mine shaft--the only sound is an astonished tiny intake of breath from Ursula as she goes down, like a penny into the slot of a bank, disappeared, gone. It is as if all hope for life on the planet is bound up in the rescue of this little girl, the first and only child of a young woman of Finnish extraction and her Chinese-American husband. One TV viewer following the action notes that the Wong family lives in a decrepit mobile home and wonders why all this time and money is being wasted on that half-breed trailer-trash kid. In response, the novel takes a breathtaking leap back in time to visit Ursula's most remarkable ancestors: a third-century-B.C. Chinese alchemist; an orphaned playmate of a seventeenth-century Swedish queen; Professor Alabaster Wong, a Chautauqua troupe lecturer (on exotic Chinese topics) traveling the Midwest at the end of the nineteenth century; her great-great-grandfather Jake Maki, who died at twenty-nine in a Michigan iron mine cave-in; and others whose richness and history are contained in the induplicable DNA of just one person--little Ursula Wong.Ursula's story echoes those of her ancestors, many of whom so narrowly escaped not being born that her very existence--like ours--comes to seem a miracle.

Ingrid Noll,Die Häupter meiner Lieben,,German,," Oberflächlich betrachtet sind Cora und Maja zwei ganz normale 16-jährige Mädchen, die füreinander durch dick und dünn gehen. Doch wehe es macht ihnen irgendjemand Schwierigkeiten. Gleichgültig um wen es sich handelt, sei es der Bruder, der Freund oder später der Mann: Wer stört, stirbt, schnell und schmerzlos, ohne viel Federlesens. Ganz ohne Moral und falsches Mitleid. Ihre Morde sind so klug gemacht, dass kein Polizist auf den Gedanken kommt, tumbe Nachforschungen anzustellen. Begonnen hat ihre Freundschaft damit, dass Maja, die gewandte und vor Einfällen sprühende Cora mit auf ihre Diebestouren nimmt. Eigentlich interessieren Maja die geklauten Sachen überhaupt nicht und meistens schmeißt sie diese sofort weg. Für sie sind diese kleinen Kavalierinnendelikte eine Möglichkeit, der engen und düsteren Familiensituation zu entkommen. Da ist ihr ständig betrunkener Vater, ein Möchtegern-Maler, der sich von der depressiven Mutter getrennt hat, und ihr ewig stichelnder Bruder. Das wird ihr alles zuviel. Da geht sie lieber zu Cora, der Tochter eines Sinologie-Professors, die sehr viel Zeit und noch bessere Ideen hat, da ihre Eltern ständig in der Welt herumreisen oder Vernissagen besuchen. Die beiden Mädchen gehen schonungslos und herrlich erfrischend mit der Männerwelt um. Als Maja ein Baby erwartet und das spießige Familienleben sie einzuholen droht, wird sie von Cora nach Florenz eingeladen, die dort in der Zwischenzeit einen gutbetuchten, älteren Bauunternehmer kennen gelernt hat. Doch auch im sonnigen Florenz wollen die Männer nicht immer so wie sie sollen und die beiden jungen Frauen müssen ihrem Glück auf die Sprünge helfen. Nichts kann sie jedoch davon abhalten, genau dies zu bekommen, was sie sich vorgenommen haben. Egal, ob es sich dabei um eine seladongrüne Vase aus der Sung-Dynastie handelt oder um die alte toskanische Villa in Florenz. Am Ende geht die Rechnung immer zu ihren Gunsten auf. Krimiautorinnen der Klasse einer Ingrid Noll haben bislang in Deutschland bitter gefehlt. Schon ihr Debüt Der Hahn ist tot war ein guter Krimi, doch mit dem Roman Die Häupter meiner Lieben schrieb sie sich an die Spitze der Krimifrauen. Es ist ein richtiger Genuss, sich von der herrlichen Bösartigkeit und Gemeinheit des Romans treiben zu lassen -- bitte mehr davon. --Manuela Haselberger",Cora und Maja #1,,11/06/93,October 1st 2000,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Roman', 'Suspense', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery', 'Humor']",,9783257227260,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1188849431l/1823730._SY475_.jpg,3.95,['Friedrich-Glauser-Preis for Kriminalroman (1994)'],79.0,1.0,,1823730.Die_H_upter_meiner_Lieben,,,,,95.0,675.0,279,,Diogenes Verlag,"['208', '272', '158', '29', '8']",,,[],,

Die Ansammlung an orthografischen sowie grammatikalischen Fehlern (gerade sehr extrem bei „Die Geschichte von Lakritz Charlie und Tulpen Tom“) ist bewusst so integriert und beibehalten worden.

Iona Grey's prose is warm, evocative, and immediately engaging; her characters become so real you can't bear to let them go.I promised to love you forever, in a time when I didn't know if I'd live to see the start of another week. Now it looks like forever is finally running out. I never stopped loving you. I tried, for the sake of my own sanity, but I never even got close, and I never stopped hoping either.Late on a frozen February evening, a young woman is running through the streets of London. Having fled from her abusive boyfriend and with nowhere to go, Jess stumbles onto a forgotten lane where a small, clearly unlived in old house offers her best chance of shelter for the night. The next morning, a mysterious letter arrives and when she can't help but open it, she finds herself drawn inexorably into the story of two lovers from another time. In London 1942, Stella meets Dan, a US airman, quite by accident, but there is no denying the impossible, unstoppable attraction that draws them together. Dan is a B-17 pilot flying his bomber into Europe from a British airbase; his odds of survival are one in five. In the midst of such uncertainty, the one thing they hold onto is the letters they write to each other. Fate is unkind and they are separated by decades and continents. In the present, Jess becomes determined to find out what happened to them.

Ira Levin,A Kiss Before Dying,,,Fiction,"A Kiss Before Dying not only debuted the talent of best-selling novelist Ira Levin to rave reviews, it also set a new standard in the art of mystery and suspense. Now a modern classic, as gripping in its tautly plotted action as it is penetrating in its exploration of a criminal mind, it tells the shocking tale of a young man who will stop at nothing—not even murder—to get where he wants to go. For he has dreams; plans. He also has charm, good looks, sex appeal, intelligence. And he has a problem. Her name is Dorothy; she loves him, and she’s pregnant. The solution may demand desperate measures. But, then, he looks like the kind of guy who could get away with murder.

Ira Levin,The Boys from Brazil,,English,,"Alive and hiding in South America, the fiendish Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele gathers a group of former colleagues for a horrifying project—the creation of the Fourth Reich. Barry Kohler, a young investigative journalist, gets wind of the project and informs famed Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman, but before he can relay the evidence, Kohler is killed. Thus Ira Levin opens one of the strangest and most masterful novels of his career. Why has Mengele marked a number of harmless aging men for murder? What is the hidden link that binds them?

And they employ a team of often brutal detectives whose main job it is to go around and disrupt independent films, breaking cameras and even heads if necessary. With a colorful crew of actors, Adam and Emily head to Fort Lee, New Jersey where they set shooting the films to fulfill their contract. After evading Edison’s detectives a couple of times, one of them arrives on the set in time for a major crowd scene. And, while almost everyone’s back is turned, he is murdered.

"Irene Solà, Concha Cardeñoso (Translator)",Canto yo y la montaña baila,,Spanish,,"Primero llegan la tormenta y el rayo y la muerte de Domènec, el campesino poeta. Luego, Dolceta, que no puede parar de reír mientras cuenta las historias de las cuatro mujeres a las que colgaron por brujas. Sió, que tiene que criar sola a Mia e Hilari ahí arriba en Matavaques. Y las trompetas de los muertos, que, con su sombrero negro y apetitoso, anuncian la inmutabilidad del ciclo de la vida.Canto yo y la montaña baila es una novela en la que toman la palabra mujeres y hombres, fantasmas y mujeres de agua, nubes y setas, perros y corzos que habitan entre Camprodon y Prats de Molló, en los Pirineos. Una zona de alta montaña y de frontera que, más allá de la leyenda, conserva la memoria de siglos de lucha por la supervivencia, de persecuciones guiadas por la ignorancia y el fanatismo, de guerras fratricidas, pero que encarna también una belleza a la que no le hacen falta muchos adjetivos. Un terreno fértil para liberar la imaginación y el pensamiento, las ganas de hablar y de contar historias. Un lugar, quizás, para empezar de nuevo y encontrar cierta redención.De la obra de Irene Solà se ha dicho: «Lo que triunfa en todo el relato es la alegría de narrar» (Ponç Puigdevall, El País); «El oficio narrativo entendido como un esfuerzo de construcción, de ir y volver, de no dar nada por bueno a la primera, de jugar con la fina línea que separa la realidad y la ficción» (Esteve Plantada, Nació Digital).",,,05/08/19,June 5th 2019,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Magical Realism', 'Spanish Literature', 'Spain', 'Literary Fiction', 'Nature']",,9788433998774,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1559139214l/45479298._SY475_.jpg,4.32,[],85.0,1.0,,45479298-canto-yo-y-la-monta-a-baila,,,,,96.0,2073.0,200,,Anagrama,"['1092', '656', '244', '60', '21']",,,[],,
Irene Spencer,"Cult Insanity: A Memoir of Polygamy, Prophets, and Blood Atonement",,English,,"Life for Irene Spencer was a series of devastating disappointments and hardships. Irene's first book, Shattered Dreams, is the staggering chronicle of her struggle to provide for her children in abject poverty and feelings of abandonment each time her husband left to be with one of his other wives. Irene was raised to believe polygamy was the way of life necessary for her ticket to heaven. The hard knocks of her environment were just the beginning of Irene's shocking tale. Insanity ran rampant in her husband's family and was the source of inconceivable events that unfolded throughout Irene's adult life. CULT INSANITY takes readers deeper into her story to uncover the outrageous behavior of her brother-in-law Ervil -- a self-proclaimed prophet who determined he was called to set the house of God in order -- and how he terrorized their colony. Claiming to be God's avenger and to have a license to kill in the name of God, Ervil ordered the murders of friends and family members, eliminating all those who challenged his authority. For those who were gripped by Shattered Dreams, the rest of the story will blow them away.

"Irfan Orga, Ateş Orga (Afterword)",Portrait of a Turkish Family,,English,,"Describes in chilling, yet affectionate, detail the disintegration of a wealthy Ottoman family, both financially and emotionally. It is rich with the scent of fin de siecle Istanbul in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. His mother was a beauty, married at thirteen, as befitted a Turkish woman of her class. His grandmother was an eccentric autocrat, determined at all costs to maintain her traditional habits. But the war changed everything. Death and financial disaster reigned, the Sultan was overthrown, and Turkey became a republic. The red fez was ousted by the cloth cap, and the family was forced to adapt to an unimaginably impoverished life. Filled with brilliant vignettes of old Turkish life, such as the ritual weekly visit to the hamam, as it tells the ""other side"" of the Gallipoli story, and its impact on one family and the transformation of a nation.

But the man who took the scientist is a ruthless and heartless killer whose primary objective is carrying out his sadistic revenge on Logan. Sarah, none too happy about being coerced into helping Logan, becomes even less inclined toward him when Monty is wounded in the rescue attempt. Logan is wounded too, and after their mission has been accomplished, the threesome end up back at Sarah's isolated cabin. Sarah does everything she can to make Logan leave but finds it hard to be too insistent given his wounds. Besides, when Logan pays his debt to her for completing the mission, it is something Sarah could never have anticipated, an act that leaves her stunned, confused, and indebted. As for Logan, he refuses to leave Sarah alone because he knows that his nemesis, Rudzak, saw her and Monty in Colombia. And because of the nature of his relationship with Rudzak and the secret history they share, Logan knows the psycho will eventually come after Sarah. Holed up together and fighting a wide array of emotions, Sarah and Logan discover a spark of passion between them. Though they both try to resist, eventually the spark ignites a full-fledged conflagration that leaves both of them stunned, puzzled, and forever changed. By the time the inevitable confrontation with Rudzak occurs, Logan will be forced to risk both his life and his heart in hopes of keeping Sarah and Monty safe. And Sarah must risk everything she holds dear if she ever hopes to find a happiness she is only now beginning to realize. Fans of Johansen's previous books in this series, The Face of Deception and The Killing Game, will enjoy brief though hair-raising appearances by Eve, Joe Quinn, and Jane -- the spunky, street-wise child Eve adopted in the last book. Also filling out the character roster is an intriguing love interest for Monty: an injured gray wolf named Maggie. But the best parts of Johansen's latest effort are her characteristically explosive mix of chilling terror and heated passion and her gift for weaving a tale of intrigue where seeing isn't necessarily believing. Beth Amos",Eve Duncan #3,,01/01/00,July 25th 2006,['Eve Duncan'],Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Romance', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Adult']",,9780553589481,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386923062l/94299.jpg,4.15,[],314.0,4.0,,94299.The_Search,,,,,97.0,14759.0,308,,Bantam Books,"['5887', '5666', '2791', '346', '69']",,,"['United States of America', 'Arizona (United States)']",,

"Iris Muller-Westermann (Contributor), Pascal Rousseau (Text), David Lomas (Text), Hilma af Klint (Illustrations)",Hilma AF Klint: A Pioneer of Abstraction,,English,,"Just before her death in 1944 at the age of 81, the Swedish painter and mystic Hilma af Klint stipulated that her paintings were not to be publicly exhibited for 20 years. In fact, another 40-plus years were to pass before inklings of her vast oeuvre began to reach public consciousness, with the landmark 1987 exhibition and book The Spiritual in Art. Since then, critics, artists and historians have praised her with ever-increasing awe, and today af Klint's paintings, watercolors and sketches--numbering over 1,000 in total--have never looked so contemporary, presaging as they do the works of Beatriz Milhazes, Elizabeth Murray and Tal R., and Agnes Martin, Emma Kunz and Arthur Dove before them. For af Klint herself, as a medium for an art she was despairingly unable to comprehend, contemporaneity was irrelevant: her work--much of which was dictated by a spirit guide named Ananda--unfolded in complete ignorance of Kandinsky, Malevich or Mondrian, who likewise practised an abstraction informed by theosophy and occult philosophy. Af Klint's abstractions preceded those of Kandinsky, who is usually credited with inventing abstract painting: as early as 1906, she was devising large-scale canvases filled with grids, circles, spirals and petal-like forms--sometimes diagrammatic, sometimes biomorphic. She was painting watercolor monochromes in 1916, and making automatic drawings long before the Surrealists. This monumental 280-page monograph, with 200 color plates, is the first full Hilma af Klint overview. A landmark publication, it not only reveals the moving lucidity of her art, but challenges the narrative of abstract art in the twentieth century.",,,May 31st 2013,June 30th 2013,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Art History', 'Sweden']",,9783775734899,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389574274l/17195164.jpg,4.63,[],44.0,1.0,,17195164-hilma-af-klint,,,,,100.0,51.0,280,,Hatje Cantz,"['35', '13', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new ""RULES"" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers.

Irmgard A. Hunt,On Hitler's Mountain: Overcoming the Legacy of a Nazi Childhood,,English,,"A powerful and riveting account of a seemingly halcyon life lived mere paces from a center of evil and madness; a remarkable memoir of an ""ordinary"" childhood spent in an extraordinary time and place.On Hitler's Mountain is a powerful, intimate, riveting, and revealing account of a seemingly halcyon life lived mere paces from a center of evil and madness; a remarkable memoir of an ""ordinary"" childhood spent in an extraordinary time and place.Born in 1934, Irmgard Hunt grew up in the picturesque Bavarian village of Berchtesgaden, in the shadow of the Eagle's Nest and near Adolf Hitler's luxurious alpine retreat. The very model of blond Aryan ""purity,"" Irmgard sat on the Führer's knee for photographers, witnessed with excitement the comings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so eagerly embraced. Here, in a picture-postcard world untouched by the war and seemingly unblemished by the horrors Germany's master had wrought, she accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and joyfully sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.But before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the ""truths"" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, often feeling lonely in her quest, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for an almost unbearable reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her commitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.Provocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.",,,03/01/05,January 31st 2006,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'Germany', 'Autobiography', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780060532185,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407708176l/54330.jpg,3.95,[],48.0,1.0,,54330.On_Hitler_s_Mountain,,,,,95.0,3118.0,278,,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['903', '1339', '723', '119', '34']",,,[],,

Irvin D.

Seymour is a therapist of the old school who blurs the boundary of sexual propriety with one of his clients. Marshal, who is haunted by his own obsessive-compulsive behaviors, is troubled by the role money plays in his dealings with his patients. Finally, there is Ernest Lash. Driven by his sincere desire to help and his faith in psychoanalysis, he invents a radically new approach to therapy -- a totally open and honest relationship with a patient that threatens to have devastating results.Exposing the many lies that are told on and off the psychoanalyst's couch, Lying on the Couch gives readers a tantalizing, almost illicit, glimpse at what their therapists might really be thinking during their sessions.

Irvin D. Yalom,The Spinoza Problem,,English,,"When sixteen-year-old Alfred Rosenberg is called into his headmaster’s office for anti-Semitic remarks he made during a school speech, he is forced, as punishment, to memorize passages about Spinoza from the autobiography of the German poet Goethe. Rosenberg is stunned to discover that Goethe, his idol, was a great admirer of the Jewish seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Long after graduation, Rosenberg remains haunted by this “Spinoza problem”: how could the German genius Goethe have been inspired by a member of a race Rosenberg considers so inferior to his own, a race he was determined to destroy?Spinoza himself was no stranger to punishment during his lifetime. Because of his unorthodox religious views, he was excommunicated from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656, at the age of twenty-four, and banished from the only world he had ever known. Though his life was short and he lived without means in great isolation, he nonetheless produced works that changed the course of history. Over the years, Rosenberg rose through the ranks to become an outspoken Nazi ideologue, a faithful servant of Hitler, and the main author of racial policy for the Third Reich. Still, his Spinoza obsession lingered. By imagining the unexpected intersection of Spinoza’s life with Rosenberg’s, internationally bestselling novelist Irvin D. Yalom explores the mindsets of two men separated by 300 years. Using his skills as a psychiatrist, he explores the inner lives of Spinoza, the saintly secular philosopher, and of Rosenberg, the godless mass murderer.",,,10/30/12,March 6th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Fiction', 'Psychology', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'American', 'Contemporary', 'The United States Of America']",,9780465029631,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344692296l/12715691.jpg,4.2,['WIZO Literatuurprijs (2013)'],97.0,1.0,,12715691-the-spinoza-problem,,,,,96.0,8957.0,321,,Basic Books (AZ),"['3928', '3347', '1330', '280', '72']",,,[],,

Creatures of a Day is a radically honest statement about the difficulties of human life, but also a celebration of some of the finest fruits -- love, family, friendship -- it can offer.

Irvine Welsh,Glue,,English,,"Glue is the story of four boys growing up in the Edinburgh schemes, and about the loyalties, the experiences - and the secrets - that hold them together into their thirties. Four boys becoming men: Juice Terry, the work-shy fanny-merchant, with corkscrew curls and sticky fingers; Billy the boxer: driven, controlled, playing to his strengths; Carl, the Milky Bar Kid, drifting along to his own soundtrack; and the doomed Gally - who has one less skin than everyone else and seems to find catastrophe at every corner. As we follow their lives from the seventies into the new century - from punk to techno, from speed to Es - we can see each of them trying to struggle out from under the weight of the conditioning of class and culture, peer pressure and their parents' hopes that maybe their sons will do better than they did. What binds the four of them is the friendship formed by the scheme, their school, and their ambition to escape from both; their loyalty fused in street morality: back up your mates, don't hit women and, most importantly, never grass - on anyone.

Irvine Welsh,Skagboys,,English,,"Mark Renton has it all: he's good-looking, young, with a pretty girlfriend and a place at university. But there's no room for him in the 1980s. Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his family starts to fracture, Mark's life swings out of control and he succumbs to the defeatism which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas. The way out is heroin.It's no better for his friends. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job, Tommy Lawrence feels himself being sucked into a life of petty crime and violence - the worlds of the thieving Matty Connell and psychotic Franco Begbie. Only Sick Boy, the supreme manipulator of the opposite sex, seems to ride the current, scamming and hustling his way through it all.Skagboys charts their journey from likely lads to young men addicted to the heroin which has flooded their disintegrating community. This is the 1980s: a time of drugs, poverty, AIDS, violence, political strife and hatred - but a lot of laughs, and maybe just a little love; a decade which changed Britain for ever.

Irvine Welsh,The Blade Artist,,,,"Jim Francis has finally found the perfect life – and is now unrecognisable, even to himself. A successful painter and sculptor, he lives quietly with his wife, Melanie, and their two young daughters, in an affluent beach town in California. Some say he’s a fake and a con man, while others see him as a genuine visionary.But Francis has a very dark past, with another identity and a very different set of values. When he crosses the Atlantic to his native Scotland, for the funeral of a murdered son he barely knew, his old Edinburgh community expects him to take bloody revenge. But as he confronts his previous life, all those friends and enemies – and, most alarmingly, his former self – Francis seems to have other ideas.When Melanie discovers something gruesome in California, which indicates that her husband’s violent past might also be his psychotic present, things start to go very bad, very quickly.The Blade Artist is an elegant, electrifying novel – ultra violent but curiously redemptive – and it marks the return of one of modern fiction’s most infamous, terrifying characters, the incendiary Francis Begbie from Trainspotting.",Mark Renton #4,,,April 7th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Dark', 'Suspense', 'Drama', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Adult', 'Cult Classics']",,9780224102155,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453058010l/25870405.jpg,3.6,[],1997.0,22.0,,25870405-the-blade-artist,,,,,82.0,6006.0,288,,Jonathan Cape,"['1526', '2036', '1387', '611', '446']",,,[],,

Irvine Welsh,The Acid House,,English,,"
  Description from the inside sleeve:
This scintillating, disturbing, and altogether outrageous collection of stories introduces to these shores a young writer already being called ""the Scottish Celine of the 1990s"" (Guardian) and ""a mad postmodern Roald Dahl"" (Weekend Scotsman). Using a range of approaches from bitter realism to demented fantasy, Irvine Welsh is able to evoke the essential humanity, well hidden as it is, of his generally depraved, lazy, manipulative, and vicious characters. He specializes particularly in cosmic reversals--God turns a hapless footballer into a fly; an acid head and a newborn infant exchange consciousnesses with sardonically unexpected results--always displaying a corrosive wit and a telling accuracy of language and detail. Irvine Welsh is one hilariously dangerous writer and he is bound to create a sensation.

Irving Penn,Small Trades,,English,,"Photographer Irving Penn is renowned for his innovative contributions to portrait, still life, and fashion photography, and a career that spanned more than six decades at Vogue magazine.  In 1950, Vogue assigned Penn to photograph workers in Paris, and thus his monumental work Small Trades began.  Created in 1950 and 1951 in Paris, London and New York, Small Trades consists of portraits of skilled tradespeople dressed in their work clothes and carrying the tools of their respective trades. Capturing the humble coal heaver and the crisply dressed waiter with equal directness, Penn’s arresting portraits also underscore fascinating cultural differences.Small Trades was Penn’s most extensive body of work to which he returned over many decades producing ever more exacting prints. Two hundred-six unique images from the series are flawlessly reproduced in this book.  In addition, the introductory essay describes the history and context of the Small Trades series and its importance to Penn’s career and the history of photography.  An interview with Edmonde Charles-Roux, the chief editor for French Vogue from 1952 to 1966, who assisted Penn on the assignment in Paris, provides fascinating insights of the Paris sittings. ",,,11/06/09,September 9th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Photography', 'Art', 'Nonfiction']",,9780892369966,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349118738l/6858346.jpg,4.4,[],84.0,1.0,,6858346-small-trades,,,,,98.0,45.0,272,,J.

Exploration, sudden wealth, unspeakable hardship, the golden chance to build a new life in a new land - all these are present in this saga of human aspiration.	This book is a colorful gallery of characters: heroes and rascals, adventurers and plodders, men who invaded and tamed or were tamed by what the geographers call the true Far West — California, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. In the cast are Spaniards, Russians, Yankees, Southerners; Sutter, whose dream of an idyllic retreat in the foothills of paradise was shattered by the Gold Rush; John C. Fremont, Mark Twain, Brigham Young, Ralston’s Ring and the Big Four; the Silver Kings, H. A.W. Tabor and Baby Doe, the Rose of Sharon and Eilley Orrum, and scores more. There were the Mormons who tamed the desert with Bible texts, polygamy and co-operation; miners who played wild melodramas in Nevada’s Comstock Lode and Colorado’s awesome Rockies; the tragic Donner Party; gun-toting newspapermen and bankers; and some of the world’s most fascinating women.	There were men who went West to fight, to make millions (or lose them), to die famous, infamous, or unknown; men who built colonies, railroads, cities, financial empires, or dreamed and struggled and failed.

An unexpected accident and the law of succession have just made Douglass Dilman the first black President of the United States.This is the theme of what was surely one of the most provocative novels of the 1960s.

"Irène Némirovsky, Laura Frausin Guarino (Translator)",I doni della vita,,Italian,,"Pierre Hardelot, erede delle omonime cartiere, ha una fidanzata rosea e grassoccia che la famiglia ha scelto per lui, ma è innamorato di un’altra: una che non gli consentiranno mai di sposare, perché appartiene alla piccola borghesia, e non ha dote. Eppure, alla vigilia del matrimonio, Pierre decide di infrangere quella invisibile ma solida barriera «fatta di buon sangue, di carni robuste e sane e di risparmi investiti in titoli di Stato, una barriera destinata a proteggere per sempre i giovani dalle insidie della sorte e dalle loro stesse passioni», e la legge non scritta per la quale di generazione in generazione accoppiamenti giudiziosi stringono sempre di più i legami tra le poche famiglie che contano della ricca borghesia di provincia – e sposa la donna che ama. Comincia così «il grande romanzo classico» di Irène Némirovsky: trenta capitoli in cui, attraverso la storia degli Hardelot, si percorrono trent’anni di storia francese, da quelli che precedettero la prima guerra mondiale a quelli che vedono (nel momento stesso in cui Irène racconta gli eventi mentre stanno accadendo) l’occupazione della Francia da parte dei tedeschi. E qui – nelle pagine conclusive del romanzo, allorché si compiono i destini dei personaggi che ha seguito con il suo sguardo affettuoso e ironico – Irène Némirovsky ci stupisce ancora una volta, dimostrando (esattamente come in Suite francese, la cui stesura portava avanti in parallelo, e di cui I doni della vita si può considerare una sorta di prova generale) una lucidità quasi profetica su quelli che saranno i destini dell’umanità tutta.",,Biblioteca Adelphi #536,11/06/47,March 1st 2009,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'France', 'War', 'World War II', 'World War I', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",,9788845923616,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1326235854l/9652143.jpg,3.9,[],79.0,1.0,,9652143-i-doni-della-vita,,,,,95.0,1948.0,218,,Adelphi,"['474', '907', '478', '72', '17']",,,[],,
"Irène Némirovsky, Laura Frausin Guarino (Translator)",Due,,Italian,,"«Chi meglio della signora Némirovsky, e con un'arma più affilata, ha saputo scrutare l'anima passionale della gioventù del 1920, quel suo frenetico impulso a vivere, quel desiderio ardente e sensuale di bruciarsi nel piacere?» scrisse, all'uscita di questo libro, il critico Pierre Loewel. Le giovani coppie che vediamo amoreggiare in una notte primaverile (la Grande Guerra è finita da pochi mesi, e loro sono i fortunati, quelli che alla carneficina delle trincee sono riusciti a sopravvivere) hanno, apparentemente, un solo desiderio: godere, in una immediatezza senza domani, ignorando «il lato sordido» della vita, soffocando «la paura dell'ombra». Eppure, quasi sulla soglia del romanzo, uno dei protagonisti si pone una domanda - «Come avviene, nel matrimonio, il passaggio dall'amore all'amicizia? Quando si smette di tormentarsi a vicenda e si comincia finalmente a volersi bene?» - che ne costituirà il filo conduttore. Con mano ferma, e con uno sguardo ironicamente compassionevole, Irène Némirovsky accompagna i suoi giovani personaggi, attraverso le intermittenze e le devastazioni della passione, fino alla quieta, un po' ottusa sicurezza dell'amore co niugale. A volte, certo, alcuni di loro rimpiangeranno « l'ebbrezza triste e folle del l'amore», e a quasi tutti accadrà di inoltrarsi, almeno per un po', nelle vie perigliose dell'adulterio; ma il tempo riserverà loro una sorprendente rivelazione: che quell'« essere due» che del matrimonio costituisce l'essenza e «il flusso discontinuo, lento e possente dell'amore coniugale» conferiscono alla coppia una sorta di «invincibilità».",,Biblioteca Adelphi #555,11/06/39,March 1st 2010,"['Marianne Segré Carmontel', 'Antoine Carmontel', 'Evelyne Segré', 'Gilbert Carmontel', 'Solange Saint-Clair Carmontel', 'Pascal Carmontel', 'Albert Carmontel', 'Berthe Carmontel', 'Dominique Hériot']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Romance']",,9788845924729,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1326236622l/9590488.jpg,3.71,[],88.0,1.0,,9590488-due,,,,,92.0,570.0,237,,Adelphi,"['121', '217', '186', '39', '7']",,,['Paris (France)'],,
"Irène Némirovsky, Laura Frausin Guarino (Translator)",Il vino della solitudine,,Italian,,"Il vino della solitudine è il più autobiografico e il più personale dei grandi romanzi di Irène Némirovsky: la quale, pochi giorni prima di essere arrestata, stilando l'elenco delle sue opere sul retro del quaderno di Suite francese, accanto a questo titolo scriveva: «Di Irène Némirovsky per Irène Némirovsky». Non sarà difficile, in effetti, riconoscere nella piccola Hélène, che siede a tavola dritta e composta per evitare gli aspri rimproveri della madre, la stessa Irène; e nella bella donna che a cena sfoglia le riviste di moda appena arrivate da Parigi in quella noiosa cittadina dell'impero russo – che trascura una figlia poco amata per il giovane cugino, oggetto invece di una furente passione – quella Fanny Némirovsky che ha fatto dell'infanzia di Irène un deserto senza amore. Hélène detesta la madre con tutte le sue forze (e si sente morire all'idea di dover posare la bocca su quella guancia che vorrebbe «lacerare con le unghie»), al punto da sostituirne il nome, nelle preghiere serali, con quello dell'amata istitutrice, «con una vaga speranza omicida». Verrà un giorno, però, in cui la madre comincerà a invecchiare, e Hélène avrà diciott'anni: accadrà a Parigi, dove la famiglia si è stabilita dopo la guerra e la rivoluzione di ottobre e la fuga attraverso le vaste pianure gelate della Russia e della Finlandia, durante la quale l'adolescente ha avuto per la prima volta «la consapevolezza del suo potere di donna». Allora sembrerà giunto alfine per lei il momento della vendetta: «Ti farò piangere come tu hai fatto piangere me!». Ma Hélène non è sua madre – e forse sceglierà una strada diversa: quella di una solitudine «aspra e inebriante». Da un'infanzia infelice, diceva Irène Némirovsky, non si guarisce mai: pochi hanno saputo raccontare quell'infelicità come ha fatto lei.",,Biblioteca Adelphi #569,11/05/35,March 23rd 2011,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Russia', 'Womens', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",,9788845925665,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1326240276l/11031259.jpg,3.58,[],77.0,1.0,,11031259-il-vino-della-solitudine,,,,,88.0,1411.0,245,,Adelphi,"['241', '523', '475', '156', '16']",,,[],,
"Irène Némirovsky, Sandra Smith (Translator)",Suite Française,,English,,"The first two stories of a masterwork once thought lost, written by a pre-WWII bestselling author who was deported to Auschwitz and died before her work could be completed.By the early l940s, when Ukrainian-born Irène Némirovsky began working on what would become Suite Française—the first two parts of a planned five-part novel—she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central France—where she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the Nazis—she'd begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read Némirovsky's literary masterpiece The first part, ""A Storm in June,"" opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survival—some trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their lives—but soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know. In the second part, ""Dolce,"" we enter the increasingly complex life of a German-occupied provincial village. Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagers—from aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasants—cope as best they can. Some choose resistance, others collaboration, and as their community is transformed by these acts, the lives of these these men and women reveal nothing less than the very essence of humanity.Suite Française is a singularly piercing evocation—at once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate, and fiercely ironic—of life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art.",,,09/28/04,April 10th 2007,"['Charlotte Péricand', 'Hubert Péricand', 'Philippe Péricand', 'Gabriel Corte', 'Charles Langelet', 'Maurice Michaud', 'Jeanne Michaud', 'Jean-Marie Michaud', 'Madeleine Sabarie']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'France', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Holocaust', 'Book Club', 'Novels']",,9781400096275,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557142046l/43944._SY475_.jpg,3.83,"['Magnesia Litera for Translation (Litera za překladovou knihu) (2012)', 'Prix Renaudot (2004)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Sandra Smith (2007)', 'French-American Foundation Translation Prize for Fiction (2006)', 'Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Nominee (2007)']",3084.0,37.0,,43944.Suite_Fran_aise,,,,,90.0,63320.0,431,,Vintage,"['18005', '24469', '14699', '4481', '1666']",,,[],,

Isaac Asimov,The Robot Novels: The Caves of Steel / The Naked Sun / The Robots of Dawn,,English,,"In The Caves of Steel, Isaac Asimov first introduced Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, who would later become his favorite protagonists.   The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the novel opens. Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador, lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer. Elijah must work with a Spacer partner, a highly advanced robot who is visually identical to a human, named R. Daneel Olivaw, even though Elijah, like many Earth residents, has a low opinion of robots. Together, they search for the murderer and try to avert an interstellar diplomatic incident.  Like its famous predecessor, The Nakes Sun is a whodunit story, in addition to being science fiction. The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent scientist of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth. Elijah Baley is called in to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humaniform robot R. Daneel Olivaw.   The Robots of Dawn is the third novel in Asimov's Robot series. Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw team up to solve the roboticide of a robot identical to Olivaw on the Spacer world of Aurora. The robot's inventor, Han Fastolfe, has been implicated. Fastolfe, who was last seen in The Caves of Steel, is the best roboticist on Aurora. He has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done it, although he denies doing it. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth. Implication in the crime threatens his political career; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated.",Robot #1-3,,10/30/52,August 12th 1988,"['Elijah Baley', 'R.

A superorganism, Gaia is a holistic planet with a common consciousness so intensely united that every dewdrop, every pebble, every being, can speak for all—and feel for all. It is a realm in which privacy is not only undesirable, it is incomprehensible. But is it the right choice for the destiny of mankind? While Trevize feels it is, that is not enough. He must know. Trevize believes the answer lies at the site of humanity's roots: fabled Earth . . . if it still exists. For no one is sure where the planet of Gaia's first settlers is to be found in the immense wilderness of the Galaxy. Nor can anyone explain why no record of Earth has been preserved, no mention of it made anywhere in Gaia's vast world-memory.

Isaac Asimov,"The Foundation Novels 7-Book Bundle: Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation",,English,,"The story of our future begins with the Foundation. Named the best series of all time by the Hugo Awards, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov unquestionably comprise one of the great masterworks of science fiction, unsurpassed for its unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building. Now, all seven volumes are together for the first time in this essential eBook bundle:   FOUNDATION FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE SECOND FOUNDATION FOUNDATION’S EDGE FOUNDATION AND EARTH PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION FORWARD THE FOUNDATION   For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future—a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire—both scientists and scholars—and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation.   But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. And mankind’s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves—or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction.   Praise for Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series   “A true polymath, a superb rationalist, an exciting and accessible writer in both fiction and nonfiction, Isaac Asimov was simply a master of all he surveyed.”—Greg Bear   “Asimov served wondrous meals-of-the-mind to a civilization that was starved for clear thinking about the future. To this day, his visions spice our ongoing dinner-table conversation about human destiny.”—David Brin   “Isaac was still in his teens when I met him, a fan of mine before I was a fan of his. Writing for John W. Campbell back in the famous ‘golden age of science fiction,’ he became one of the founders of our field. With the Robot stories and the Foundation stories, he helped to shape science fiction as we know it.”—Jack Williamson   “I grew up on the ABC’s of science fiction—Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke. There’s a reason Asimov’s name comes first, and not just because of the alphabet!”—Janis Ian   “With his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.”—Kevin J. Anderson   “If anything can be said to have been the launch pad for space-age science fiction, it has to be the Foundation trilogy. It’s a classic. And it’s unforgettable.”—Jack McDevitt   “The Foundation series is one of the masterpieces of science fiction. If you’ve never read these novels, then you’re in for a treat, and even if you’ve already read them, then you owe it to yourself to reread them, because they’re still great.”—Allen Steele   “Quite simply, Asimov got me started.”—Liz Williams",Foundation (Publication Order) #1-7,,,August 5th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction']",,B00JOESE06,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408602348l/23005036.jpg,4.59,[],97.0,1.0,,23005036-the-foundation-novels-7-book-bundle,,,,,99.0,325.0,,,Spectra,"['224', '73', '25', '1', '2']",,,[],,

"Isaac Newton, I.

Even after more than three centuries and the revolutions of Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics continues to account for many of the phenomena of the observed world, and Newtonian celestial dynamics is used to determine the orbits of our space vehicles.This completely new translation, the first in 270 years, is based on the third (1726) edition, the final revised version approved by Newton; it includes extracts from the earlier editions, corrects errors found in earlier versions, and replaces archaic English with contemporary prose and up-to-date mathematical forms. Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself, the Principia also revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation. It set forth the fundamental three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity, the physical principles that account for the Copernican system of the world as emended by Kepler, thus effectively ending controversy concerning the Copernican planetary system.The illuminating Guide to the Principia by I.

Isabel Allende (Goodreads Author),My Invented Country: A Nostalgic Journey Through Chile,,English,,"Isabel Allende's first memory of Chile is of a house she never knew. The ""large old house"" on the Calle Cueto, where her mother was born and which her grandfather evoked so frequently that Isabel felt as if she had lived there, became the protagonist of her first novel, The House of the Spirits. It appears again at the beginning of Allende's playful, seductively compelling memoir My Invented Country, and leads us into this gifted writer's world.Here are the almost mythic figures of a Chilean family -- grandparents and great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends -- with whom readers of Allende's fiction will feel immediately at home. And here, too, is an unforgettable portrait of a charming, idiosyncratic Chilean people with a violent history and an indomitable spirit. Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- ""I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me"" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland. In My Invented County, she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.Two life-altering events inflect the peripatetic narration of this book: The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on her newly adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author's past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants, and to all of us, who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.",,,01/06/03,May 27th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Spanish Literature', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Latin American', 'Autobiography', 'Womens']",,9780060545642,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405046012l/16528.jpg,3.86,[],80.0,1.0,,16528.My_Invented_Country,,,,,93.0,7826.0,199,,Harper,"['2117', '3125', '2022', '460', '102']",,,[],,

Eva is a naturally gifted and imaginative storyteller who meets people from all stations and walks of life. Though she has no wealth, she trades her stories like currency with people who are kind to her. In this novel, she shares the story of her own life and introduces readers to a diverse and eccentric cast of characters including the Lebanese émigré who befriends her and takes her in; her unfortunate godmother, whose brain is addled by rum and who believes in all the Catholic saints and a few of her own invention; a street urchin who grows into a petty criminal and, later, a leader in the guerrilla struggle; a celebrated transsexual entertainer who instructs her in the ways of the adult world; and a young refugee whose flight from postwar Europe will prove crucial to Eva's fate.As Eva tells her story, Isabel Allende conjures up a whole complex South American nation—the rich, the poor, the simple, and the sophisticated—in a novel replete with character and incident, with drama and comedy and history, with battles and passions, rebellions and reunions, a novel that celebrates the power of imagination to create a better world.",,,10/28/87,August 1st 1989,"['Eva Luna', 'Huberto Naranjo', 'Consuelo', 'Riad Hilabi', 'El Negro', 'La Señora', 'Melesio/Mimi', 'Zulema', 'Rolf Carlé']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Historical Fiction', 'Spanish Literature', 'Classics', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780553280586,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478631242l/149196._SY475_.jpg,3.97,['American Book Award (1989)'],3009.0,47.0,,149196.Eva_Luna,,,,,95.0,40130.0,307,,Bantam,"['12487', '16422', '9262', '1629', '330']",,,['Chile'],,

Though her childhood is one of brutality and fear, Tété finds solace in the traditional rhythms of African drums and in the voodoo loas she discovers through her fellow slaves.  When twenty-year-old Toulouse Valmorain arrives on the island in 1770, it’s with powdered wigs in his baggage and dreams of financial success in his mind. But running his father’s plantation, Saint-Lazare, is neither glamorous nor easy. It will be eight years before he brings home a bride -- but marriage, too, proves more difficult than he imagined. And Valmorain remains dependent on the services of his teenaged slave. Spanning four decades, Island Beneath the Sea is the moving story of the intertwined lives of Tété and Valmorain, and of one woman’s determination to find love amid loss, to offer humanity though her own has been battered, and to forge her own identity in the cruellest of circumstances.Translated from the Spanish by Margaret Sayers Peden.",,,08/25/09,April 27th 2010,"['Jean Lafitte', 'Zarité Sedella', 'Toulouse Valmorain', 'Violette Boisier', 'Sancho García del Solar', 'Maurice Valmorain', 'Rosette Sedella', 'Tante Rose', 'Dr. Parmentier', 'Loula']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Spanish Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780061988240,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501991943l/7005479.jpg,4.06,[],191.0,2.0,,7005479-island-beneath-the-sea,,,,,95.0,33170.0,457,,Harper,"['11569', '13825', '6217', '1260', '299']",,,['Saint-Domingue (Haiti)'],,

E a ideia de deixar Portugal, o pai envelhecido, os cinco irmãos em constante desacordo, e Lopo, irmão de leite e melhor amigo, para partir para um país longínquo e gelado atormentava-lhe o coração.

Isabel Wilkerson (Goodreads Author),The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration,,English,,"In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an “unrecognized immigration” within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.",,1st,,September 7th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'American History', 'African American', 'Anti Racist', 'Social Justice', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Audiobook']",,9780679444329,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433354252l/8171378._SY475_.jpg,4.39,"['Mark Lynton History Prize (2011)', 'Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Non-Fiction (2011)', 'PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction Nominee (2011)', 'Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2011)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction (2010)', 'Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)']",398.0,6.0,,8171378-the-warmth-of-other-suns,,,,,96.0,59760.0,622,,Random House,"['34962', '16812', '5495', '1588', '903']",,,[],,

Isabella Santacroce,Lulù Delacroix,,Italian,,"A Perfect City, dove tutto è ordine, armonia e bellezza, regole severe proibiscono ogni imperfezione. Nulla turba la vita senza difetti dei suoi abitanti. Per questo mondo di fiaba artefatta, terrorizzato da ogni forma di diversità, la piccola Lulù Delacroix rappresenta una minaccia. Di più, un’offesa inaudita. Perché Lulù non è una bambina come tutte le altre: non ha i capelli, ha due occhi enormi, una pelle bianchissima e uno strano modo di esprimersi. Nessuno l’accetta, neppure i genitori che per lei non conoscono dolcezza, tantomeno le sue sorelle Ada e Dolores che si divertono a tormentarla con giochi crudeli. Per questo la decisione è drastica: quella ragazzina è un mostro, spaventa le persone, non dovrà mai uscire di casa. Così Lulù si crea un universo privato per sopravvivere alla realtà che la rifiuta, fino a quando l’incontro con Mimì, una bambola con un braccio e un occhio solo, nel giorno del suo sesto compleanno la trascinerà nella più grande avventura della sua vita. Insieme dovranno raggiungere il Mondo del Mistero e, tra mille incontri e fantastiche acrobazie, sconfiggere i pregiudizi, origine di ogni infelicità.

Isamu Fukui,Truancy,,English,,"
  
    In an alternate world, in a nameless totalitarian city, the autocratic Mayor rules the school system with an iron fist, with the help of his Educators. Fighting against the Mayor and his repressive Educators is a group of former students called the Truancy, whose goal is to take down the system by any means possibleâ€”at any cost. 
    Against this backdrop, fifteen-year-old Tack is just trying to survive. His days are filled with sadistic teachers, unrelenting schoolwork, and indifferent parents. Things start to look up when he meets Umasi, a mysterious boy who runs a lemonade stand in an uninhabited district. 
    Then someone close to Tack gets killed in the crossfire between the Educators and the Truants, and Tack swears vengeance. To achieve his purpose, he abandons his old life and joins the Truancy. There, he confronts Zyid, an enigmatic leader with his own plans for Tack. But Tack soon finds himself torn between his desire for vengeance and his growing sympathy for the Truantsâ€¦. 
    Isamu Fukui wrote Truancy during the summer of his fifteenth year. The authorâ€™s purpose is not just to entertain, but to make a statement about the futility of the endless cycle of violence in the world as well as the state of the educational system. And, as he put it, â€œI need to be in school myself if I want to write about it.â€

Israel J. Singer,The Brothers Ashkenazi,,English,,"In the Polish city of Lodz, the brothers Ashkenazi grew up very differently in talent and in temperament. Max, the firstborn, is fiercely intelligent and conniving, determined to succeed financially by any means necessary. Slower-witted Jacob is strong, handsome, and charming but without great purpose in life. While Max is driven by ambition and greed to be more successful than his brother, Jacob is drawn to easy living and decadence. As waves of industrialism and capitalism flood the city, the brothers and their families are torn apart by the clashing impulses of old piety and new skepticism, traditional ways and burgeoning appetites, and the hatred that grows between faiths, citizens, and classes. Despite all attempts to control their destinies, the brothers are caught up by forces of history, love, and fate, which shape and, ultimately, break them.   First published in 1936, The Brothers Ashkenazi quickly became a best seller as a sprawling family saga. Breaking away from the introspective shtetl tales of classic nineteenth-century writers, I. J. Singer brought to Yiddish literature the multilayered plots, large casts of characters, and narrative sweep of the traditional European novel. Walking alongside such masters as Zola, Flaubert, and Tolstoy, I . J. Singer’s premodernist social novel stands as a masterpiece of storytelling.",,,11/06/36,,"['Simcha Meyer (Max) Ashkenazi', 'Jacob Bunim (Yacob) Ashkenazi', 'Dinah Ashkenazi', 'Abraham Hirsch Ashkenazi', 'Nissan Noske', 'Gertrude Ashkenazi', 'Ignatz Ashkenazi', 'Tevyeh', 'Heinz Huntze', 'Chaim Alter', 'Priveh Alter']",Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Jewish', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Poland', 'Novels', 'Judaism', 'Judaica', 'Literary Fiction', 'Religion']",,9780140187779,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394244674l/11210833.jpg,4.32,[],79.0,1.0,,11210833-the-brothers-ashkenazi,,,,,97.0,985.0,462,,,"['489', '347', '124', '23', '2']",,,['Lodz (Poland)'],,

Taste, hearing, and smell. Amid the flavors of Mexico’s fiery chilies and spices, a couple on holiday discovers dark truths about the maturing of desire in the title story, “Under the Jaguar Sun.” In “A King Listens,” a gripping portrait of a frenzied mind, the menacing echoes in a huge palace spur a tyrant’s thoughts to the heights of paranoid intensity. “The Name, the Nose” drives to a startling conclusion as men across time and space pursue the women whose aromas have enchanted them.

"Italo Calvino, William Weaver (Translator)",If on a Winter's Night a Traveler,,English,,"If on a Winter's Night a Traveler is a marvel of ingenuity, an experimental text that looks longingly back to the great age of narration—""when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded."" Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists, the Reader and the Other Reader, ultimately end up married, having almost finished If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: ""Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade."" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next.The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches—stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition—with explorations of how and why we choose to read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. If on a Winter's Night is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. ""What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.""",,,10/28/79,10/20/82,"['The reader', 'Ludmilla Vipiteno', 'Lotaria Vipiteno', 'Ermes Marana', 'Silas Flannery', 'Irnerio']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Italy', 'Novels', 'Books About Books', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",,9780088619451,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312857l/374233._SY475_.jpg,4.05,"['Ars Translationis (2010)', 'Ein Buch für die Stadt (2004)']",12620.0,153.0,,374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler,,,,,92.0,74688.0,260,,L&OD Key Porter,"['30665', '25049', '12781', '4226', '1967']",,,[],,

Here are Zeno’s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpected–and unexpectedly happy–marriage to Ada’s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer.

Con suo sommo sgomento, però, scopre che l'appartamento è completamente vuoto. Niente televisore, lavatrice, frigorifero, mobili, tende, niente di niente. Spariti persino gli utensili in cucina, il mortaio di epoca Meiji ereditato dalla nonna materna, la casseruola Le Creuset acquistata con la paga del suo primo impiego, il coltello italiano ricevuto in occasione del suo ventesimo compleanno. E, soprattutto, sparito il fidanzato indiano, maître nel ristorante accanto al suo, un ragazzo con la pelle profumata di spezie.Lo choc di Ringo è tale che resta impietrita al centro della casa desolatamente vuota, la voce che non le esce più dalla bocca. Decide allora di ritornare al villaggio natio, dove non mette più piede da quando, quindicenne, è scappata di casa in un giorno di primavera.Là, appartata nella quiete dei monti, matura il suo dolore. Una mattina, però, osservando il granaio della casa materna, Ringo ha un'idea singolare per tornare pienamente alla vita: aprire un ristorante per non più di una coppia al giorno, con un menu ad hoc, ritagliato sulla fisionomia e i possibili desideri dei clienti.Con l'aiuto del valente Kuma-san, l'ex factotum della scuola elementare del villaggio, il cui cuore è stato infranto dalla bella Shiñorita, un'argentina scappata in città, Ringo risistema il granaio. Pareti tinteggiate d'arancio, posate di epoca vittoriana e di epoca Taish e, nel giro di qualche mese, il Lumachino, così la ragazza battezza il ristorante, apre i battenti.La prima cliente è la Concubina, la triste amante di un influente politico locale, passato a miglior vita diversi anni prima. Sulla tavola, in un tripudio di colori, odori e bontà senza pari, si alternano piatti gustosissimi che attingono alle cucine più famose: giapponese, italiana, cinese e francese su tutte. L'indomani, la Concubina, agghindata di solito a lutto con una lunga veste nera, passeggia con un cappotto rosso fuoco e un magnifico colbacco di pelliccia, e il suo atteggiamento schivo ha lasciato spazio a una marcata allegria. La medesima cosa accade a tutti i clienti del Lumachino: una ragazza riesce a fare innamorare di sé l'ex compagno di classe che l'aveva sempre ignorata, una coppia gay in fuga d'amore tra i monti trasforma il soggiorno in una luna di miele, un uomo burbero e scorbutico diventa un gentiluomo e così via. In breve, la notizia della magia del Lumachino si diffonde in tutto il circondario, e il successo è così garantito, poiché tutti vogliono sedersi alla tavola del ristorante dell'amore ritrovato.",,Le tavole d'oro,01/30/08,May 27th 2010,[],Paperback,"['Japan', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Food', 'Roman', 'Asia', 'Contemporary', 'Asian Literature', 'Novels', 'Italian Literature']",,9788854504196,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347567141l/9667161.jpg,3.51,['Premio Bancarella della Cucina (2011)'],98.0,1.0,,9667161-il-ristorante-dell-amore-ritrovato,,,,,84.0,1314.0,191,,Neri Pozza,"['251', '429', '425', '158', '51']",,,[],,

What better place to have an impenetrable base than deep within the oceans of the planet? Yet, if UFOs, or at least some of them, are coming from beneath our oceans or lakes, does it necessarily mean that there is another civilization besides our own that is responsible? In fact, could it be that since WWII a number of underwater UFO bases have been constructed by the very human governments of our planet?

"Ivan Vazov, Иван Вазов",Под игото,,Bulgarian,,"„Под игото“ е първият български роман. Подзаглавие - „Из живота на българина в навечерието на Освобождението“.Написан е от Иван Вазов по време на изгнание в Одеса, пренесен е в България с руската дипломатическа поща. Композиционно романът се състои от три части и 88 глави, които обхващат подготовката, избухването и потушаването на Априлското въстание. Сюжетното действие започва с идването на Бойчо Огнянов в Бяла Черква през май 1875 г. и завършва с неговата смърт през май 1876 г. Но фабулата на творбата не се изчерпва с личните драми на героите, нито с действията и противодействията им през тази година, защото не личните, а историческите събития са в основата на сюжетното действие и определят неговия епически характер. Своеобразна кулминация и развръзка на романа са главите ""Пиянството на един народ"" и ""Пробуждане"", в които Вазов постига редки за българската литература прозрения по философия на българската история с резките й преходи от опиянение към отрезвяване и страх, от подем към покруса, разочарование и предателство.Романът ""Под игото"" е първата книга, която носи литературна слава на Вазов и на България.

Ivan de Monbrison,Inside The Fire: A Tale of the Insane,,,,"The story takes place in Marseilles. Marseilles is a poor city in the South of France. It is a gate to Europe coming through the sea from North Africa. It was created more than 2000 years ago by Greek settlers coming from the town of Phocea, now on the Turkish coast.Marseilles is today famous in Europe as a city of corruption and violence.In this city was born an insane poet Antonin Artaud who wrote amazing books in the first part of the XXth century and is studied everywhere nowadays. However Artaud went mad and spent about ten years in an asylum in the last part of his life, all through WWII. Treated through intensive electroshock, he remained toothless after that.Artaud is being referenced in the book by the nickname that his mother gave him as a child “Nanaqui,” which is also the one he uses in his own writing.In this tale, Nanaqui comes back from the dead to visit us, with his companion Ivan (the Narrator). He is as obscene, crude, maniac, and delirious as a living dead could be. He meets a witch, Sarah, who drops by Marseilles on the way to the film festival of Cannes. Nanaqui wants to have an affair with her, but it turns out that she prefers a penguin to him (the penguin turns out to be gay actually).The story could be read as a modern tale taking place in the blazing heat of Marseilles, by the Mediterranean Sea, a shore haunted by hundreds of years of decaying civilizations, and through Nanaqui, our hero by the spirit of both greatness and madness.Warning: This book contains adult content, minimal punctuation, explicit language and is not suited for those below 18 years.+",,,,June 30th 2018,[],ebook,[],,9780463378656,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529668337l/40384576._SY475_.jpg,0.0,[],97.0,1.0,,40384576-inside-the-fire,,,,,,0.0,,,Avid Publishing LLC,[],,,[],,

The collection is considered her masterpiece and it features a series of newly written fairy tales heavily inspired by motifs taken from ancient Slavic mythology of pre-Christian Croatia.Croatian Tales of Long Ago are seen as one of the most typical examples of her writing style which has been compared by literary critics to Hans Christian Andersen and J.

Visegrad has long been a bone of contention between the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, but the bridge survives unscathed until 1914, when the collision of forces in the Balkans triggers the outbreak of World War I. The bridge spans generations, nationalities and creeds, silent testament to the lives played out on it.

Ivo Andrić,"Ex Ponto, Nemiri, Lirika",,Serbian,,"=From the Sea, Riots, LyricsAndrić’s first published works were poems and he continued to write verse intermittenly all his life, altho much of it was unpublished until his death. His 1st poems appeared in the context of the Young Bosnia movement. The writing of its members is in marked contrast to their robust active personalities. The poems Andrić published before WWI are virtually indistinguishable in tone from much of what his contemporaries were writing. Nevertheless, it's probably true to say that in his case the role of the political activist, however sincerely he played it at the time, was fundamentally unsuited to him. By contrast, however, the prevailing melancholy seemed to match his temperamental reponse to the world. These early poems point in no particular direction, beyond establishing the free verse form of virtually all of Andrić’s poetry and a tendency to a mournful self-pity which sometimes threatens his personal statements. The prose poems written during the War represent a personal conffesion & cannot be considered merely the reflection of a literary vogue. “Ex Ponto” (refers to Ovid’s account of his Black Sea exile) was published in 1918; “Unrest” in 1920, when “Ex Ponto” was already reprinted. Thereafter Andrić refused to allow them to be included in any of his collections of his works published before his death. He rejected them because they seemed to him too intimate. But, they're important since they contain ideas & themes which recur in his later works. The strong emotional colouring was toned down in Andrić’s later prose poems & verse but their form, a combination of aphoristic statements & longer reflective passages, continued to appeal to him. “Ex Ponto” & “Unrest” record his emotional reaction to the circumstances of his early life & the development of a number of themes around the central paradox of his personality & work.",,,11/05/20,Published,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Serbian Literature']",,9788607010646,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328024621l/2230670.jpg,4.45,[],77.0,1.0,,2230670.Ex_Ponto_Nemiri_Lirika,,,,,97.0,615.0,276,,Prosveta,"['376', '160', '63', '12', '4']",,,[],,
Ivo Andrić,Prokleta avlija,,,,"Prokleta avlija/The Damned Yard (Description from Ivo Andrić Foundation website)The novel is written in 1954. Ćamil, a wealthy young man of Smyrna living in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, is fascinated by the story of Džem, ill-fated brother of the Sultan Bajazet, who ruled Turkey in the fifteenth century. Ćamil, in his isolation, comes to believe that he is Džem, and that he shares his evil destiny: he is born to be a victim of the State. Because of his stories about Džem’s ambitions to overthrow his brother, Ćamil is arrested under suspicion of plotting against the Sultan. He is taken to a prison in Istanbul, where he tells his story, to Petar, a monk.Out of these exotic materials, Andrić has constructed a book of great clarity, brevity and interest. No doubt it will be read by some as a political parable about the tyranny of the State, but also as a quite simply story about ill-fortune and human misunderstanding, fear and ignorance. Džem and Ćamil are doomed – and the certainty of their persecution is sometimes relieved, sometimes intensified by the stupidity and fright of the people who cross their ill-starred lives.Construction takes up most of the book’s space: the central story of Džem as related by Ćamil lasts only a chapter or two. For the rest of the time the reader strips layer off layer, as one narrator passes him on the next. There is an interesting passage that helps to explain this method, at the moment when Ćamil starts narrating Džem’s story in the first person. “I” is a word, we are told, which fixes the position of the speaker in such a way that the exercise of will is no longer possible, and the speaker strength is exceeded – strength, presumably, to break out of the identification that all his past actions and thoughts force upon him when he uses the word. “I” is both a confession and an imprisonment. The fact that the novel passes the reader on from one narrator to the next rather suggests that the author is taking constant evasive action, lest he betray himself or his reader into the kind of “personal confession” which seals the fate of Ćamil. What exactly this game of form flirting with meaning signifies, must be left to the individual reader.The movement is centripetal, towards Džem’s story, and then disperses. Details within the story are made to mimic this form. Thus when Peter receives the message telling him of his impending release:“Two younger prisoners...were chasing around using him as the centerpoint of ever narrowing circles. Annoyed, he tried to break away from these exuberant youths when one of them brushed against him and he felt a folded scrap of paper thrust into his hand. The youths continued their chase but now in widening circles...”The reader is led on just such a chase in the course of the novel. The effect of this is to make the plot seem more like a poetic image than an ordinary plot: capable, therefore, of as many meanings as are the images of an allusive poem. Yet the language is simple and direct, not at all “poetic”. The characters are remarkable alive, even in conversation. Karađoz, the governor of the goal, is a spidery authoritarian, who loves to torment the charges he loves. The prisoners “complained about the way one complains about one’s life and curses one’s destiny...it would have been hard for them to imagine life without him”.“The Devil’s Yard” is justified, as all symbolic and figurative novels must be, by the extent to which it touches the emotions. It is extremely moving. Fear, horror, despair, amusement at times – all these indicate that the threat of the meaning has been recognized.",,,10/28/54,,[],Hardcover,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Serbian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Read For School']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452219308l/11553583.jpg,4.3,[],528.0,6.0,,11553583-prokleta-avlija,,,,,96.0,7123.0,120,,,"['3646', '2265', '962', '209', '41']",,,[],,
Ivo Andrić,Anika,,Polish,,"Among the stories published between the wars there are several characters who dominate the tales in which they appear and seem similarly to stand for a whole category of human experience. An example is the heroine of the of the story “Anika's Times“(1931). Anika is a woman who wreaks havoc in Višegrad through the unpredictable distribution of her favours. The impact she made is still spoken of when the story opens, several generations later. Anika is a self-willed creature whose defiance of convention – flouted initially out of pique with a particular young man – predictably brings her no happiness to the extent that she welcomes the prospect of the inevitable retribution her as a relief for herself and others: “It would be an act of charity of someone would kill me”, she repeats several times before her death. In this way Anika herself is not entirely in control of her destiny, but is the vehicle of an overwhelming power over men. The story of Anika is given an additional dimension in the form of an explanatory introduction the exact meaning of which is perhaps not immediately clear, but emerges from the account of “Anika’s Times”. This introduction describes the growing schizophrenia of the parish priest of a village outside Višegrad and his obsessive, furtive watching of women. As long as the villagers speak of him they tend to be reminded also of Anika. There is only a tenuous connection between her and father Vujadin, so that the association of the two stories in the villagers’ minds seems to suggest a more profound link. Vujadin’s madness is not directly attributable to his experience of women; he has become cut off from his fellow-men by a variety of factors. But as he steadily loses touch with society, women seem to loom ever larger in his consciousness. In this aspect of his madness that seems to disturb the villagers and urge them to give it form in their recollection of the legend of Anika. Within the framework of the story “Anika's Times“, this introduction appears as a kind of meditation on man's perennial need to control and account for his powerful response to woman, the need which led to the creation of the legend of Adam and Eve.",,,10/30/31,1978,[],Hardcover,"['Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1259775870l/7227391.jpg,4.19,[],96.0,1.0,,7227391-anika,,,,,95.0,288.0,122,,Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy,"['124', '111', '38', '14', '1']",,,[],,
"Ivo Andrić, Joseph Hitrec (translator)",Bosnian Chronicle,,English,,"Set in the town of Travnik, Bosnian Chronicle presents the struggle for supremacy in a region that stubbornly refuses to submit to any outsider. The era is Napoleanic and the novel, both in its historical scope and psychological subtley, Tolstoyan. In its portray of conflict and fierce ethnic loyalties, the story is also eerily relevant. Ottoman viziers, French consuls, and Austrian plenipotentiaries are consumed by an endless game of diplomacy and double-dealing: expansive and courtly face-to-face, brooding and scheming behind closed doors.

Ivo Andríc,The Bridge on the Drina,,,Fiction,"The Bridge on the Drina is a vivid depiction of the suffering history has imposed upon the people of Bosnia from the late 16th century to the beginning of World War I. As we seek to make sense of the current nightmare in this region, this remarkable, timely book serves as a reliable guide to its people and history. ""No better introduction to the study of Balkan and Ottoman history exists, nor do I know of any work of fiction that more persuasively introduces the reader to a civilization other than our own. It is an intellectual and emotional adventure to encounter the Ottoman world through Andric's pages in its grandiose beginning and at its tottering finale. It is, in short, a marvelous work, a masterpiece, and very much sui generis. . . . Andric's sensitive portrait of social change in distant Bosnia has revelatory force.""—William H.

"Iwan Santosa, E.A. Natanegara",Kopassus untuk Indonesia,,Indonesian,,"Menyamar Pedagang Durian hingga Sniper AmbonIsi buku Kopassus untuk Indonesia yang diluncurkan Kopassus TNI-AD tak sembarangan. Buku dengan desain gaul itu membuka rahasia dapur korps terbaik ketiga di dunia itu, termasuk operasi intelijen bawah tanah. Seperti apa?RIDLWAN HABIB, JakartaWANITA itu bukan tentara. Gaya pakaiannya juga santai. Turun dari mobil New Honda City metalik, dia disambut hormat oleh prajurit Kopassus. “Mbak Esti ini sudah kami anggap bagian dari keluarga,” kata Letkol Farid Makruf yang menyambut Esti di Markas Komando Kopassus, Cijantung, Jakarta Timur Kamis lalu (7/1).Siang itu suasana sekitar Kesatrian Kopassus agak lengang. Sebab, pada jam dinas, semua prajurit sibuk dengan tugas masing-masing. “Sebelum mengenal mereka, saya benar-benar awam dengan dunia militer,” kata Esti yang sengaja berkunjung ke Kopassus untuk menemui Jawa Pos.Nama lengkapnya Erastiani Asikin Natanegara. Bersama penulis lain, Iwan Santosa, mereka diberi kepercayaan penuh oleh Komandan Jenderal (Danjen) Kopassus untuk menulis buku yang mulai beredar tiga minggu lalu itu.“Buku ini adalah buku resmi Kopassus pertama yang ditulis sipil dan untuk umum,” kata Letkol Farid yang ikut berbincang. Farid adalah alumnus Akmil 1991 yang juga menjadi salah satu narasumber buku. Mantan kepala staf pribadi (Kaspri) Danjen Kopassus itu juga menjadi anggota tim penyusun buku bersama 16 orang lainnya.Menurut Farid, Kopassus sengaja meminta orang luar agar tulisannya objektif. “Mbak Esti ini mulai nul puthul. Kita memang buka apa adanya. Kalau mau ditulis jelek, ya tulis saja,” kata perwira asal Pulau Madura itu.Isi buku setebal 345 halaman itu memang blak-blakan. Misalnya, cerita seorang anggota Sandhi Yudha Kopassus yang bertugas sebagai intelijen Kopassus saat masa darurat militer di Aceh pada 2003. Sersan Badri (nama samaran, Red) bertugas untuk masuk ke lingkaran utama Gerakan Aceh Merdeka.Untuk menyukseskan misinya, Badri harus menyamar sebagai pedagang durian dari Medan. Berselang setahun, sendirian, Badri menembus akses untuk mendapat kepercayaan anggota GAM. “Saat paling sulit, saat dia diminta pimpinan GAM melindungi istrinya dari kejaran pasukan TNI. Selama tiga bulan, Badri harus mencari tempat kos yang aman dari kejaran TNI yang sebenarnya temannya sendiri,” katanya.Agar jaringan intelijen sempurna dan tidak bocor, Badri tidak pernah diketahui identitasnya sebagai anggota Kopassus kecuali oleh beberapa pimpinan operasi. Meski menyamar sebagai pedagang durian, Badri menggunakan kesempatan itu untuk menyabot senjata-senjata GAM. “Misalnya, alat pembidik pada senapan-senapan GAM sengaja digeser agar tembakan mereka melenceng atau tidak tepat sasaran,” katanya.Kisah lain yang juga sengaja dibuka Kopassus adalah tim Kopassus yang bertugas mengamankan kerusuhan Ambon pada Januari 2001. Mereka bertugas di tengah-tengah kelompok Merah (Nasrani) dan kelompok Putih (muslim). Namun, ternyata, sumber kerusuhan adalah sniper (penembak jitu) gelap yang memprovokasi serangan.Narasumber dalam kisah itu adalah Wakil Asisten Intelijen Kopassus Letkol Nyoman Cantiasa yang saat itu masih berpangkat kapten. Kebetulan Nyoman pernah menceritakan kisahnya secara singkat kepada Jawa Pos beberapa bulan lalu saat tak sengaja bertemu di Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata.Dalam buku itu, dikisahkan bahwa Nyoman memerintahkan beberapa anggota tim untuk mencari asal sniper yang menembak di malam hari. Ternyata, para perusuh itu bersembunyi di Hotel Wijaya II Ambon. Mereka juga menyadap saluran HT pasukan Nyoman. Bahkan, kata sandi Nyoman saat itu yakni Arjuna 2 juga diketahui.Berdasar penghitungan matang, Nyoman akhirnya memerintahkan tim dengan seizin Pangdam Pattimura (saat itu dijabat Mayjen M. Yasa) menyerbu Hotel Wijaya. Terjadi baku tembak selama dua jam sebelum seluruh sniper dilumpuhkan. Mereka berhasil menyita beragam senjata, seperti AK 101, AK 102, SKS, MK1, SS1 , M16, dan US Karabine 30 mm.Selain Aceh dan Ambon, Kopassus membuka kisah di balik operasi-operasi di Papua, Timor Leste (dulu Timor Timur), dan berbagai lokasi lain di Indonesia. Tidak khawatir strategi Kopassus bocor ke tangan intelijen asing? Menurut Farid, kekhawatiran selalu ada. “Tapi, ibarat memasak nasi goreng. Bumbunya tidak semua orang tahu, tapi hasilnya enak. Jadi, secara detail teknisnya masih kami tutupi,” kata Farid yang sekarang menjabat kepala penerangan Kopassus itu.Tanpa bermaksud sombong, kata Farid, Kopassus mempunyai kemampuan intelijen dan antiteror yang bisa diandalkan. “Rata-rata pembebasan sandera hanya butuh tiga menit. Di Woyla dulu juga cukup tiga menit,” katanya.Saat ditanya tentang operasi Densus 88 di Temanggung yang butuh waktu 17 jam untuk meringkus Ibrohim, otak peledakan Ritz-Carlton, Farid menggeleng. “Kami tidak mau mengomentari keahlian orang lain. Cukuplah masyarakat yang menilai dengan buku. Kalau memang Kopassus jelek, ya, silakan dianggap jelek. Apa pun itu kami bangga bertugas demi negara. Itu kehormatan komando,” kata perwira yang pernah dikirim ke Sierra Leone, Afrika, itu.Masih banyak kisah lain yang ditulis Esti. Misalnya, proses perekrutan anggota Kopassus yang ketat. Seorang prajurit yang bisa diterima Kopassus harus bisa berlari 12 menit dengan jarak tempuh minimal 2.800 meter. Lalu pull up 12 kali, push up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, sit up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, renang dasar 50 meter dan tidak takut ketinggian lebih dari 15 meter.Setelah itu mereka harus ikut seleksi psikologi dan jika lolos harus menjalani pendidikan komando selama tujuh bulan. Pelatihan itu sangat berat. “Mereka punya istilah kaki tomat, yakni kaki yang melepuh karena harus long march dari Bandung ke Cilacap jalan kaki dengan jarak tempuh 500 kilometer selama 10 hari dengan beban perorangan 30 kg di pundak,” kata Esti.Kisah-kisah kegalakan pelatih juga dideskripsikan. Misalnya, galaknya Kapten Encun di Pusat Pendidikan Kopassus Batujajar. Encun yang ahli melempar pisau komando itu sudah melatih spesialisasi komando 26 tahun. “Semua pohon randu di Batujajar tidak ada yang selamat. Semua dibabat habis untuk latihan lempar pisau,” katanya.Kisah-kisah humanis anggota Kopassus saat bertugas di luar negeri juga dideskripsikan. Juga saat korps baret merah itu menjadi garda depan penanggulangan bencana alam. Wanita alumnus Sastra Tiongkok, Universitas Indonesia itu mengaku hanya butuh tiga minggu untuk menyelesaikan bukunya.“Sehari saya wawancara delapan hingga 10 prajurit, mulai pangkat terbawah sampai jenderal,” katanya. Interaksi tiga minggu itu telah mengubah pandangannya tentang Kopassus. “Mereka orang-orang aneh yang mengidap adrenalin junkie, yakni orang yang bekerja sangat prima dalam kondisi stres dan dalam tekanan tinggi,” katanya.Dia mencontohkan salah seorang bintara bernama Serka Sumardi. Orang itu istimewa karena sudah 14 kali ditugaskan di medan operasi. Sedangkan rata-rata prajurit yang lain hanya empat kali. Sumardi pernah sekali ditugaskan sebagai anggota pasukan PBB di Bosnia.“Saat saya tanya apa yang paling enak dalam penugasan, dia menjawab saat dikirim ke Bosnia karena bisa merasakan enaknya landing (mendarat). Ternyata selama 14 kali terjun operasi, dia selalu dilempar ke udara dengan parasut dan belum pernah sekalipun naik pesawat. Ini ndeso, tapi jujur,” kata Esti sambil melirik Farid.Farid tertawa lepas. “Kisah-kisah seperti itu kami harap bisa menarik minat anak muda bergabung ke Kopassus. Kalau yang tua-tua, terus terang, kami capek meyakinkan mereka,” katanya.

A Harvard-trained Palestinian doctor who was born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and ""who has devoted his life to medicine and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians"" (New York Times), Abuelaish has been crossing the lines in the sand that divide Israelis and Palestinians for most of his life - as a physician who treats patients on both sides of the line, as a humanitarian who sees the need for improved health and education for women as the way forward in the Middle East. And, most recently, as the father whose daughters were killed by Israeli soldiers on January 16, 2009, during Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip. His response to this tragedy made news and won him humanitarian awards around the world. Instead of seeking revenge or sinking into hatred, Abuelaish called for the people in the region to start talking to each other.

Izzibella Beau (Goodreads Author),Broken,,English,,"Start the Assumption Series with book 1 – Broken  A girl’s senior year in high school should be a special time. Ayma’s expectations are not very high. She is the daughter of a control-freak mother and a father who has been absent for the past three years. She is ridiculed by the popular kids in school because of her unfortunate name and the way she dresses. Although she’s nearly eighteen, her mother controls every aspect of her life, including what she wears, who her friends are and even what foods she is allowed to eat. The only bright spot in her life is her friend Tabby. Until she meets Colton.  Colton is unexpected. He’s gorgeous, popular – the guy all the girls want and the one all of the other guys want to be like. When he begins to pay attention to Ayma, she doesn’t know what to think. Things like this just don’t happen to girls like her. One obstacle after another is thrown into their path, but they can’t deny what they feel for one another. Their new-found love will be threatened by secrets from their past, challenges in their present and a future they can only dream about. Ayma struggles to find an identity apart from her mother’s controlling nature while Colton faces the results of an arrest that took place the summer before his tenth grade year.

İhsan Oktay Anar,Suskunlar,,Turkish,,"Eflâtun rengi hayaller kuran bir “suskun”un sözleridir, bu roman. İşittiğini gören, gördüğünü dinleyen, dinlediğini sessizliğin büyüsüyle sırlayan ve tüm bunların görkemini hikâye eden bir adamın alçakgönüllü dünyasına misafir olacaksınız, satırlar akıp giderken. O ise, muzip bir tebessümle size eşlik edecek, sessizce... Sayfaları birer birer tüketirken, benzersiz erguvanî düşlerin “gerçekliği”nde semâ edeceksiniz ve bu düşlerden âdeta başınız dönecek. Hayat kadar gerçek, düş kadar inanılmaz bu dünyanın tüm kahramanlarının seslerini duyacak, nefeslerini hissedeceksiniz. Çünkü Suskunlar, sessizliğin olduğu kadar, seslerin ve sözlerin, yani musikînin romanıdır. Sonsuzluğun derin sessizliğinin “nefesini üfleyen” ve ona “can veren” bir adamın hayallerinin ete kemiğe bürünmüş kahramanları, en az sizler kadar gerçektir; ya da siz, en az onlar kadar bir düş ürünü... Bağdasar, Kirkor, Dâvut, Kalın Musa, İbrahim Dede Efendi, Rafael, Tağut, Veysel Bey ve diğerleri... Onlar, sessizliğin evreninden İhsan Oktay Anar’ın düş dünyasına duhûl ederek suskunluklarını bozmuşlardır. Bir meczûp aşkı tattı, bir âşıksa aşkına şarkılar yazıp ruhunu maviyle bezedi; diğeri, kaybolduğu dünyada bir sesin peşine düşerek kendini buldu. Nevâ, belki de, herkesin âşık olduğu bir kadının pür hayâliydi. Hayâlet avcısı, kendi ruhunu yakalamaya çalıştı. Zâhir ve Bâtın ise, zıtlıkların muhteşem birliğinde denge bulan iki ayrı gücün cisimleşmiş hâliydi. Suskunlar’ı okuduktan sonra aynaya bakmak, yansıyan aksinizde gerçeği görmek, gördüğünüzü işitmek ve duyduklarınızla sağırlaşıp susmak isteyeceksiniz.

İlber Ortaylı,Avrupa ve Biz,,Turkish,,"Türkiye Avrupa'ya ilk defa yanaşmıyor. Türkiye Avrupa ile ilk defa bir macera yaşamıyor. Türkiye'nin dokuz yüz yıllık tarihi Avrupa ile beraberdir; bunu kimse unutmasın. Bugün, Türkiye'de Avrupa Birliği denen iktisadî ve siyasî oluşumun kültürel boyutu çok az tartışılmaktadır. Kültür bir hayat tarzını ve geçmiş kuşakların mirasını ifade ettiğine göre, Avrupa ve Türkiye bir uyum içinde midir? Tarihsel geçmiş, hal ve gelecek açısından bu uyum sorununun tartışılması şarttır. Oysa toplumumuzda hem idare edenler, hem de idare edilenler, Avrupa Birliği'ni sadece iktisadî refah, serbest işgücü dolaşımı konuları etrafında ve bir kısım çevreler de insan hakları gibi kurumlar açısından düşünmekte olup; asıl önemli sorunun tartışılmasından herkes kaçınmakta, belki de hoşlanmamaktadır. Alman ülkesinden Kohl diye bir başbakan, ""Biz bunları ne biliriz?"" diyor. 18. yüzyılın sonunda, bunu hiç çekinmeden söylerim, bizimkinden edebî bakımdan daha kaliteli bir Kur'an çevirisi yapılmış bir ülkede bunu söylüyor! Haberi yok o mirastan, o büyük oryantalist mirastan; yani biz de onları tanımıyoruz, onlar da bizi tanımıyorlar, tanımamakta ısrar ediyorlar. Prof. Dr. İlber Ortaylı okuyucuyu karşılaştırmalı bir siyasal, toplumsal ve kültürel tarih gezisine çıkardığı bu eserinde, her zamanki akıcı üslubuyla ezberleri bozuyor, ""tartışılmaz doğrular"" olarak görülen pek çok konuda tabuları yıkıyor, hepimizi, yani Avrupa ve Biz'i abartmadan, çarpıtmadan, gizlenmeden gerçeklerle yüzleşmeye çağırıyor.",Seçme Eserleri #1,,11/06/07,March 2008,[],Paperback,"['Politics', 'History']",,9789944882859,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353698891l/7358493.jpg,3.98,[],91.0,1.0,,7358493-avrupa-ve-biz,,,,,94.0,193.0,246,,Türkiye İş Bankası Kültür Yayınları,"['64', '73', '45', '11', '0']",,,[],,
