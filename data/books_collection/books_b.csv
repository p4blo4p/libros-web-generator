  Innocence was never meant for the addictive…
Addiction was something Krit Corbin accepted as part of his nature a long time ago. He decided to embrace it and flip his finger at the rules. Women had always been the number one thing on his list of addictions. He couldn’t get enough. Being the lead singer in a rock band had only made access to his favorite addiction that much easier. Being alone was the only thing Blythe Denton understood. The small town minister’s family that raised her hadn’t accepted her as their own. The minister’s wife had always made sure Blythe understood just how unworthy she was of love. When Blythe is sent away to college and given a chance to finally be free of living as an unwanted burden, she looks forward to having peace in her life. Being alone isn’t something that bothers her. She escapes reality in the stories she writes.However, the ridiculously sexy tattooed guy who keeps throwing parties in the apartment above hers is driving her crazy. For starters, he doesn’t treat her like she would expect a guy with a different woman always hanging on his arm to treat someone as uninteresting as her. She looks nothing like the gorgeous women she sees parading in and out of his apartment, but for some strange reason he keeps showing up at her door.During a party at his apartment, Krit’s new neighbor comes to the door with her long brown hair pulled up in a messy knot and a pair of glasses perched on her cute little nose.

Ever since, her thoughts have been consumed by death, going so far as to foresee the ever-changing deaths of those around her. Sixteen-year-old Emily Taylor resented her sister's closeness with their father, who died when she was six. With the strange ability to read minds, she drowns the voices out with drugs, sending Jane over the edge. When seventeen-year-old Wes Green was adopted, he moved in next door to Jane, finding in her a childhood friend turned high-school crush. All summer, the pain in his bones seemed unwarranted.

When Max Gordon found himself standing above the dying body of an innocent seven-year-old girl, he saw in her eyes something he hadn't seen in the century he'd spent roaming Earth. Her father was already dead, but there was hope to save her. Jane was her name, and already she was all he ever wanted. It was his job to bring her back, and it was his job to protect her - the biggest mistake of his life. When these four teens enter Glenwood High their senior year, no one but Max could understand the future ahead of them. Drawn together by blood and friendship, they each hide a dark secret that will soon bind them together.

Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women,,"['Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Sexuality', 'Sex Work', 'History', 'Biography', 'Womens', 'Prostitution', 'Psychology']","When Harvard medical student Alexa Albert conducted a public-health study as the Mustang Ranch brothel in Nevada, the only state in the union where prostitution is legal, neither she nor the brothel could have predicted the end result. Having worked with homeless prostitutes in Times Square, Albert was intimate with human devastation cause by the sex trade, and curious to see if Nevada’s brothels offered a less harmful model for a business that will always be with us. The Mustang Ranch has never before given an outsider such access, but fear of AIDS was hurting the business, and the Ranch was eager to get publicity for its rigorous standards of sexual hygiene. Albert was drawn into the lives of the women of the Mustang Ranch, and what began as a public-health project evolved into something more intimate and ambitious, a six-year study of the brothel ecosystem, its lessons and significance. The women of the Mustang Ranch poured their stories out to Albert: how they came to be there, their surprisingly deep sense of craft and vocation, how they reconciled their profession with life on the outside. Dr. Albert went as far into this world as it is possible to go — some will say too far — including sitting in on sessions with customers, and the result is a book that puts an unforgettable face on America’s maligned and caricatured subculture.From the Hardcover edition.",,,05/08/01,June 25th 2002,[],Paperback,,9780449006580,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320396742l/101027.jpg,3.69,[],99.0,1.0,,,,92.0,1721.0,272,Ballantine Books,"['317', '718', '543', '119', '24']",,[],,['Alexa Albert']

Best Ghost Stories of Algernon Blackwood,,"['Horror', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Gothic', 'Ghosts', 'Ghost Stories', 'Weird Fiction', 'Supernatural']","A woman of snow ... a midnight caller keeping his promise ... forests where Nature is deliberate and malefic ... enchanted houses ... these are the beings and ideas that flood through this collection of ghost stories by Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951). Altogether 13 stories, gathered from the entire corpus of Blackwood's work, are included; stories of such sheer power and imagination that it is easy to see why he has been considered the foremost British supernaturalist of the twentieth century.Blackwood's ability to create an atmosphere of unrelieved horror and sustain it to the end of the story is almost unsurpassed. “The Willows” — which has been called by H.P. Lovecraft the finest supernatural story — is a typical example of Blackwood's art: slowly and surely Blackwood draws the reader into a world of shadows, nuances and unearthly terror.Blackwood was also a master at evoking feelings of mysticism and cosmic experience; dealing with such ideas as interpenetrating levels of existence and pantheistic elemental powers, he expanded the content of supernatural literature enormously. But even the more traditional elements of horror stories such as ghosts and haunted houses are handled with such energy and feeling that they rise far above their predecessors.Drawing on serious Oriental thought, modern psychology and philosophy, Algernon Blackwood introduced a sophistication to the horror story that — with a few exceptions — it was devoid of before. The results are stories that are not only guaranteed to chill, but stories that have something to say to the intelligent reader.Contents:- The Willows (1907)- Secret Worship (1908)- Ancient Sorceries (1908)- The Glamour of the Snow (1911)- The Wendigo (1910)- The Other Wing (1915)- The Transfer (1911)- Ancient Lights (1914)- The Listener (1907)- The Empty House (1906)- Accessory before the Fact (1914)- Keeping His Promise (1906)- Max Hensig (1945)",,,,June 1973,[],Paperback,,9780486229775,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1290921811l/767719.jpg,4.17,[],90.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2887.0,366,Dover Publications,"['1270', '1009', '469', '94', '45']",,[],,"['Algernon Blackwood', 'E.

Book One: Sporadic Memories,,"['Fiction', 'Canada']","Book One: Sporadic Memories is a novel about a lifestyle that needs to be read about. Within the first few pages you will realize there has been a loss, it is not sad though; the narrator expresses with great enthusiasm the life they lived, which makes it nice during the times when it becomes difficult to read. By the first few pages I hope you can hear the narrator has been alive for a long time, explaining the way it is written? There is no distinction between the characters’ genders, which offers a personal experience for the reader. The part that remembers the time they gave bracelets to each other brings about another way of joining together in marriage … following how their courtship developed, and the apple tree that is depicted throughout the novel using its fruit in traditional family recipes. It gets sad for a bit after this, but notice that it gets sad because there is so much more to why the one lost is worth writing about. It is partly a love story. You know for sure it is when you get to the parts about the piano played and songs written … you should at first read to the first song. The memory at the exhibition and recalling times in the rain and snow are next. They traveled a lot together and you will read of a place if you read a little past the description of the surroundings of their home. If you read to the first birthday mentioned; you will find a recipe worth trying, a poem worth reading, and fireworks. The narrator is a playwright, so there is a play that is broken down throughout the novel … it is a difficult read, but it is important in showing how the two brought their work together, and what positive influences they made upon those they met.Things are repeated to show how important positive repetition is, which helps to move past pain while remembering the passion. This novel is full of passion, carried throughout the life they had for each other, their work, and their friends … you might want to read through first until you hear about their friends. This novel completes the story as the pages turn; putting certain pages together will bring the memories in order. It is an easy read. It is written poetically, which gives it justice. It begins the way it ends … Book One: Sporadic Memories is a novel about a lifestyle that needs to be read about.",,,06/30/08,January 11th 2019,[],Paperback,,9781525530845,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545341202l/43191522._SX318_.jpg,4.34,[],399.0,4.0,,,,91.0,68.0,324,FriesenPress,"['44', '13', '5', '2', '4']",,[],,['Ali Marsman']

This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old."" —Amy ChuaAll decent parents want to do what's best for their children. What Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother reveals is that the Chinese just have a totally different idea of how to do that. Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions and providing a nurturing environment. The Chinese believe that the best way to protect your children is by preparing them for the future and arming them with skills, strong work habits, and inner confidence. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother chronicles Chua's iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia and Lulu, her way—the Chinese way—and the remarkable results her choice inspires.Here are some things Amy Chua would never allow her daughters to do:- have a playdate- be in a school play- complain about not being in a school play- not be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama- play any instrument other than the piano or violin- not play the piano or violinThe truth is Lulu and Sophia would never have had time for a playdate. They were too busy practicing their instruments (two to three hours a day and double sessions on the weekend) and perfecting their Mandarin.Of course no one is perfect, including Chua herself. Witness this scene:""According to Sophia, here are three things I actually said to her at the piano as I supervised her practicing:- Oh my God, you're just getting worse and worse.- I'm going to count to three, then I want musicality.- If the next time's not PERFECT, I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them!""But Chua demands as much of herself as she does of her daughters. And in her sacrifices—the exacting attention spent studying her daughters' performances, the office hours lost shuttling the girls to lessons—the depth of her love for her children becomes clear. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is an eye-opening exploration of the differences in Eastern and Western parenting—and the lessons parents and children everywhere teach one another.",,,,January 11th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9781594202841,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347794294l/9160695.jpg,3.65,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2011)'],421.0,6.0,,,,89.0,46902.0,237,Penguin Press,"['9381', '18108', '14182', '3897', '1334']",,"['New Haven, Connecticut (United States)']",,['Amy Chua']
Becoming Nicole: The Transformation of an American Family,,"['Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Gender', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Queer', 'Family', 'Psychology']","The inspiring true story of a transgender girl, her identical twin brother, and an ordinary American family’s extraordinary journey to understand, nurture, and celebrate the uniqueness in us all, from the Pulitzer Prize–winning science reporter for The Washington PostWhen Wayne and Kelly Maines adopted identical twin boys, they thought their lives were complete. But it wasn’t long before they noticed a marked difference between Jonas and his brother, Wyatt. Jonas preferred sports and trucks and many of the things little boys were “supposed” to like; but Wyatt liked princess dolls and dress-up and playing Little Mermaid. By the time the twins were toddlers, confusion over Wyatt’s insistence that he was female began to tear the family apart. In the years that followed, the Maineses came to question their long-held views on gender and identity, to accept and embrace Wyatt’s transition to Nicole, and to undergo an emotionally wrenching transformation of their own that would change all their lives forever.Becoming Nicole chronicles a journey that could have destroyed a family but instead brought it closer together. It’s the story of a mother whose instincts told her that her child needed love and acceptance, not ostracism and disapproval; of a Republican, Air Force veteran father who overcame his deepest fears to become a vocal advocate for trans rights; of a loving brother who bravely stuck up for his twin sister; and of a town forced to confront its prejudices, a school compelled to rewrite its rules, and a courageous community of transgender activists determined to make their voices heard. Ultimately, Becoming Nicole is the story of an extraordinary girl who fought for the right to be herself.Granted wide-ranging access to personal diaries, home videos, clinical journals, legal documents, medical records, and the Maineses themselves, Amy Ellis Nutt spent almost four years reporting this immersive account of an American family confronting an issue that is at the center of today’s cultural debate. Becoming Nicole will resonate with anyone who’s ever raised a child, felt at odds with society’s conventions and norms, or had to embrace life when it plays out unexpectedly. It’s a story of standing up for your beliefs and yourself—and it will inspire all of us to do the same.",,,,October 20th 2015,[],Hardcover,,9780812995411,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1443476743l/25893681._SX318_.jpg,4.2,['Stonewall Book Award Nominee for Non-Fiction (2016)'],32.0,1.0,,,,97.0,9963.0,279,Random House,"['4090', '4171', '1422', '195', '85']",,[],,['Amy Ellis Nutt']

Big Questions,,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Fantasy', 'Comic Book', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Humor']","A haunting postmodern fable, Big Questions is the magnum opus of Anders Nilsen, one of the brightest and most talented young cartoonists working today. This beautiful minimalist story, collected here for the first time, is the culmination of ten years and more than six hundred pages of work that details the metaphysical quandaries of the occupants of an endless plain, existing somewhere between a dream and a Russian steppe. A downed plane is thought to be a bird and the unexploded bomb that came from it is mistaken for a giant egg by the group of birds whose lives the story follows. The indifferent, stranded pilot is of great interest to the birds—some doggedly seek his approval, while others do quite the opposite, leading to tensions in the group. Nilsen seamlessly moves from humor to heartbreak. His distinctive, detailed line work is paired with plentiful white space and large, often frameless panels, conveying an ineffable sense of vulnerability and openness.Big Questions has roots in classic fables—the birds and snakes have more to say than their human counterparts, and there are hints of the hero’s journey, but here the easy moral that closes most fables is left open and ambiguous.

Broken Vessels,,Fiction,"Written between 1977 and 1990, universally acclaimed when they appeared in Godine hardcover, and exploring subjects close to home and close to the bone, these twenty-two diverse essays reveal the spiritual strength and shrewdly lyrical prose for which Andre Dubus has been recognized worldwide.Personal but never indulgent, sensitive but never maudlin, these forays into Dubus's past and present conjure up small worlds: a Catholic boyhood in Cajun Louisiana, the transcendental quality of baseball, the luck and slipperiness of life, the precarious business of making a living by writing. These worlds are presented in a voice that is as powerful as it is poignant, that never flinches from the stark realities that have so colored Dubus's recent past and personal life.

Trapped and burned to death in the flames were twelve-year-old Tim and his six-year-old sister Kelly. Lissa, ten, was barely able to leap to safety from the garage roof into the arms of her mother, who was standing outside the house. When Michael Farrar returned to the scene, he had lost more than his children and his home. His entire life was in ruins. The fire was the climactic event of Michael and Debora's lives. Until that summer, they seemed to have it all -- a happy marriage, successful medical practices, three bright and beautiful children. Then they went on a trip to Peru with their son. There, they met attractive, blonde Celeste Walker, whose husband, John was also a successful doctor. But after that trip, nothing was the same again for either couple, and all the dark hidden places in Debora and Michael's marriage bubbled to the surface in a series of almost unbelievable horrors.

Bad Dirt,,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Westerns', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Americana', 'The United States Of America', 'Contemporary', 'American', 'Womens']","The stories in Annie Proulx's new collection are peopled by characters who struggle with circumstances beyond their control in a kind of rural noir half-light. Trouble comes at them from unexpected angles, and they will themselves through it, hardheaded and resourceful. Bound by the land and by custom, they inhabit worlds that are often isolated, dangerous, and in Proulx's bold prose, stunningly vivid.  In ""What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?"" rancher Gilbert Wolfscale, alienated from his sons, bewildered by his criminal ex-wife, gets shoved down his throat the fact that the old-style ranch life has gone. Several stories concern the eccentric denizens of Elk Tooth, a tiny hamlet where life revolves around three bars. Elk Toothers enter beard-growing contests, scrape together a living hauling hay, catch poachers in unorthodox ways. ""Man Crawling out of Trees"" is about urban newcomers from the east and their discovery, too late, that one of them has violated the deepest ethics of the place. Above all, these stories are about the compelling lives of rapidly disappearing rural Americans.  Through Proulx's knowledge of the history of Wyoming and the west, her interest in landscape and place, and her sympathy for the sheer will it takes to survive, we see the seared heart of the tough people who live in the emptiest state.

It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering.Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families.

Rather than bringing pride to her family, it brings fear, and as a result, she is forced to live in seclusion in Ireland’s countryside. Ashling’s reputation is further blackened when she refuses her betrothed and defies the ancient laws. When her pack’s oldest rivals begin hunting her, she finds herself in the small town of York Harbor, Maine—far from everything she’s ever known.  In Maine, she crosses paths with the dark and rebellious Grey Donavan, and something ignites within her soul. There’s just one problem: Grey is human.

BloodLust,,"['Reverse Harem', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction', 'Aliens', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Military Fiction', 'High Fantasy', 'Magic']","It’s a treacherous road to belonging—and once you find it, you could lose everything.In an exotic world caught in the throes of a seemingly endless war, a nation of terrorists under the thumb of an evil Emperor has set out to systematically destroy every race but their own. And they’re just about to succeed. Lauded fantasy author Auryn Hadley (The Demons’ Muse romantic fantasy series) compellingly blends heart-stopping action-adventure, heart-breaking ethics, and toe-curling sensuality, all through the lens of a Daenerys Targaryen-esque lead—the likes of which the fantasy genre hasn’t yet seen. When you were once a slave, freed only to become a ruthless warrior, ""belonging"" seems a trite concept. A pipe dream, the stuff of naive fairy tales. But not for Salryc Luxx. Private Luxx—Sal for short—is iliri, a member of an untamable race surreptitiously dubbed ""their kind"" by humans and bred thousands of years ago to protect them. Humans consider them expendable, barely more than animals. Freaks. But in a karmic twist of fate, they’re also one of mankind’s most feared predators. Abused and enslaved, the only control Sal has over her life is what military unit she serves with – if she's good enough to be accepted – and the only one to consider her is the best in the land, the Black Blades. Everyone has secrets, and the Blades are no different. But acceptance into the Blades gives Sal something she never expected—the family she’s never had, and with it, the undying protection of seven of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. It also gifts her a devoted line of potential mates. Many of her fellow warriors will submit to the bloodlust that overtakes her in the heat of battle and can only be quenched by rough, passionate lovemaking (making way for the steamiest of love scenes). Though it’s not all war and sex. Sal very gradually cultivates deeply loving, evolving relationships with each of the Black Blades, which morphs as a unit into a reverse harem as sweet as it is fierce, and as protective as it is impassioned. But belonging has its own price. Each of the Blades would die to protect Sal. And it’s only a matter of time before the enemy moves to use this against her.Author Hadley has crafted a unique epic fantasy—and an absolute roller coaster of emotions.  Her heroine, Sal, is as loving as she is ferocious, and the demons she battles—and the way she beats them—underlie a delicate exploration of the ethical and political battles we face in every war we fight. Hadley’s clever takes on racial prejudice are subtle, yet damning—and her idea of sexual politics is a rip-roaring turn-on. Every female reader will want to be Sal… and every male, like the guys in the book, will fall for her. The first book in the Rise of the Iliri series. BloodLust does not end with a cliffhanger.

Buntschatten und Fledermäuse. Mein Leben in einer anderen Welt,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']","Buntschatten und Fledermäuse, so unterscheidet Axel Brauns die Menschen in seiner Umgebung. Buntschatten verhalten sich ruhiger und lassen ihm die Chance, Kontakt mit ihnen aufzunehmen. Fledermäuse hingegen flattern wild um ihn herum, und in ihrer Gegenwart fühlt er sich nicht wohl. Axel ist Autist und lebt in einer anderen Welt. Sein Buch gewährt uns einen tiefen Einblick in diese abgegrenzte, auf einer eigenen Ordnung beruhenden Welt, in der sich Axel wohl fühlt, die er aber gezwungenermaßen verlassen muss, um in unserer Gesellschaft nicht unter die Räder zu kommen. Im Alter von zwei Jahren bricht die Krankheit aus: Axels Wahrnehmung verblasst, er verliert die Fähigkeit, seine Mitmenschen zu erkennen und zu verstehen, sein Sprachvermögen versiegt. Doch die Eltern kämpfen unermüdlich dagegen an, dass ihr Sohn in der sozialen Isolation versinkt. Mit viel Mühe, Geduld sowie einigen Tricksereien gelingt es, Axel so ""normal"" wie möglich aufwachsen zu lassen. Er kommt in den Kindergarten, wird eingeschult und wechselt später sogar auf das ""Geräusch"" -- das Wort ""Gymnasium"" hat für Axel keinen Klang, und klanglose Worte sind für ihn nur ""Geräusche"". Doch trotz der vermittelten Normalität verbringt er die meiste Zeit in seiner Welt, weil dort vieles einfacher ist (""Es gibt Dinge, die man versteht, und es gibt Dinge, die man nicht versteht. Buntschatten gehörten zu den Dingen, die man nicht versteht."") Axel besteht das Abitur und beginnt ein BWL-Studium. Er hat dem System ein Schnippchen geschlagen: ""Die einen bleiben sitzen, die anderen werden versetzt. Ich gehörte zu keiner der beiden Arten, ich hatte es geschafft, bereits vor der ersten Klasse sitzen zu bleiben, ohne dass es ein Lehrer gemerkt hatte."" Trotz seines Arrangements mit der Normalität bleibt eine gewisse Tragik spürbar, denn die Gefühlswelt der Buntschatten bleibt Axel verschlossen. Die Bedeutung von Liebe, Tod, Mitleid und Humor erschließt sich ihm nur ansatzweise. Und dieses Unvermögen macht Axel wohl am meisten zu schaffen, wenn er am Ende bekennt: ""Alle Jugendlichen spazierten mit Siebenmeilenstiefeln in das Leben hinaus. Niemals würde ich ihnen folgen können."" Vielleicht gelingt es uns Buntschatten mithilfe dieses bewegenden Buches, Axel Brauns Welt ein bisschen besser zu verstehen. --Christoph Reudenbach",,,01/01/02,February 29th 2004,[],Paperback,,9783442152445,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330013273l/2685469.jpg,4.36,[],281.0,3.0,,,,97.0,307.0,380,Goldmann,"['157', '112', '30', '7', '1']",,[],,['Axel Brauns']

Corporations slash employees by the thousands, and the benefits and pensions once guaranteed by ""middle-class"" jobs are a thing of the past.In Bait and Switch, Barbara Ehrenreich goes back undercover to explore another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with the plausible resume of a professional ""in transition,"" she attempts to land a ""middle-class"" job. She submits to career coaching, personality testing, and EST-like boot camps, and attends job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and--again and again--rejected.Bait and Switch highlights the people who have done everything right--gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive resumes--yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster. There are few social supports for these newly disposable workers, Ehrenreich discovers, and little security even for those who have jobs. Worst of all, there is no honest reckoning with the inevitable consequences of the harsh new economy; rather, the jobless are persuaded that they have only themselves to blame.Alternately hilarious and tragic, Bait and Switch, like the classic Nickel and Dimed, is a searing expose of the cruel new reality in which we all now live.",,,08/19/05,July 25th 2006,"['Barbara Ehrenreich', 'Patrick Knowles', 'Leah Gray', 'Laiman Godel', 'John D.

  A: 
A world-class intelligence organization run by women who really know their foundation.When Nikki Lanier signs up as a cosmetics rep at Carrie Mae, it’s hardly her idea of a dream job. With a degree in linguistics and a hard-core workout regimen, the twenty-six-year-old redhead once had hopes for a real career. But unemployed and desperate to escape life at home with her nagging mother, she’ll try anything—even selling makeup to housewives. Soon, Nikki learns that the powder and lipstick are simply cover-up for the Carrie Mae Foundation: a secret organization of international espionage and high-tech mascara founded for the purpose of “helping women everywhere.” Whisked off to Thailand with the legendary Carrie Mae agent Val Robinson, Nikki is soon in over her head. Between investigating the abduction of a human rights activist, tracking down a murderous arms dealer, keeping up with her wildly dangerous new partner, and occasionally trying to date a hunk who may or may not be CIA, Nikki has to use all the courage and cosmetic technology she’s got to bring down the bad guys and get out alive. With the support of the colorful Carrie Mae crew, Nikki will overcome even the most harrowing obstacles—including incessant phone calls from her mother—or die trying.",Nikki Lanier #1,,02/04/10,March 2nd 2010,[],Paperback,,9780743292771,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404632123l/6773641.jpg,3.58,[],84.0,1.0,,,,86.0,367.0,400,Atria Books,"['72', '133', '110', '39', '13']",,[],,['Bethany Maines']

The resulting book, Notes from a Small Island, is a eulogy to the country that produced Marmite, George Formby, by-elections, milky tea, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowels, Gardeners' Question Time and people who say, 'Mustn't grumble'. Britain will never seem the same again.Once ensconced back home in New Hampshire, Bryson couldn't resist the invitation to write a weekly dispatch for the Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine. Notes from a Big Country is a collection of eighteen months' worth of his popular columns about that strangest of phenomena - the American way of life. Whether discussing the dazzling efficiency of the garbage disposal unit, the exoticism of having your groceries bagged for you, or the mind-numbing frequency of commercial breaks on American TV, Bill Bryson brings his inimitable brand of bemused wit to bear on the world's richest and craziest country.The Complete Notes combines two of Bill Bryson's best-loved travel books in one volume, It demonstrates his unique take on life - from either side of the pond.",,,,October 5th 2000,[],Hardcover,,9780385601313,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1289491565l/42883.jpg,4.1,[],92.0,1.0,,,,96.0,949.0,544,Doubleday,"['358', '378', '173', '29', '11']",,[],,['Bill Bryson']

(Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.",,,11/06/02,December 3rd 2002,[],Hardcover,,9780767915069,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388276959l/22.jpg,3.45,[],89.0,1.0,,,,85.0,8670.0,55,Broadway Books,"['1460', '2500', '3447', '1009', '254']",,[],,['Bill Bryson']

Black Elk Speaks,Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux,Biography & Autobiography,"Black Elk Speaks is the story of the Lakota visionary and healer Nicholas Black Elk (1863-1950) and his people during the momentous twilight years of the nineteenth century. Black Elk met the distinguished poet, writer, and critic John G. Neihardt (1881-1973) in 1930 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and chose Neihardt to tell his story. Neihardt understood and conveyed Black Elk’s experiences in this powerful and inspirational message for all humankind. When Black Elk received his great vision, white settlers were invading the Lakotas’ homeland, decimating buffalo herds, and threatening to extinguish the Lakotas’ way of life. The Lakotas fought fiercely to retain their freedom and way of life, a dogged resistance that resulted in a remarkable victory at the Little Bighorn and an unspeakable tragedy at Wounded Knee. Black Elk Speaks offers much more than a precious glimpse of a vanished time, however. As related by Neihardt, Black Elk’s searing visions of the unity of humanity and the earth have made this book a venerated spiritual classic. Whether appreciated as the poignant tale of a Lakota life, a history of a Native nation, or an enduring spiritual testament, Black Elk Speaks is unforgettable. This new edition features two additional essays by John G. Neihardt that further illuminate his experience with Black Elk; an essay by Alexis Petri, great-granddaughter of John G. Neihardt, that celebrates Neihardt’s remarkable accomplishments; and a look at the legacy of the special relationship between Neihardt and Black Elk, written by Lori Utecht, editor of Knowledge and Opinion: Essays and Literary Criticism of John G.

Renowned tech investor and start-up guru Brad Feld lights YOU on fire with this insider's book that will teach you how to launch, fund and run your own company. If you're already an entrepreneur or have always dreamed of being one, douse yourself in “Feld Thoughts” and catch the spark. You'll be burning, entrepreneur, with this e-book!.  Brad's blog is a backstage pass to the 24/7 rock show that is tech startups. It is a master class in startup investing for givers and takers of funds. It is a rolling critique of tech products vast and simple (with enough edge to make the most scathing restaurant critic in Manhattan blush). And it is the journal of a peripatetic marathoner who still believes he will crack the four-hour mark someday.  From such Feld Thoughts, we have constructed “The Burning Entrepreneur,” the e-book on startups that you would take to a desert island if it had electricity, a decent Internet connection and angel investors. “The Burning Entrepreneur” illuminates the actions and attitudes required to launch, fund and ignite your startup. Brad Feld is on fire. Find out what happens when you stand too close.

I’m constantly pushing, looking for the edge of whatever I do. (pg 14)  Over time, I’ve learned that none of the short-term moves in the stock market matter at all in my life. It’s occasionally entertaining to turn on CNBC and see my friend Paul Kedrosky in the octobox telling all the other people that they don’t actually understand macro-economics, but it’s no different than watching McEnroe when he’s announcing a Nadal–Federer match. It’s just sport. (pg 33)  I don’t create products anymore (I invest in companies that create them), but I’m a great alpha tester. I’ve always been good at this for some reason — bugs just find me. While my UX design skills are merely adequate, I’ve got a great feel for how to simplify things and make them cleaner. (pg 58)  If you are someone who spends 30 minutes or more a day “organizing yourself,” I encourage you to step back and think about what you could change and how that might shift you from focusing on organizing to working toward outcomes. It’s liberating.

Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Leadership', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Apple', 'Entrepreneurship']","
  The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history.  
  
 Becoming Steve Jobs breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people? Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world. A rich and revealing account, Becoming Steve Jobs shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.",,,,March 24th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,9780385347402,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440109909l/24386240._SX318_.jpg,4.15,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science & Technology (2015)'],99.0,1.0,,,,93.0,14453.0,482,Crown Business,"['6537', '5010', '1911', '562', '433']",,[],,"['Brent Schlender', 'Rick Tetzeli']"

"Bonds That Make Us Free: Healing Our Relationships, Coming to Ourselves",,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Lds', 'Inspirational', 'Parenting', 'Spirituality']","Life can be sweet. Our relationships with friends, spouses, colleagues, and family members can be wonderfully rewarding. They can also bring heartache, frustration, anxiety, and anger. We all know the difference between times when we feel open, generous and at ease with people versus times when we are guarded, defensive, and on edge. Why do we get trapped in negative emotions when it's clear that life is so much fuller and richer when we are free of them?Bonds That Make Us Free is a ground-breaking book that suggests the remedy for our troubling emotions by addressing their root causes. You'll learn how, in ways we scarcely suspect, we are responsible for feelings like anger, envy, and insecurity that we have blamed on others. (How many times have you said, ""You're making me mad?"") Even though we fear to admit this, it is good news. If we produce these emotions, it falls within our power to stop them. But we have to understand our part in them far better than we do, and that is what this remarkable book teaches. Because the key is seeing truthfully, the book itself is therapeutic. As you read and identify with the many true stories of people who have seen a transformation in their lives, you will find yourself reflecting with fresh honesty upon your relationships. This will bond you to others in love and respect and lift you out of the negative thoughts and feelings that have held you captive. You will feel your heart changing even as you read. ""It would not be accurate to describe this book as supplying the truths upon which we must build our lives,"" writes author C. Terry Warner. ""Instead it shows how we can put ourselves in that receptive, honest, and discerning condition that will enable us, any of us, to find these truths on our own.""

Bader Field,,[],"Carl David is the third generation of a four-generation family art business in Philadelphia. He is the author of Collecting & Care of Fine Art published by Crown in 1981. His article about Martha Walter, an American Impressionist painter (1875-1976), was published in the American Art Review in May 1978 Mr. David's new book, Bader Field, embodies the emotional story of a son's loving relationship with his father a legendary art dealer whose life is suddenly taken by a massive coronary at the young age of fifty-eight years. His death plunges the twenty-four-year-old man onto the front lines of the family art business, which he had entered a mere three years prior. Battling with his own grief while trying to help his adoring but fragile mother survive, David forges forward with all of the elemental tools his father imparted to him. His journey proves a difficult one, not having yet recovered from the horrific loss of his brother to suicide just eight years earlier when he was found dead on the fourth floor of the Rittenhouse Square townhouse, which was home to the prestigious David David Gallery. His self-imposed obligation is to successfully take the family art business to the next generation and to give his own children every bit of love, kindness, and wisdom bestowed upon him by the unique man whom they will never know other than the mark he left on everyone who knew him. Bader Field adds significant insight into the mysterious workings and dealings of the art world. David speaks from experience of having been immersed in it all of his life and having lived it from the inside out. There will be a tremendous crossover interest in this book as it combines the elements of an American family, its goodness and its tragedy interfaced with the multifaceted aspects of the art business and flying small airplanes. Bader Field in Atlantic City was the oldest airfield in the country. With little sophistication, its two asphalt runways juggled single and twin engine aircraft exuded a character and charm that created memories to last a lifetime.

Beautiful Children,,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Unfinished', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Dark', 'Family', 'Book Club']","One Saturday night in Las Vegas, twelve-year-old Newell Ewing goes out with a friend and doesn't come home. In the aftermath of his disappearance, his mother, Lorraine, makes daily pilgrimages to her son's room and tortures herself with memories. Equally distraught, the boy's father, Lincoln, finds himself wanting to comfort his wife even as he yearns for solace, a loving touch, any kind of intimacy. As the Ewings navigate the mystery of what's become of their son, the circumstances surrounding Newell's vanishing and other events on that same night reverberate through the lives of seemingly disconnected strangers: a comic book illustrator in town for a weekend of debauchery; a painfully shy and possibly disturbed young artist; a stripper who imagines moments from her life as if they were movie scenes; a bubbly teenage wiccan anarchist; a dangerous and scheming gutter punk; a band of misfit runaways. The people of Beautiful Children are urban nomads; each with a past to hide and a pain to nurture, every one of them searching for salvation and barreling toward destruction, weaving their way through a neon underworld of sex, drugs, and the spinning wheels of chance. In this masterly debut novel, Charles Bock mixes incandescent prose with devious humor to capture Las Vegas with unprecedented scope and nuance and to provide a glimpse into a microcosm of modern America. Beautiful Children is an odyssey of heartache and redemption; heralding the arrival of a major new writer.Advance praise for Beautiful ChildrenCharles Bock has delivered an anxious, angry, honest first novel filled with compassion and clarity. Beautiful Children is fast, violent, sexy;like a potentially dangerous ride;it could crash at any moment but never does. The language has a rhythm wholly its own;at moments it is stunning, near genius. This book is big and wild;it is as though Bock saved up everything for this moment. A major new talent. A. M. HomesBeautiful Children careens from the seedy to the beautiful, the domestic to the epic, all with huge and exacting heart.Jonathan Safran FoerBeautiful Children is the best first novel I've read in years;certainly the best first novel of our newborn century.

Black Hole,,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Science Fiction', 'Comix', 'Comic Book', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult']","Suburban Seattle, the mid-1970s. We learn from the out-set that a strange plague has descended upon the area’s teenagers, transmitted by sexual contact. The disease is manifested in any number of ways — from the hideously grotesque to the subtle (and concealable) — but once you’ve got it, that’s it. There’s no turning back.As we inhabit the heads of several key characters — some kids who have it, some who don’t, some who are about to get it — what unfolds isn’t the expected battle to fight the plague, or bring heightened awareness to it , or even to treat it. What we become witness to instead is a fascinating and eerie portrait of the nature of high school alienation itself — the savagery, the cruelty, the relentless anxiety and ennui, the longing for escape.And then the murders start.As hypnotically beautiful as it is horrifying, Black Hole transcends its genre by deftly exploring a specific American cultural moment in flux and the kids who are caught in it- back when it wasn’t exactly cool to be a hippie anymore, but Bowie was still just a little too weird.

Billy Oliver: Holding On To Memories,,[],"Billy Oliver by Charles Peters is universally appealing; this truly inspirational book was written for readers who enjoy reminiscing about the good old days, or wonder what life was like without cell phones, computers, and television. Whatever their age, it's guaranteed readers will become so engrossed in this heartfelt story, they will find it impossible to put this book down until they reach the very last page. The story takes place in the late 1940s in northwest Iowa, and reveals how a youngster's life is transformed when he finally leaves his meager existence behind to live at a new place that promises the opportunity of a bright future. When his mother becomes terminally ill, Billy, one of thirteen children, picks wild flowers every day to cheer her up. ""Remember telling me how they tell a story?"" he asks her. ""Mama, look at them. The stems are straight and strong, just like you said we are to live our lives. See how green and lush the leaves are, representing life's experiences? See all the beautiful blossoms representing love?"" After placing a white rosebud on her chest, he reminds her that she told him that thorns tell us to protect ourselves, and that unopened white buds symbolize purity and innocence, and bring the promise of a new day. When his mother dies, Billy is only nine years old, and he wonders what will happen next. Where will he sleep and eat? Will Papa abandon him now, too? When he and his siblings are sent to stay with their Aunt Sarah and Uncle Jacob, he wonders if he will ever see all the neat things he had found and stored in the barn again, or his thousand-piece horse puzzle. Three weeks later, Billy's grandma instructs the children to write their names on pieces of paper and put them into a hat, and this is how she, their father, Aunt Sarah, and Billy's eldest brother Lee decide where each of them will live. Billy subsequently moves to his grandparents' house, where he plays cards every night, listens to The Great Gildersleeve on the radio, and learns how to crochet, earn money parking cars, can vegetables, and make tomato juice. Tragically, some time after Uncle Jacob is hit by a train and killed, Grandma suffers from a brain aneurism, and Grandpa is unable to take care of both her and Billy. When Billy's father arranges for his son to be taken a hundred miles away to a home for boys and girls, ""Maybe you will get adopted,"" he says. From then on, how Billy handles repeated rejection and encourages other children at the orphanage to stay positive is outstanding, and something that is sure to touch every reader's heart. The day he is chosen for adoption at eleven years old, ""I am thrilled,"" he says. ""I can feel my heart pounding in my chest like no other time before, I was very excited."" When it's finally time for Billy to leave his colorful past behind, ""Thank you, Mama,"" he whispers, ""for teaching me good values to live by."" At last, he has a new Mom and Dad, and is about to start a new life on a farm. Written in memory of his biological mother, ""an amazing woman,"" the author says Billy's childhood experiences were inspired by many of his own. Without doubt, the feelings and emotion expressed in this book could only come from a person who has lived the story. With its happy ending, Billy Oliver is definitely a book readers will want to keep and treasure forever.",,,,September 27th 2011,[],Paperback,,9781461146599,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348558901l/12827152.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,3.0,190,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,[],,[],,['Charles Peters']

In his search for meaning and purpose in the face of the Watergate scandal, Colson penned Born Again.

Professor Fisher in Montreal ist Spezialist für das Klonen von Mäusen und Kühen. An Menschen hat er sich bisher noch nicht gewagt. Bis er bei einem Konzert die bekannte und erfolgreiche Komponistin und Pianistin Iris trifft. Iris, dreißig Jahre alt, ist unheilbar an Multipler Sklerose erkrankt. Sie beschließt, daß es höchste Zeit wird für ein Kind. Da sie den geeigneten Vater kurzfristig nicht zur Hand hat und sie nicht irgendein Kind möchte, bittet sie Fisher um Hilfe. ""Für mich kommt nur ein Klon-Kind in Frage. Ich könnte es nicht ertragen, mich an ein unbegabtes Kind zu verschwenden."" Und so entsteht Siri -- die exakte Kopie von Iris, selbst der Name ist nicht frei von der allgegenwärtigen, starken Mutter, die zugleich Schwester, ja eineiiger Zwilling ist. Für Siri, die zunächst willig die Erwartungen ihrer Mutter erfüllt, wird es mit zunehmendem Alter schwer, die eigene Identität zu finden. Bei einem Blick in den Spiegel sieht sie Iris in jungen Jahren. Erst als ihre Mutter stirbt, kann Siri sich selbst als eigenständige Person entdecken. Charlotte Kerner spielt in Blueprint die Situation eines Klons bis in feine psychologische Verästelungen durch und gibt, ohne mit dem moralischen Zeigefinger bereit zu stehen, eine Menge Anregungen, sich unbefangen dem Thema zu nähern.

In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. Born to Run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.",,,04/23/09,May 5th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780307266309,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320531983l/6289283.jpg,4.29,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2009)'],1479.0,18.0,,,,96.0,168304.0,287,Knopf,"['84420', '57427', '19830', '4400', '2227']",,"['Mexico', 'Colorado (United States)']",,['Christopher McDougall']

But What If We're Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past,,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'History', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'Thriller', 'Suspense']","We live in a culture of casual certitude. This has always been the case, no matter how often that certainty has failed. Though no generation believes there’s nothing left to learn, every generation unconsciously assumes that what has already been defined and accepted is (probably) pretty close to how reality will be viewed in perpetuity. And then, of course, time passes. Ideas shift. Opinions invert. What once seemed reasonable eventually becomes absurd, replaced by modern perspectives that feel even more irrefutable and secure—until, of course, they don’t.But What If We’re Wrong? visualizes the contemporary world as it will appear to those who'll perceive it as the distant past. Chuck Klosterman asks questions that are profound in their simplicity: How certain are we about our understanding of gravity? How certain are we about our understanding of time? What will be the defining memory of rock music, five hundred years from today? How seriously should we view the content of our dreams? How seriously should we view the content of television? Are all sports destined for extinction? Is it possible that the greatest artist of our era is currently unknown (or—weirder still—widely known, but entirely disrespected)? Is it possible that we “overrate” democracy? And perhaps most disturbing, is it possible that we’ve reached the end of knowledge?Kinetically slingshotting through a broad spectrum of objective and subjective problems, But What If We’re Wrong? is built on interviews with a variety of creative thinkers—George Saunders, David Byrne, Jonathan Lethem, Kathryn Schulz, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, Junot Díaz, Amanda Petrusich, Ryan Adams, Nick Bostrom, Dan Carlin, and Richard Linklater, among others—interwoven with the type of high-wire humor and nontraditional analysis only Klosterman would dare to attempt.

So begins this prequel to the Exit Unicorns series, as we join the Riordan boys in the rough and tumble world of Belfast, Northern Ireland, during a summer of change and promise. Casey Riordan is on the cusp on manhood, and is learning just how high the price of that transition can be. Tagging along on this adventure is his brother, Pat, who is both shadow and conscience to Casey. Their father, Brian, is simply trying to keep his sons safe—a tall order in the gritty streets of this particular city.   Bare Knuckle spans the events of one summer, giving a glimpse into the lives of the Riordans—the boys as they embark on the path to the men they are destined to be, and their father as he guides them along the way. The road is not smooth and contains hard lessons, both those of betrayal and treachery, all stemming from the events of one warm July night, when the match of hatred is set to the fuel of violence.

Buddhist Economics: An Enlightened Approach to the Dismal Science,,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Buddhism', 'Business', 'Spirituality', 'Finance', 'Politics', 'Philosophy']","Traditional economics measures the ways in which we spend our income, and doesn't attribute worth to the crucial human interactions that give our lives meaning.Clair Brown, an economist at UC Berkeley and a practicing Buddhist, has developed a holistic model, one based on the notion that quality of life should be measured by more than national income. Brown advocates an approach to organizing the economy that embraces, rather than skirts, questions of values, sustainability, and inequality. Complementing the award-winning work of Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs, and the paradigm-breaking spirit of Thomas Piketty and Amartya Sen, Brown incorporates the Buddhist emphasis on interconnectedness, capability, and happiness into her vision for a sustainable and compassionate world.Buddhist economics leads us to think mindfully as we go about our daily activities, and offers a way to appreciate how our actions affect the welfare of those around us. By replacing the endless cycle of desire with more positive collective priorities, our lives can become more meaningful as well as happier.

Being the Bad Boy's Victim,,"['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'High School', 'School', 'New Adult']","“Babe, you might want to close your mouth… unless you’re offering something, if you know what I mean…”  For Bellatrix Brown, going back to America was like eating an entire bowl of broccoli—absolutely revolting. Returning to that country meant leaving the people she cared about in London.  Connor Michaels, the devilishly handsome bad boy of the school, never really cared about anything, especially not about girls. His usual game: use them then lose them…that is, until he came upon a stunning British belle.  The day Bella and Connor's paths crossed, seats were overturned, hot spaghetti was spilled, and sexual innuendos were flung around like confetti.

Between The Lines: Volumes of Words Unspoken,,['Poetry'],"How does one describe a feeling? Some say there are no words that can perfectly reproduce one’s feelings in another—but poetry comes close.  Written with incredible honesty and self-knowledge, Between the Lines is a stunning collection of poems from Céline Zabad. Ranging in length from a single line to full pages, her poems mimic at once the brevity and vastness of feeling. Her verse is at times as free as a cloud, other times as solid as stone.

Zabad encapsulates the thrill of love’s first blush and the freezing burn of heartbreak. Her feelings flow freely throughout the collection, lending her poetry uncommon authenticity and power. Nature thrives between the lines of her verse, reminding the reader that tears are as natural as raindrops.  Whether you’re looking for new ways to think about your own feelings or are simply passionate about poetry, you’ll find plenty to love in this collection.

Dugim razgovorima pronalazili su osnovne boje: plava, zelena, crvena, bijela… U dječakovim snovima se stalno pojavljivao jedan zeleni zmaj koji se volio tući, bio je naporan, ali ga je dječak ipak volio. Dječak se zaljubio u krotiteljevu kćer. Jednog dana tigar je ugrizao njegovu ljubav pa je ona bila nekoliko dana u bolnici. Dječak ju je nekoliko dana posjećivao, nosio joj cvijeće… Kad su se jednog dana klaunovi u cirkusu posvađali, dječak je imao zadaću da radi u cirkusu. Njegovi roditelji su ga svakodnevno pripremali za predstave. Dječak je stalno bio obučen u bijeli kostim, a i lice mu je bilo namazano bijelom bojom. Nije volio da mu se ljudi smiju pa je nakon treće predstave prestao raditi u cirkusu. Jednog je dana obukao bijeli kostim, lice je namazao bijelom bojom i krenuo u svijet. Stigao je do kamena gdje su on i starac obično razgovarali. Starca je čekao tri dana, ali njega nije bilo. Iz svoga kovčega je uzeo plavu boju i nacrtao je duboku plavu suzu na svom licu.",,,01/01/88,2008,[],Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1291678682l/9436327.jpg,4.14,[],94.0,1.0,,,,92.0,293.0,148,Meandar,"['139', '86', '44', '19', '5']",,[],,['Damir Miloš']

Still convincingly female, though in no way dumb and girly, fortyish Juanita serves drinks to the colorful crew patronizing Herb's Cafe in South Fort Worth, worries herself sick over a hot-to-trot daughter proving too fond of drugs and the dealers who sell them, endures a hypochondriac mother whose whinings would justify murder, dates a fellow middle-ager whose connections with the oil industry are limited to dipstick duty at his filling station—and, by the way, she also hopes to become a singer-songwriter in the real country tradition of Bob Wills and Willie Nelson.

With alllies - unseen and even unknown - working behind the scenes to help them, the team is trapped in the midst of a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse with the deadliest of consquences, a game that not all of them will survive...

It is an integral part of their marriage, child rearing, and community. In this daring new book, distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In ""Breaking the Spell,"" Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith. In a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history, philosophy, and psychology, Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly, he contends that the ""belief in belief"" has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need.""Breaking the Spell"" is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives, our interactions, and our country.

She has a loving dad, an absent mother and a brother who plays more X-Box than is good for him. She also has the neighbours from hell: the five Oswald girls and their thuggish father Bob, vicious bullies all of them, whose reign of terror extends unchallenged over their otherwise quiet suburban street. And yet terrifying though they undoubtedly are, the stiletto-wearing, cider-swilling Oswald girls are also sexy - so when Saskia asks shy, virginal Rick Buckley for a ride in his new car, he can't believe his luck. Too bad that Saskia can't keep her big mouth shut. When, after a quick fumble, she broadcasts Rick's deficiencies to anyone who will listen, it puts ideas into her younger sisters silly head - ideas that will see Rick dragged off to prison, humiliated, and ultimately, in his fathers words, broken by the experience. From her hospital bed, Skunk guides us through the events that follow, as Saskia's small act of thoughtlessness slowly spreads through the neighbourhood in a web of increasing violence. Skunk watches as her shabby, hardworking father finds love, only for her courageous, idealistic teacher to lose it; as poor broken Buckley descends into madness, while across the street her brother Jed makes his first adolescent forays into sex; and as her own gentle romance with soft-hearted, tough-talking Dillon struggles to survive against a backdrop that seamlessly combines the sublime and the ridiculous.

O protagonista (cujo nome não conhecemos) se afasta da relação conturbada com os outros membros da família e mergulha em um isolamento geográfico e psicológico. Ao mesmo tempo, ele empreende a busca pela verdade no caso da morte do avô, o misterioso Gaudério, que teria sido assassinado décadas antes na mesma Garopaba, na época apenas uma vila de pescadores.Sempre acompanhado por Beta, cadela do falecido pai, o professor esquadrinha as lacunas do pouco que lhe é revelado, a contragosto, pelos moradores mais antigos da cidade. Portador de uma condição neurológica congênita que o obriga a interagir com as outras pessoas de modo peculiar, o professor estabelece relações com alguns moradores: uma garçonete e seu filho pequeno, os alunos da natação, um budista histriônico, a secretária de uma agência turística de passeios.

Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey Into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism,,"['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Travel', 'Anthropology', 'Memoir', 'Occult']","A dazzling work of personal travelogue and cultural criticism that ranges from the primitive to the postmodern in a quest for the promise and meaning of the psychedelic experience. While psychedelics of all sorts are demonized in America today, the visionary compounds found in plants are the spiritual sacraments of tribal cultures around the world. From the iboga of the Bwiti in Gabon, to the Mazatecs of Mexico, these plants are sacred because they awaken the mind to other levels of awareness--to a holographic vision of the universe.Breaking Open the Head is a passionate, multilayered, and sometimes rashly personal inquiry into this deep division. On one level, Daniel Pinchbeck tells the story of the encounters between the modern consciousness of the West and these sacramental substances, including such thinkers as Allen Ginsberg, Antonin Artaud, Walter Benjamin, and Terence McKenna, and a new underground of present-day ethnobotanists, chemists, psychonauts, and philosophers. It is also a scrupulous recording of the author's wide-ranging investigation with these outlaw compounds, including a thirty-hour tribal initiation in West Africa; an all-night encounter with the master shamans of the South American rain forest; and a report from a psychedelic utopia in the Black Rock Desert that is the Burning Man Festival.Breaking Open the Head is brave participatory journalism at its best, a vivid account of psychic and intellectual experiences that opened doors in the wall of Western rationalism and completed Daniel Pinchbeck's personal transformation from a jaded Manhattan journalist to shamanic initiate and grateful citizen of the cosmos.",,,11/06/02,August 12th 2003,[],Paperback,,9780767907439,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352498243l/1815.jpg,4.06,[],88.0,1.0,,,,94.0,3104.0,336,Three Rivers Press (CA),"['1185', '1159', '571', '149', '40']",,[],,"['Daniel Pinchbeck', 'Lee Fukui']"
Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Mental Health', 'Adult']","One of the world's fifty living autistic savants is the first and only to tell his compelling and inspiring life story - and explain how his incredible mind works.This unique first-person account offers a window into the mind of a high-functioning, 27-year-old British autistic savant with Asperger's syndrome. Tammet's ability to think abstractly, deviate from routine, and empathize, interact and communicate with others is impaired, yet he's capable of incredible feats of memorization and mental calculation. Besides being able to effortlessly multiply and divide huge sums in his head with the speed and accuracy of a computer, Tammet, the subject of the 2005 documentary Brainman, learned Icelandic in a single week and recited the number pi up to the 22,514th digit, breaking the European record. He also experiences synesthesia, an unusual neurological syndrome that enables him to experience numbers and words as ""shapes, colors, textures and motions."" Tammet traces his life from a frustrating, withdrawn childhood and adolescence to his adult achievements, which include teaching in Lithuania, achieving financial independence with an educational Web site and sustaining a long-term romantic relationship. As one of only about 50 people living today with synesthesia and autism, Tammet's condition is intriguing to researchers; his ability to express himself clearly and with a surprisingly engaging tone (given his symptoms) makes for an account that will intrigue others as well.",,,01/09/06,January 9th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781416535072,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440235885l/74812._SY475_.jpg,3.84,[],253.0,3.0,,,,92.0,20005.0,226,Free Press,"['5396', '7861', '5200', '1237', '311']",,[],,['Daniel Tammet']

Her father, Jim, is tall and slender, and her mother, Christina, is a fine-boned, dark-haired beauty. Both are self-centered, outspoken, and disappointed by their daughter’s looks. When Victoria is six, she sees a photograph of Queen Victoria, and her father has always said she looks just like her. After the birth of Victoria’s perfect younger sister, Gracie, her father liked to refer to his firstborn as “our tester cake.” With Gracie, everyone agreed that Jim and Christina got it right.While her parents and sister can eat anything and not gain an ounce, Victoria must watch everything she eats, as well as endure her father’s belittling comments about her body and see her academic achievements go unacknowledged.

The one thing she knows is that she has to get away from home, and after college in Chicago, she moves to New York City.Landing her dream job as a high school teacher, Victoria loves working with her students and wages war on her weight at the gym.

Bournemouth Boys and Boscombe Girls,,[],"We’re the oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases and hard cases, and this book is for those who ‘get it’ In the lead-up to a recent reunion party, many of the old stories came out. We were seasonal workers during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s in Bournemouth. Many worked the deckchairs, some worked hotels, pubs, bars, or nightclubs, either as bar staff or bouncers. We lived off our wits and, yes, from time to time we were rogues, but we had each other’s backs and we had some laughs. This book recalls those days and tells the story of bringing a special group of people back together again after almost 40 years. And do you know what, it was as if we hadn’t skipped a beat. There were even people who’d missed each other first time around, yet all of us have a very rare and exceptional connection. It’s pure magic. Now if you’re reading the above and are thinking this was some kind of school reunion with a bunch of old codgers on Zimmer fames, playing inflatable ball games and drinking Dandelion & Burdock, mate, you’ve got it all wrong! If you’ve worked holiday towns as a seasonal worker, either in the UK or abroad, then you’ll ‘get it’ or if you’re looking to work a season in Spain or Portugal or the South coast of England, then these are the tough but crazy times you can expect. I’ve always loved wild people and wild places, always been drawn to them, and here are some of the stories. Now, for the first time ever, I think I understand what was so special about those years. Yes, at times they were tough, but we stuck with each other through thick and thin, and especially afterwards when we travelled the globe together. We’re not crazy, none of us (well, those in prison and mental asylums might be), but none of us on the ‘out’ are, but we had lively, buoyant and animated fun. We were carefree at an age when you’re supposed to be carefree. The flip side of this, I’m well aware, is that at times it may make some of us feel as if we’re outsiders, a lone wolf so to speak. People occasionally talk about us in hushed tones, whispering that we’re a bit of a loose cannon. They don’t really want to say it to our faces because every now and again we can still be a little unpredictable. But they look at us with a strange curiosity, because in comparison – although they’re often very successful at ‘fitting in’ – they lead lives that are drab, dreary and monotonous. They’re not unruly like you and me. And it’s that unruliness which has kept us young. These are the stories, some told in very funny poetic format, of those years. This book has been published for the people who shared those years to be able to keep a record. If you weren’t around on the south coast during the late 70’s and early 80’s I’d honestly give this book a miss. That’s as honest as we can get, because you won’t know the people involved, and it’s unlikely you’ll ‘get it’ Some of us, you see, weren’t meant to be tamed. We weren’t meant to be pacified or subdued. We were meant to run free until we discovered others just as wild to run with. And after all we’ve been through, we’re still standing and we’re still laughing out loud. And that bothers some people. Danny and I wish to dedicate this book to all who couldn’t be there on the night. Some are living abroad, some are in prison, others in mental institutions, and some have passed on. This isn’t anything morbid. We just want to remember the laughs they gave us.

Now he returns with a startling exploration of our human entanglement with the rest of nature.  As the climate veers toward catastrophe, the innumerable losses cascading through the biosphere make vividly evident the need for a metamorphosis in our relation to the living land. For too long we’ve ignored the wild intelligence of our bodies, taking our primary truths from technologies that hold the living world at a distance. Abram’s writing subverts this distance, drawing readers ever closer to their animal senses in order to explore, from within, the elemental kinship between the human body and the breathing Earth.

He shares an apartment with Goldberg, his beloved battery-operated fish, sleeps on a bed littered with yellow legal pads penned with what he hopes will be the next great American novel, and spends the waning malaise-filled days of the Carter administration at Yankee Stadium, waxing poetic while slinging peanuts to pay the rent.When Ted hears the news that his estranged father, Marty, is dying of lung cancer, he immediately moves back into his childhood home, where a whirlwind of revelations ensues. The browbeating absentee father of his youth is living to make up for lost time, but his health dips drastically whenever his beloved Red Sox lose.

Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time,,"['Chess', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Sports', 'Politics', 'Games', 'Russia', 'Gaming', 'Journalism']","In the summer of 1972, with a presidential crisis stirring in the United States and the cold war at a pivotal point, two men - the Soviet world chess champion Boris Spassky and his American challenger Bobby Fischer - met in the most notorious chess match of all time. Their showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, held the world spellbound for two months with reports of psychological warfare, ultimatums, political intrigue, cliffhangers, and farce to rival a Marx Brothers film.Thirty years later, David Edmonds and John Eidinow have set out to reexamine the story we recollect as the quintessential cold war clash between a lone American star and the Soviet chess machine - a machine that had delivered the world title to the Kremlin for decades. Drawing upon unpublished Soviet and U.S. records, the authors reconstruct the full and incredible saga, one far more poignant and layered than hitherto believed.The authors chronicle how Fischer, a manipulative, dysfunctional genius, risked all to seize control of the contest as the organizers maneuvered frantically to save it - under the eyes of the world's press. They can now tell the inside story of Moscow's response, and the bitter tensions within the Soviet camp as the anxious and frustrated apparatchiks strove to prop up Boris Spassky, the most un-Soviet of their champions - fun-loving, sensitive, and a free spirit. Edmonds and Eidinow follow this careering, behind-the-scenes confrontation to its climax: a clash that displayed the cultural differences between the dynamic, media-savvy representatives of the West and the baffled, impotent Soviets.

Bayou Da Vinci,,[],"“Bayou Da Vinci” is the story of a brilliant but crazy high school English teacher. An original thinker who lives in the backwaters of Louisiana, Wally Zeringue (nicknamed “Bayou Da Vinci” by his students) is widely liked by his students because of the long-winded stories he tells in class.But there is a problem with the man because he is actually three people in one!In addition to his “Bayou Da Vinci” persona, there’s also his madcap alter ego, “Mr. Z,” who often takes over in the middle of Wally’s classes. Mr. Z doesn’t talk to animals, inanimate objects and invisible people; he argues with them. However, he makes too much sense to be called crazy but is far too crazy to be considered sane.And then there’s “I.” A dark soul, “I” is the identical twin brother of Wally (who doesn’t have a twin brother). “I is the mirror image of Wally — except for the scar on his lower lip.

A manic cross between Mark Leyner, Fran Lebowitz, and the National Enquirer, Sedaris’s collection of essays is a rollicking tour through the national Zeitgeist: a do-it-yourself suburban dad saves money by performing home surgery; a man who is loved too much flees the heavyweight champion of the world; a teenage suicide tries to incite a lynch mob at her funeral; a bitter Santa abuses the elves.David Sedaris made his debut on NPR’s Morning Edition with “SantaLand Diaries”, recounting his strange-but-true experiences as an elf at Macy’s, and soon became one of the show’s most popular commentators. With a perfect eye and a voice infused with as much empathy as wit, Sedaris writes stories and essays that target the soulful ridiculousness of our behavior.

Odd Thomas has come here to learn to live fully again, and among the eccentric monks, their other guests, and the nuns and young students of the attached convent school, he has begun to find his way. The silent spirits of the dead who visited him in his earlier life are mercifully absent, save for the bell-ringing Brother Constantine and Odd’s steady companion, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.But trouble has a way of finding Odd Thomas, and it slinks back onto his path in the form of the sinister bodachs he has met previously, the black shades who herald death and disaster, and who come late one December night to hover above the abbey’s most precious charges.

What would happen if one of them walked the streets of London at night?Once a proud warrior, elven prince Elathan was living in exile, fallen from grace and separated from his own people. He wanted the mortal woman the moment he saw her standing on Blackfriars Bridge, staring down into the darkness with unbearable pain in her eyes. This strangely compelling female also happened to have luscious curves that made his body ache with desire.Naturally, he decided to hunt the woman down, drag her to his lair and command her to become his slave of pleasure. But would her frail human body survive a night of untamed passion in the arms of a Fae?After a devastating breakup with her fiancé, Igraine Chandler was spending her honeymoon in England all by herself, her life utterly bereft of meaning. For who could ever love a plain, slightly overweight nurse from New Jersey with nothing left but a broken heart and her lost dreams of a home and a family?But she never imagined that she would soon set out into a world beyond her wildest dreams, and help a prince reclaim his throne …Set in a medieval fantasy world of noble knights, monsters and magicians, honor, betrayal and revenge, “Bound to the Prince” is a romance influenced by Celtic mythology and Arthurian legends. But in its heart, it’s a story of a woman’s inner development to a new, strong, self; uninhibited desire, boundless love, loss and sacrifice.***“Too long have I lived in this darkness, human,"" he said, so close to her that his lips touched her earlobe, light as a butterfly’s wing. “Alone.”	Igraine felt the elf’s hot breath as it caressed her cheek. He lowered his head slightly, inhaling deeply. She knew he was taking in her scent. Despite her fear, the urge to touch him was growing so strong that she started to reach out to him. He caught both of her wrists with one of his large hands, pinning them against the wall so she was his helpless prey once again. She gasped when she felt his tongue touch the sensitive spot right below her ear, licking her very softly as if he wanted to taste her before eating her alive. His beauty, his seductive voice were the predator’s way of lulling his prey into a false sense of security before killing, without regret.	“So warm, so alive,” he murmured. “And yet you are doomed to die, with every breath you take.” His lips moved downwards, along the side of her neck where the blood rapidly pulsated in her carotid artery. She felt his teeth graze her skin right there.	She never saw it coming. If he had attacked, intending to kill her, she wouldn’t have been surprised. But the elf moved so quickly that she couldn’t comprehend what was happening to her. Still imprisoning her hands above her head, he used his free arm to pull her nearer to his body until only a thin layer of fabric separated them.

Næste dag da mørket falder på udvælger de sig en 11-årig dreng, Freddy, på grund af hans glødende interesse for skrækmagasinet SLIM, der altid har historier med om uhyggelige væsner. Derfor reagerer han ikke så frygtsomt som andre børn. Da han først er blevet sat ind i balladen om den forsvundne mumie, hjælper han de venlige monstre helt frivilligt. Det er dog stadig ikke nogen nem opgave for en ligbleg vampyr, en vel(?)klædt ulv, en mand i tøj fra 1500-tallet med hang til at miste hovedet og en klodset kæmpe at slippe for opmærksomhed.

Now Blood from a Stone brings Commissario Brunetti back on the scene: On a cold Venetian night shortly before Christmas, a street vendor is killed in a scuffle in Campo Santo Stefano. The closest witnesses to the event are the American tourists who had been browsing the man's wares—fake designer handbags—before his death. The dead man had been working as a vu cumpra, one of the many African immigrants peddling goods outside normal shop hours and trading without work permits.Commissario Brunetti's response is that of everybody involved: Why would anyone kill an illegal immigrant? Because these workers have few social connections and little money, infighting seems to be the answer. And yet the killings have all the markings of a professional operation. Once Brunetti begins to investigate this unfamiliar Venetian underworld, he discovers that matters of great value are at stake within the secretive society.While his wife, Paola, struggles to come to terms with their young daughter's prejudices about the immigrants, Brunetti finds that his own police force shares many of the same biases. Warned by Patta, his superior, to desist from further involvement in the case, Brunetti only becomes more determined to unearth the truth. How far will Brunetti be able to penetrate the murky subculture of Venice's illegal community? And how high does the corruption reach into the upper echelons of Brunetti's own world and the world at large?By a confirmed master storyteller, Blood from a Stone is a pitch-perfect mystery, an alluring portrait of contemporary Venice, and an elucidating eye into the attitudes of a timeless place in the grip of change.",Commissario Brunetti #14,,01/01/05,May 2nd 2006,"['Commissario Guido Brunetti', 'Paola Brunetti', 'Vice-Questore Patta']",Paperback,,9780143036982,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388265750l/71677.jpg,3.86,[],177.0,2.0,,,,95.0,5637.0,355,Penguin Books,"['1307', '2560', '1510', '218', '42']",,['Venice (Italy)'],,['Donna Leon']

After the early deaths of his mother and a beloved older sister, he is kept away from school and tutored at home by his father, a curate, who rests all his ambitions for his children on his only son. Branwell grows up isolated in his family’s parsonage on the moors, learning Latin and Greek, being trained in painting, and collaborating on endless stories and poems with his sisters.Yet while his sisters go on to write Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, and Agnes Grey, Branwell wanders from job to job, growing increasingly dependent on alcohol and opium and failing to become a great poet or artist.With rich, suggestive sentences “perfectly fitted to this famously imaginative, headstrong family” (Publishers Weekly), Branwell is a portrait of childhood dreams, thwarted desire, the confinements of gender―and an homage to the landscape and milieu that inspired some of the most revolutionary works of English literature.",,,11/30/05,July 7th 2020,[],Paperback,,9781593765972,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572618384l/48658191.jpg,3.22,[],100.0,1.0,,,,74.0,110.0,256,Soft Skull,"['20', '25', '36', '17', '12']",,[],,"['Douglas A.

Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on earth.Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite--the largest ever discovered--from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the Rolvaag, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking-along with its unique cargo-to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed.But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead, it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space.Now, that organism has implanted itself in the sea bed two miles below the surface-and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task which requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the ""meteorite"" has a mind of its own-and it has no intention of going quietly...

When native plants disappear, the insects disappear, impoverishing the food source for birds and other animals. In many parts of the world, habitat destruction has been so extensive that local wildlife is in crisis and may be headed toward extinction.Bringing Nature Home has sparked a national conversation about the link between healthy local ecosystems and human well-being, and the new paperback edition—with an expanded resource section and updated photos—will help broaden the movement.

Black Eden,,[],"“That church is the devil’s playground,” she had warned him. But despite the warning from his now-dead wife, Benjamin Thomas has finally obtained the post he has been coveting for years: he and his son, Forrest, are now Pastor and Assistant Pastor of the First St. Marks Missionary Baptist Church. They are given a choice of housing: the parsonage beside the church or a mansion, an old plantation, that has been donated to the church by a former member. Because of its dark past: the horrors of slavery, the disappearance of a past pastor and his family, and the reported murder and suicide of another pastor and his wife, they were warned against taking the mansion. Ben chooses the mansion.Forrest discovers that there is major corruption going on in the church and that the chairman of the Deacon Board, Gaston Burton Davis—who is also the town’s mayor—is at the core of it all. He also suspects that his father is being threatened in an effort to get him to go along with the corruption. The morning after a meeting with Deacon Davis, other members of the Deacon Board, and the head of the Trustee Board, Forrest knew that his suspicions were true. His father comes down to breakfast looking as if he had been fighting with the devil himself all night. And, indeed, he probably had been—the aftermath of his meeting with Deacon Davis and his pose from the church the night before. He could not just sit by and do nothing while his father was being harassed. With the help of one of the mothers of the church, Forrest tries to save his father, and the church, from the negative forces that are working against First St. Marks.

After the birth of her first child in 2006, Turkish writer Elif Shafek suffered from postpartum depression that triggered a profound personal crisis. Infused with guilt, anxiety, and bewilderment about whether she could ever be a good mother, Shafak stopped writing and lost her faith in words altogether. In this elegantly written memoir, she retraces her journey from free-spirited, nomadic artist to dedicated but emotionally wrought mother. Identifying a constantly bickering harem of women who live inside of her, each with her own characteristics--the cynical intellectual, the goal-oriented go-getter, the practical-rational, the spiritual, the maternal, and the lustful--she craves harmony, or at least a unifying identity. As she intersperses her own experience with the lives of prominent authors such as Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Alice Walker, Ayn Rand, and Zelda Fitzgerald, Shafak looks for a solution to the inherent conflict between artistic creation and responsible parenting.

But when a horrific car accident takes the life of his best friend and leaves him badly injured, his life will never be the same. With physical injuries that are so severely disabling that his dream of playing professional baseball is all but extinguished, he begins to spiral into emotional turmoil.In the depths of despair, Jarrod can’t seem to climb out of his depression, even as his body begins to heal.

Forced into a desperate search through a menacing web of danger, Jarrod is led further into the unknown than he ever thought possible.

Bull Halsey,,Biography & Autobiography,"Applauded by the public and revered by the men who served under him, Adm. William F. Halsey was one of the leading American personalities of World War II. His reputation as a no-holds-barred fighter and his tough-guy expression earned him the nickname ""Bull,"" yet he was also known for showing genuine compassion toward his men and inspiring them to great feats in the Pacific. Originally disclaiming the praise heaped on him, Halsey eventually came to believe in the swashbuckling legend that surrounded him, and his conduct became increasingly controversial. Naval historian E. B. Potter, who established his reputation with an award-winning biography of Chester W. Nimitz, gets behind the stereotype of this national hero and describes Halsey at his best and worst, including his controversial actions at Leyte Gulf. To write this book Potter had full access to Halsey's family and to the admiral's private papers and provides detail of Halsey's youth and career before the war.

One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together,"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years, ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life―the theologian and the spy―to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In a deeply moving narrative, Metaxas uses previously unavailable documents―including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts―to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen.In ""Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy""―""A Righteous Gentile vs the Third Reich,"" Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching 1939 decision to leave the safe haven of America for Hitler's Germany, and using extended excerpts from love letters and coded messages written to and from Bonhoeffer's Cell 92, Metaxas tells for the first time the full story of Bonhoeffer's passionate and tragic romance.Readers will discover fresh insights and revelations about his life-changing months at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and about his radical position on why Christians are obliged to stand up for the Jews. Metaxas also sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's reaction to Kristallnacht, his involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in ""Operation 7,"" the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.""Bonhoeffer"" gives witness to one man's extraordinary faith and to the tortured fate of the nation he sought to deliver from the curse of Nazism. It brings the reader face to face with a man determined to do the will of God radically, courageously, and joyfully―even to the point of death.

Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement. Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles. The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin—a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers—or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?Over fifteen years after its debut, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.Collecting Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4",Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4,,01/28/86,November 2012,"['Oliver Queen', 'Harvey Dent', 'Alfred Pennyworth', 'Carrie Kelley', 'James Gordon', 'Selina Kyle', 'Bruce Wayne', 'Joker', 'Superman']",Hardcover,,9781563893414,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327892039l/59960.jpg,4.26,[],5558.0,77.0,,,,94.0,161494.0,197,DC Comics,"['84169', '47439', '20566', '5702', '3618']",,['United States of America'],,"['Frank Miller', 'Klaus Janson', 'Lynn Varley']"

Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape,,"['Science', 'Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Nature', 'Anthropology', 'Biology', 'Africa', 'Photography', 'Science Nature']","This remarkable primate with the curious name is challenging established views on human evolution. The bonobo, least known of the great apes, is a female-centered, egalitarian species that has been dubbed the ""make-love-not-war"" primate by specialists. In bonobo society, females form alliances to intimidate males, sexual behavior (in virtually every partner combination) replaces aggression and serves many social functions, and unrelated groups mingle instead of fighting. The species's most striking achievement is not tool use or warfare but sensitivity to others.In the first book to combine and compare data from captivity and the field, Frans de Waal, a world-renowned primatologist, and Frans Lanting, an internationally acclaimed wildlife photographer, present the most up-to-date perspective available on the bonobo. Focusing on social organization, de Waal compares the bonobo with its better-known relative, the chimpanzee. The bonobo's relatively nonviolent behavior and the tendency for females to dominate males confront the evolutionary models derived from observing the chimpanzee's male power politics, cooperative hunting, and intergroup warfare. Further, the bonobo's frequent, imaginative sexual contacts, along with its low reproduction rate, belie any notion that the sole natural purpose of sex is procreation. Humans share over 98 percent of their genetic material with the bonobo and the chimpanzee. Is it possible that the peaceable bonobo has retained traits of our common ancestor that we find hard to recognize in ourselves?Eight superb full-color photo essays offer a rare view of the bonobo in its native habitat in the rain forests of Zaire as well as in zoos and research facilities. Additional photographs and highlighted interviews with leading bonobo experts complement the text. This book points the way to viable alternatives to male-based models of human evolution and will add considerably to debates on the origin of our species. Anyone interested in primates, gender issues, evolutionary psychology, and exceptional wildlife photography will find a fascinating companion in Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape.",,,04/23/97,October 27th 1998,[],Paperback,,9780520216518,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328244282l/880684.jpg,4.31,[],70.0,1.0,,,,98.0,458.0,200,University of California Press,"['234', '145', '68', '8', '3']",,[],,"['Frans de Waal', 'Frans Lanting']"
Blue Octavo Notebooks,,"['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Czech Literature', 'Memoir', 'Writing']","From late 1917 until June 1919, Franz Kafka ceased to keep a diary, for which he had used quarto-size notebooks, instead writing in a series of smaller, octavo-size notebooks. When Kafka's literary executor, Max Brod, published the diaries in 1948, he omitted these notebooks--which include short stories, fragments of stories and other literary writings--because, he wrote, -notations of a diary nature, dates, are found in them only as a rare exception.- The Blue Octavo Notebooks have thus remained little known and yet are among the most characteristic and brilliantly gnomic of Kafka's work. In addition to otherwise unpublished material, the notebooks contain some of Kafka's most famous aphorisms within their original context.

But hidden inside the socially awkward, fussy busybody is a woman who has more imagination, bigger dreams, and a warmer heart that anyone around her realizes.When Britt-Marie walks out on her cheating husband and has to fend for herself in the miserable backwater town of Borg—of which the kindest thing one can say is that it has a road going through it—she finds work as the caretaker of a soon-to-be demolished recreation center.

A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today.

Benjamin Dove,,"['Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Childrens', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Coming Of Age']","As an adult, Benjamin Dove looks back on a childhood summer that changed his life forever. A summer when his new friend Roland, seemingly descended from the knights of the past, encouraged him to stand up for himself and for those he loves. It was a summer when he and his friends formed the Order of the Red Dragon that gave them a sense of identity and purpose in their turbulent world; a summer when innocent childhood games were torn apart by an almost inevitable tragedy. Benjamin Dove is a brilliantly conceived work of fiction, tinged with both light and dark humor. Disturbing themes are explored, from bullying to child abuse to rivalry, yet there is always a sense of a child's unbreakable spirit. Published to acclaim in 1992, Benjamin Dove has won several book awards, including the International Board on Books for Young People Award (the IBBY), The Icelandic Children's Book Award, and the Reykjavik City Children's Book Award. It has also been made into a feature length film of the same name, that went on to win awards at eight international film festivals.

Beyond Good and Evil,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Religion', 'Psychology', '19th Century', 'Theory', 'Literature', 'History']","Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, also available in Penguin Classics.""One of the greatest books of a very great thinker."" —Michael Tanner",,,10/28/86,February 27th 2003,"['Zarathustra', 'Dionysus (mythology)']",Paperback,,9780140449235,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388607391l/12321.jpg,4.0,[],3120.0,44.0,,,,92.0,66727.0,240,Penguin Classics,"['25093', '23579', '12643', '3569', '1843']",,[],,"['Friedrich Nietzsche', 'R.

I. Gurdjieff (1866-1949) has come to be recognized as one of the most original, enduring, and penetrating of our century. While Gurdjieff used many different means to transmit his vision of the human dilemma and human possibility, he gave special importance to his acknowledged masterwork, Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson.  Beelzebub's Tales is an ""ocean of story"" and of ideas that one can explore for a lifetime. It is majestic in scale and content, challengingly inventive in prose style, and, for those very reasons, often approached with apprehension.

Since then, readers have recognized the need for a revised translation that would clarify the verbal surface while respecting the author's own thought and style.  This revised edition, in preparation for many years under the direction of Gurdjieff's closest pupil, Jeanne de Salzmann, meets this need.

Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness.    By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, this memoir is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.  ",,,05/10/16,February 7th 2017,[],Paperback,,9780735213463,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1484165172l/33358204._SY475_.jpg,3.63,[],96.0,1.0,,,,88.0,13954.0,340,Riverhead Books,"['2837', '4944', '4556', '1344', '273']",,[],,['Garrard Conley']

The fire worked well when it was burning, but it had burned down. His hatchet and knife would have done nothing more than make the bear really angry -- something he did not like to think about -- and his bow was good only for smaller game. He had never tried to shoot anything bigger than a fool bird or rabbit with it and doubted that the bow would push the arrow deep enough to do anything but -- again -- make the bear really mad. He bundled in his bag that night, the end of the two weeks of warm weather. He kept putting wood on the fire, half afraid the bear would come back. All the while he tried to think of a solution. But in reality, the bear was not his primary adversary. Nor was the wolf, nor any animal. Brian had become his own worst enemy because in all the business of hunting, fishing and surviving he had forgotten the primary rule: Always, always pay attention to what was happening. Everything in nature means something and he had missed the warnings that summer was ending, had in many ways already ended, and what was coming would be the most dangerous thing he had faced since the plane crashed.",Brian's Saga #3,,01/01/96,January 12th 1998,['Brian Robeson'],Mass Market Paperback,,9780440227199,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438636861l/141372._SY475_.jpg,4.02,['Iowa Teen Award (1998)'],80.0,1.0,,,,94.0,25747.0,144,Laurel Leaf,"['9329', '9359', '5617', '1078', '364']",,['Canada'],,['Gary Paulsen']

So she went for easy—playing life safe, running away from a home that harbored nothing but bad memories and challenges and loving a man who would take her away from it all forever. It’s funny how chance takes over when you need it most. And that’s exactly what brought Cody Carmichael into her life. A former motocross super star, Cody was now happy to be living the blue collar life, spending his days finishing up school and his nights under the hood of some classic car, just trying to keep everything his father taught him alive. Cody and Charlie were living parallel lives, until they finally collided. And the moment he smiled at her, Charlie knew he was the one who would change everything. But was she willing to take the risk? Cody saw through it all. He saw her—all of her. But would letting him in be too much to take? And if Charlie let herself love him—really love him—could he love her back?",,,02/23/14,February 25th 2014,[],ebook,,9781310247644,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388355087l/20347484.jpg,3.88,[],88.0,1.0,,,,89.0,1511.0,350,Ginger Scott,"['534', '500', '305', '102', '70']",,[],,['Ginger Scott']

Being George Washington,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'American Revolution', 'Presidents', 'Self Help', 'Military Fiction']","IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW GEORGE WASHINGTON, THINK AGAIN.This is the amazing true story of a real-life superhero who wore no cape and possessed no special powers—yet changed the world forever. It’s a story about a man whose life reads as if it were torn from the pages of an action novel: Bullet holes through his clothing. Horses shot out from under him. Unimaginable hardship. Disease. Heroism. Spies and double-agents. And, of course, the unmistakable hand of Divine Providence that guided it all.Being George Washington is a whole new way to look at history. You won’t simply read about the awful winter spent at Valley Forge—you’ll live it right alongside Washington. You’ll be on the boat with him crossing the Delaware, in the trenches with him at Yorktown, and standing next to him at the Constitutional Convention as a new republic is finally born.Through these stories you’ll not only learn our real history (and how it applies to today), you’ll also see how the media and others have distorted our view of it. It’s ironic that the best-known fact about George Washington—that he chopped down a cherry tree—is a complete lie. It’s even more ironic when you consider that a lie was thought necessary to prove he could not tell one.For all of his heroism and triumphs, Washington’s single greatest accomplishment was the man he created in the process: courageous and principled, fair and just, respectful to all. But he was also something else: flawed.It’s those flaws that should give us hope for today. After all, if Washington had been perfect, then there would be no way to build another one. That’s why this book is not just about being George Washington in 1776, it’s about the struggle to be him every single day of our lives. Understanding the way he turned himself from an uneducated farmer into the Indispensable (yet imperfect) Man, is the only way to build a new generation of George Washingtons that can take on the extraordinary challenges that America is once again facing.",,,11/11/11,November 22nd 2011,[],Hardcover,,9781451659269,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348994660l/12262732.jpg,4.04,[],49.0,1.0,,,,92.0,3289.0,287,Threshold Editions,"['1319', '1134', '572', '165', '99']",,[],,['Glenn Beck']

Writing in a lyrical mixture of Spanish and English that is her unique heritage, she meditates on the condition of Chicanos in Anglo culture, women in Hispanic culture, and lesbians in the straight world. Her essays and poems range over broad territory, moving from the plight of undocumented migrant workers to memories of her grandmother, from Aztec religion to the agony of writing. Anzaldua is a rebellious and willful talent who recognizes that life on the border, ""life in the shadows,"" is vital territory for both literature and civilization.

With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers. Burr is a portrait of perhaps the most complex and misunderstood of the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. Burr retains much of his political influence if not the respect of all. And he is determined to tell his own story.

Young, attractive and very ambitious, George Duroy, known to his admirers as Bel-Ami, is offered a job as a journalist on La Vie francaise and soon makes a great success of his new career. But he also comes face to face with the realities of the corrupt society in which he lives - the sleazy colleagues, the manipulative mistresses, and wily financiers - and swiftly learns to become an arch-seducer, blackmailer and social climber in a world where love is only a means to an end. Written when Maupassant was at the height of his powers, ""Bel-Ami"" is a novel of great frankness and cynicism, but it is also infused with the sheer joy of life - depicting the scenes and characters of Paris in the belle epoque with wit, sensitivity, and humanity. Douglas Parmee's translation captures all the vigour and vitality of Maupassant's novel.

Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism,,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Finance', 'International Relations', 'Political Science', 'Money', 'Audiobook']","A rising young star in the field of economics attacks the free-trade orthodoxy of The World Is Flat head-on—a crisp, contrarian history of global capitalism.One economist has called Ha-Joon Chang ""the most exciting thinker our profession has turned out in the past fifteen years."" With Bad Samaritans, this provocative scholar bursts into the debate on globalization and economic justice. Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the ""World Is Flat"" orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, today's economic superpowers—from the U.S. to Britain to his native Korea—all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade and—via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization—ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.Unlike typical economists who construct models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as sacrosanct—but developed our own industries by studiously copying others' technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growth—but many developing countries had higher GDP growth before they were pressured into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are struggling to follow in our footsteps.",,,July 5th 2007,December 26th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781596913998,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312041078l/1032019.jpg,4.18,[],17.0,1.0,,,,96.0,4235.0,288,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,"['1791', '1658', '606', '136', '44']",,[],,['Ha-Joon Chang']

We can’t escape this explosion of digital information and few of us want to–the benefits are too seductive. The technology has enabled unprecedented innovation, collaboration, entertainment, and democratic participation. But the same engineering marvels are shattering centuries-old assumptions about privacy, identity, free expression, and personal control as more and more details of our lives are captured as digital data.Can you control who sees all that personal information about you? Can email be truly confidential, when nothing seems to be private? Shouldn’t the Internet be censored the way radio and TV are? Is it really a federal crime to download music? When you use Google or Yahoo! to search for something, how do they decide which sites to show you? Do you still have free speech in the digital world? Do you have a voice in shaping government or corporate policies about any of this?Blown to Bits offers provocative answers to these questions and tells intriguing real-life stories.

Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?

She has failed to give him a son, and her sharp intelligence and strong will have alienated his old friends and the noble families of England.When the discarded Katherine, Henry's first wife, dies in exile from the court, Anne stands starkly exposed, the focus of gossip and malice, setting in motion a dramatic trial of the queen and her suitors for adultery and treason. At a word from Henry, Thomas Cromwell is ready to bring her down. Over a few terrifying weeks, Anne is ensnared in a web of conspiracy, while the demure Jane Seymour stands waiting her turn for the poisoned wedding ring. But Anne and her powerful family will not yield without a ferocious struggle. To defeat the Boleyns, Cromwell must ally himself with his enemies. What price will he pay for Annie's head?

Thompson is to drug-addled, stream-of-consciousness, psycho-political black humor what Forrest Gump is to idiot savants.""—The Philadelphia InquirerSince his 1972 trailblazing opus, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, Hunter S. Thompson has reported the election story in his truly inimitable, just-short-of-libel style. In Better than Sex, Thompson hits the dusty trail again—without leaving home—yet manages to deliver a mind-bending view of the 1992 presidential campaign—in all of its horror, sacrifice, lust, and dubious glory. Complete with faxes sent to and received by candidate Clinton's top aides, and 100 percent pure gonzo screeds on Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Oliver North, here is the most true-blue campaign tell-all ever penned by man or beast.""[Thompson] delivers yet another of his trademark cocktail mixes of unbelievable tales and dark observations about the sausage grind that is the U.S. presidential sweepstakes. Packed with egocentric anecdotes, musings and reprints of memos, faxes and scrawled handwritten notes...Memorable.""--Los Angeles Daily News""What endears Hunter Thompson to anyone who reads him is that he will say what others are afraid to....[He] is a master at the unlikely but invariably telling line that sums up a political figure....In a year when all politics is—to much of the public—a tendentious and pompous bore, it is time to read Hunter Thompson.""—Richmond Times-Dispatch""While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment. He made himself a part of every story, made no apologies for it and thus produced far more honest reporting than any crusading member of the Fourth Estate....Thompson isn't afraid to take the hard medicine, nor is he bashful about dishing it out....He is still king of beasts, and his apocalyptic prophecies seldom miss their target.""—Tulsa World""This is a very, very funny book.

When she crosses paths with Boone, she doesn’t know whether to trust him or not—and then she has no choice.

Beren and Lúthien,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'High Fantasy', 'Poetry', 'Romance', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure']","The tale of Beren and Lúthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion, the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year. Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal elf. Her father, a great elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril. In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Lúthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost. Published on the tenth anniversary of the last Middle-earth book, the international bestseller The Children of Húrin, this new volume will similarly include drawings and color plates by Alan Lee, who also illustrated The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and went on to win Academy Awards for his work on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. ",Middle-earth Universe,,,June 1st 2017,"['Beren', 'Lúthien', 'Morgoth', 'Thingol', 'Melian', 'Mandos']",Hardcover,,9780008214197,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1476980147l/32708664._SY475_.jpg,3.98,[],94.0,1.0,,,,94.0,8755.0,288,HarperCollins,"['2899', '3384', '1956', '427', '89']",,['Middle-earth'],,"['J.

Beginner's Greek,,"['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult Fiction', 'Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Romantic', 'Literary Fiction', 'Love']","When Peter Russell finally meets the woman of his dreams he falls as madly in love as you can on a flight from New York to LA. Her name is Holly. She's achingly pretty with strawberry-blonde hair, and reads Thomas Mann for pleasure. She gives Peter her phone number on a page of ""The Magic Mountain,"" but in his room that night Peter finds the page is inexplicably, impossibly, enragingly...gone. So begins the immensely entertaining story of Peter and his unrequited love for his best friend's girl; of Charlotte and her less-than-perfect marriage to a man in love with someone else; of Jonathan and his wicked and fateful debauchery; and of Holly, the impetus for it all. Along the way, there's the evil boss, the desirable temptress, miscommunications, misrepresentations, fiendish behavior, letters gone astray, and ultimately, an ending in which every character gets his due.Both incisive and wonderfully funny, this is a brilliantly understated comedy of manners in which love lost is found again. ""James Collins has written a romantic, funny and insightful page turner about love in modern times, missed opportunities and the wheel of fate (with a blow-out!) that is so engaging and real, you will find it impossible to put down. Peter Russell is an everyman filled with longing, lust and good sense. I promise you will root for him as fate throws him curves aplenty on his path to true love.

Ben Hogan: An American Life,,"['Sports', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']","Authorized, intimate, and definitive, Ben Hogan: A Life is the long-awaited biography of one of golf’s greatest, most enigmatic legends, narrated with the unique eloquence that has made author James Dodson a critically acclaimed national bestseller. One man is often credited with shaping the landscape of modern golf. Ben Hogan was a short, trim, impeccably dressed Texan whose fierce work ethic, legendary steel nerves, and astonishing triumph over personal disaster earned him not only an army of adoring fans, but one of the finest careers in the history of the sport. Hogan captured a record-tying four U.S. Opens, won five of six major tournaments in a single season, and inspired future generations of professional golfers from Palmer to Norman to Woods.Yet for all his brilliance, Ben Hogan was an enigma. He was an American hero whose personal life, inner motivation, and famed “secret” were the source of great public mystery. As Hogan grew into a giant on the pro tour, the combination of his cool outward demeanor and invincible, laser-guided accuracy on the golf course froze formidable opponents in their tracks. In 1949, at the peak of his career, Hogan’s mystique was reinforced by a catastrophic automobile accident in which he and his wife, Valerie, were nearly killed after being hit head-on by a Greyhound bus. Doctors predicted Hogan might never walk again – let alone set foot on another golf course. But his miraculous three-year recovery and comeback led to one of the greatest performances in golf history when in 1953 he won the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open (something that’s never been repeated). In this first-ever family-authorized biography, renowned author James Dodson expertly and emotionally reconstructs Hogan’s complicated life. He discovers an intensely honest man handicapped by self-doubt, buoyed by the determination to prove his own abilities, and unable to escape a long-buried childhood tragedy – the core of the Hogan “secret.” Dodson also reveals both the legendary devotion and eventual strain in Hogan’s sixty-two-year marriage, and a Hogan rarely seen by the public: a warm, jovial man whose charitable spirit and sharp business sense enabled him to build the powerful golf equipment company bearing his name to this day. Ben Hogan: A Life is the authoritative inside portrait golf fans have long awaited.",,,10/30/04,May 3rd 2005,[],Paperback,,9780767908634,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320546077l/337825.jpg,4.36,[],97.0,1.0,,,,98.0,376.0,544,Three Rivers Press,"['190', '140', '40', '3', '3']",,[],,['James Dodson']

Bitterroot,,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Westerns', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Audiobook', 'Holland', 'Detective']","The Barnes & Noble ReviewEx-Texas Ranger Billy Bob Holland makes his third appearance (after 
  Heartwood
 and the Edgar Award-winning 
  Cimarron Rose
) in James Lee Burke's dark, sorrowful, appropriately titled new novel, Bitterroot. This time out, Burke takes Holland out of the familiar environs of Deaf Smith, Texas, and moves him to Montana, where he becomes enmeshed in an interlocking series of brutal -- and brutalizing -- events.Ostensibly, Bill Bob Has come to Montana for an extended fishing vacation with long-time friend Tobin ""Doc"" Voss, a widowed Vietnam vet and a man of strong, if contradictory, principles. Voss, an impassioned environmentalist, has lobbied publicly against the incursions of a local mining corporation and has made some powerful enemies, a fact that becomes clear when a trio of drug-addled bikers are sent to rape and terrorize his teenaged daughter, Maisey. In the aftermath of that rape, the leader of the bikers is found burned to death in his bed. Doc, of course, emerges as the primary suspect, and finds himself arrested for premeditated murder. Billy Bob Holland's subsequent investigation begins with Maisey's rape and moves steadily outward, encompassing pedophilia, organized crime, right-wing extremism, and virtually every possible combination of personal and institutional corruption, all of which stand in stark contrast to the pristine, vulnerable beauty of the Montana landscape. Participants in this grim complex of narratives include an alcoholic mystery novelist, an embittered federal agent, a psychopathic ex-con with a very personal agenda, an undercover informant with a hidden motive for murder, and a local physician who has lost both her husband and son, and whose life has collapsed beneath her insupportable grief.At the center of all this is Billy Bob Holland himself, a fundamentally decent man who is literally haunted by a specter from his past, and who must constantly confront his ""abiding anger"" and his extreme capacity for violence. Like Dave Robichaux, Burke's other series hero, he is both a witness to and participant in the moral crises of the age. In Bitterroot, his urgent, eloquent narrative voice is as compelling as ever, lending depth and credibility to this disturbing, beautifully crafted book.

James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom,"" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict.

Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Scotland', 'Politics', 'Historical', 'Ireland', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'War']","More than 27 million Americans today can trace their lineage to the Scots, whose bloodline was stained by centuries of continuous warfare along the border between England and Scotland, and later in the bitter settlements of England’s Ulster Plantation in Northern Ireland. Between 250,000 and 400,000 Scots-Irish migrated to America in the eighteenth century, traveling in groups of families and bringing with them not only long experience as rebels and outcasts but also unparalleled skills as frontiersmen and guerrilla fighters. Their cultural identity reflected acute individualism, dislike of aristocracy and a military tradition, and, over time, the Scots-Irish defined the attitudes and values of the military, of working class America, and even of the peculiarly populist form of American democracy itself. Born Fighting is the first book to chronicle the full journey of this remarkable cultural group, and the profound, but unrecognized, role it has played in the shaping of America. Written with the storytelling verve that has earned his works such acclaim as “captivating . . . unforgettable” (the Wall Street Journal on Lost Soliders), Scots-Irishman James Webb, Vietnam combat veteran and former Naval Secretary, traces the history of his people, beginning nearly two thousand years ago at Hadrian’s Wall, when the nation of Scotland was formed north of the Wall through armed conflict in contrast to England’s formation to the south through commerce and trade. Webb recounts the Scots’ odyssey—their clashes with the English in Scotland and then in Ulster, their retreat from one war-ravaged land to another. Through engrossing chronicles of the challenges the Scots-Irish faced, Webb vividly portrays how they developed the qualities that helped settle the American frontier and define the American character. Born Fighting shows that the Scots-Irish were 40 percent of the Revolutionary War army; they included the pioneers Daniel Boone, Lewis and Clark, Davy Crockett, and Sam Houston; they were the writers Edgar Allan Poe and Mark Twain; and they have given America numerous great military leaders, including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Audie Murphy, and George S. Patton, as well as most of the soldiers of the Confederacy (only 5 percent of whom owned slaves, and who fought against what they viewed as an invading army). It illustrates how the Scots-Irish redefined American politics, creating the populist movement and giving the country a dozen presidents, including Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. And it explores how the Scots-Irish culture of isolation, hard luck, stubbornness, and mistrust of the nation’s elite formed and still dominates blue-collar America, the military services, the Bible Belt, and country music. Both a distinguished work of cultural history and a human drama that speaks straight to the heart of contemporary America, Born Fighting reintroduces America to its most powerful, patriotic, and individualistic cultural group—one too often ignored or taken for granted.",,Expanded Edition,11/06/04,October 11th 2005,[],Paperback,,9780767916899,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388209350l/223428.jpg,3.81,[],89.0,1.0,,,,89.0,1455.0,400,Broadway Books,"['436', '520', '334', '114', '51']",,[],,['James Webb']
Bliss: An Anthology of Novellas,,['Historical'],"Home is where the heart is…. Five authors, five tales spanning centuries all set in the same mansion on the water...	To some of us, home is everything. Our connection to the past, a place in which to build a future, the only place to run when the world we know falls apart….	For Livie Harrington, Bliss is everything. It’s a house comprised of memories, the last remaining link to her past. In a life shattered by the war between the states, Bliss becomes Livie’s anchor, the driving force behind her desperate scramble to rebuild a lost family fortune. She’s lost her parents, her only love, and her brother is off fighting somewhere north of the Mason-Dixon. She can’t lose Bliss, too… but what’s a girl to do besides the most outlandish, most lucrative endeavor to arise from the Federal blockade?	Everything is going well for Livie when a desperate need to be home invades her busy life. A need she can’t ignore. But waiting for Livie is a houseful of trouble… her dying brother, and the man who risked everything to honor his last wish… the man who broke Livie’s heart long ago, and whom she thought never to see again….A house built to outlast the generations….	After achieving great wealth, Colin Harrington, Livie’s grandson, travels to England to bring a bride back home to Bliss, stately seat of his empire. He meets and marries Lady Jane, whose father is titled but debt-ridden, and before long, Jane is expecting Colin’s heir. Yet, one ill-fated decision tears Jane’s world apart when the luxury liner HMS Titanic on which she and Colin are traveling hits an iceberg in the icy North Atlantic and sinks.	Facing a life without her husband is difficult for Jane, and if not for Bridgett, her lady’s maid, and the kind staff at Bliss, she might have lacked the courage to carry on. A new home, in a strange new land, and the first thing she must do is bury her husband in the family plot. Plagued by nightmares of the sinking ship, her health is in jeopardy, and it is decided that she needs a distraction to help her deal with her grief.	Bliss has everything… a sweeping expanse of lawn that borders the sound, tall trees, and lush bushes… everything but a garden like the one Jane left behind in England. A garden on the scale of the one she is planning will require a gardener, and Jane’s handyman has the perfect candidate… handsome, earthy Brennan Brown.	The Irishman, like Jane, is newly come to America, and somewhat put off to be working for a member of the English aristocracy. Yet, despite coming from very different backgrounds, the two strike up an unlikely friendship that soon lends to the melding of their hearts. Yet, as Jane and Brennan feel the stirrings of a new love, outside forces threaten. The mysterious Mr. Brown, like Jane, has come to the Carolinas looking for a new start... leaving behind a past that comes back to haunt him, threatening not only his relationship with Jane, but his freedom.A place where lives are lived, and new legacies are forged….	It is the tumultuous 1960’s, a time of upheaval and social unrest. Scenes from the Viet Nam War are played out nightly in living rooms across the country, and the great house on the sound has passed into the care of another family.	April has fond memories of summers at Bliss, and after her fairytale wedding disintegrates, it becomes her refuge. The one place where she can attempt to pull the threads of a life unraveling back together. Yet, unbeknownst to April, the stately house has been neglected in recent years. The once sound roof is leaking in a few dozen places, and the wharf is falling apart. Nothing is the same as she remembers—except for Hale, a Viet Nam soldier who is haunted by a dreadful secret, and who is also her brother’s best friend. .. a brother killed in the conflict that is tearing the country apart.	In Hale’s presence, April finds familiarity, and solace. They share a grief for a lost loved one, and from the comfort of his arms, passion blooms. Yet, April’s future is unresolved. A wealthy, arrogant almost-bridegroom wants her back… and the ghosts of Viet Nam are whispering to her new love.The final resting place for a shattered marriage… or a cherished place to rebuild….	Bobby Wayne Forsythe is Nascar’s darling. He’s a superstar of the circuit, and on the verge of becoming a has-been because of a tragic accident. Broken in body, and bruised in spirit, he returns to the place where he can lick his wounds and come to grips with his own dark future… a house he has shared with four now-ex-wives. 	Bobby Wayne has played it fast and loose, enjoying his celebrity status, and women have come and gone with regularity… but there is one woman he couldn’t forget… the one who shows up at his door unexpectedly.	Lauren’s marriage to Bobby Wayne was bittersweet, and coming back to the home they shared is not an easy thing to do… but she desperately needs to put the past behind her, and get on with her life. But when the Country Music star arrives at Bliss, the home she dearly loved, she finds herself confronted—not by a time-honored residence—but a glaring tribute to Bobby Wayne’s career. The wonderful old residence has been completely redecorated by wife Number ---, and Lauren is horrified.	The mansion is not the only thing that has undergone drastic changes. There’s a change in Bobby Wayne as well, and though Lauren remains determined to lay their past to rest, she finds it harder to do than she ever imagined.	Bobby Wayne is hard-bodied, and white-hot sexy, and they soon discover that they can’t keep their hands off one another.

Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey Into Bhutan,,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Biography Memoir', 'Cultural', 'Autobiography', 'Canada']","At age 24 Jamie Zeppa, a Canadian who had never been outside of North America, said goodbye to her fiancé and her plans for graduate school and moved to Bhutan, a remote Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas. Beyond the Sky and the Earth is an autobiographical work that details her experiences and transformations after spending three years in Bhutan. It is as much a book about Zeppa's day-to-day life in Bhutan as it is about the personal awakenings and realizations that she had while living there. Visitors to Bhutan, an increasingly hot tourist destination, are still few and far between, largely because of tight government restrictions on entry, visa requirements, and a law requiring tourists to spend at least $200 a day there. There aren't many books on Bhutan, and even fewer first-hand accounts of life there. Beyond the Sky and the Earth stands out as both an informative introduction to the people and culture of Bhutan and as a beautiful piece of travel literature set against the backdrop of one of the most remote and unspoiled places on earth. Zeppa recounts her experiences living abroad, such as learning to live without electricity and carrying on a forbidden affair with one of her students, in such a compelling way that even someone who has never left home will become entranced by her story and captivated by her unique experiences. Naturally, Zeppa experienced culture shock when she arrived in Bhutan. The hardships she encountered seemed insurmountable, and at first she thought she couldn't bear it and fantasized about returning to Canada. She had to learn a new language in order to communicate with her students, she had to learn to live on her own, and she had to learn to deal with homesickness. Perhaps her biggest challenge was learning how to reconcile her growing love for Bhutan with her nostalgia for her life in Canada, her family, and her fiancé. But after living among Bhutan's Himalayan peaks, lush valleys, colorful villages, and friendly people, and after gaining an appreciation for life in a place frozen in time, Zeppa realizes that she feels at home in Bhutan and wants to stay.Although to Zeppa Bhutan is a magical land, she cautions herself and the reader not to deem it ""the last Shangri-La,"" as is often done by the lucky travelers who make their way through the red tape required for entry into the kingdom. Bhutan is not without its problems: it is an underdeveloped country plagued by the problems that affect many places cut off from modernity. There is infant mortality, illness, and poverty. There are also domestic and international tensions that stem from the government's stringent regulations intended to preserve the national culture. Among them are the prohibition of foreign television and a requirement that people wear the national dress, a kira for women and a gho for men.Few of us will ever get to see the place that was Zeppa's home. But her narrative is so clear and insightful that you easily feel as though you are sharing this portion of her life with her. Even if you haven't had the experience of living abroad, or if the prospect of a trip to the furthest reaches of Asia is not in your cards, Zeppa's book is a worthy read on many levels. From her powerful use of language to describe the superb beauty of Bhutan's landscape to her passionate description of her spellbinding relationship with her future husband, Beyond the Sky and the Earth draws readers in and takes them on her rocky ride to self-realization. When trying to explain to a friend what she finds appealing about Bhutan, Zeppa writes: ""It takes a long time to find the true words, to put them in order, to tell the whole story. It is not just this or that, the mountains, the people, it is me and the way I can be here, the freedom to walk unafraid into the great dark night. It is a hundred thousand things and I could never trace or tell all the connections and reflections, the shadows and echoes and secret relations between them.""But, in fact, Zeppa does tell the reader about these connections and reflections in a lyrical way. After reading the book, you will have a deep understanding, appreciation, and respect for Zeppa's strength of character and for the wonders of Bhutan.Beyond the Sky and the Earth is a delight to read in every way. Zeppa's beautiful prose, peppered alternately with funny observations and profound soul-searching, is a truly special and unique work that will leave you craving an adventure of your own.",,,May 18th 1999,May 1st 2000,[],Paperback,,9781573228152,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309283944l/145249.jpg,4.16,[],5.0,1.0,,,,96.0,3440.0,303,Riverhead Books,"['1396', '1370', '529', '105', '40']",,['Bhutan'],,['Jamie Zeppa']

She's tired of it all, so when, on her sixteenth birthday, her parents tell her that she is cursed and will go to sleep for a hundred years when the clock strikes midnight, she's actually kind of glad to leave it all behind.

Cath is scatterbrained, messy, and–since she had her heart broken a few years back–emotionally closed off. Si is impossibly tidy, bitchy, and desperate for a man of his own. They live in London’s West Hampstead along with their lifelong friends, Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with a devil-spawn child and a terrifying Swedish nanny, Ingrid.All’s well (sort of) until the sudden arrival of a college friend–the stunningly beautiful Portia, who’s known for breaking hearts. Though they’ve grown up and grown apart from Portia, the four friends welcome her back into the fold. But does Portia have a hidden agenda or is she merely looking to reconnect with old friends? Her reappearance soon unleashes a rollicking series of events that tests the foursome’s friendships to the limit and leaves them wondering if a happy ending is in store.Fortunately, Cath has plenty to take her mind off Portia’s schemes–like her gutsy decision to leave her job in advertising to fulfill her dream of opening a bookstore. And then there’s James, the sexy real-estate agent who keeps dropping by even after the bookstore deal is done. With his irresistible smile and boyish charm could he be the one to melt Cath’s heart? Told with Jane Green’s captivating wit and flare, Bookends is above all a story about friendship–its twists, turns and complications–and how it weathers the challenges of love, ambition, marriage, and, most of all, growing up.

What Randal learns brings Niko back from the Misty Isles of Bandara and forces Tempus and his Stepsons into an alliance unholy even by Tysian standards - with Cime the mage killer; A kelon, lord of dreams; and the Rankan Third Commando, a fighting unit so cruel it gives even the Stepsons pause. Together with Tempus' long-lost daughter, and his elemental lover, Jihan, they must venture beyond accursed Wizardwall itself to battle the Mygdonian Alliance and Roxane's Nisibisi witchcraft. The intrepid Band (whose central core is Tempus' beloved Stepsons) must figure out who among the Tysian locals, Rankan soldiers, and Mygdonian defectors they can trust - before it's too late. But in a world where a witch can turn a warrior into a flea, where gemstone frogs can rain from the sky, where no one is ever what he seems, where loyalties are ensured by curses, wizardry, and the favor of warring gods... only the immortal Tempus can guarantee an army's success. And not even Tempus can tell the good guys from the bad in Tyse, where everyone plays both ends against the middle - or if the price of victory against Mygdonia will be his Stepsons' souls in their battle BEYOND THE VEIL, sequel to BEYOND SANCTUARY.

Back to the Bedroom,,Fiction,"Dear Reader: In a previous life, before the time of Plum, I wrote twelve short romance novels. Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales. I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Back to the Bedroom is presented here in almost original form. I've done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around. I lived in northern Virginia when I wrote Back to the Bedroom. My children were young, and we spent a lot of time visiting the Washington, D.C. museums and wandering through the historic neighborhoods. One day while strolling Capitol Hill I came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination. The houses were totally different -- a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house, and yet they shared a common wall. I wondered about the people who lived inside the houses. And eventually the houses inspired Back to the Bedroom. Back to the Bedroom is the story of a young woman with the soul of a birthday cake living in a bran muffin house -- and a nice-looking guy with the substance of a bran muffin living in a birthday cake. They share some misadventures, some romantic moments, some misunderstandings, and ultimately they turn into wedding cake. And for Plum fans, you'll be interested to find that this was the first of the four romances to feature Elsie Hawkins, the prototype for Grandma Mazur.

At the age of five, Jazz transitioned to life as a girl, with the support of her parents. A year later, her parents allowed her to share her incredible journey in her first Barbara Walters interview, aired at a time when the public was much less knowledgeable or accepting of the transgender community. This groundbreaking interview was followed over the years by other high-profile interviews, a documentary, the launch of her YouTube channel, a picture book, and her own reality TV series—I Am Jazz—making her one of the most recognizable activists for transgender teens, children, and adults. In her remarkable memoir, Jazz reflects on these very public experiences and how they have helped shape the mainstream attitude toward the transgender community. But it hasn't all been easy. Jazz has faced many challenges, bullying, discrimination, and rejection, yet she perseveres as she educates others about her life as a transgender teen. Through it all, her family has been beside her on this journey, standing together against those who don't understand the true meaning of tolerance and unconditional love. Now Jazz must learn to navigate the physical, social, and emotional upheavals of adolescence—particularly high school—complicated by the unique challenges of being a transgender teen.

Bloodstains,,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Crime']","For decades English investigators have been convinced that one, or two, or the Jack Ripper murders were committed by an American surgeon in London. Maybe they were right. The story of the author's great-great grandfather, Herman Webster Mudgett. History knows him as the infamous serial killer, H. H. Holmes.Bloodstains is the startling tale of one man’s search for the truth after inheriting the personal diaries belonging to his great-great-grandfather who he discovers was America’s first and most notorious serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett. Better known by his alias H.H. Holmes, Mudgett was the mass murderer who struck terror into the nation by being the proprietor of the infamous Murder Castle and stalking the streets of Chicago during the 1893 World’s Fair. During his incarceration awaiting execution, well over a century ago, Holmes admitted killing 27 innocent victims, but the evidence the author locates indicates hundreds more likely. From his investigation, Jeff Mudgett, the direct descendant, learns that Holmes’ reign of terror was worldwide and not limited to Chicago as has been so widely believed. Based upon never before revealed historical facts, Jeff pieces together a dynamic and extraordinary puzzle, including the strong possibility that Holmes was also Jack the Ripper.Far more than a documentary, Bloodstains is precariously balanced on the very edge between non-fiction and the paranormal, as the author’s research of his evil ancestor quickly takes on a personal aspect. Jeff soon fears his efforts may have awakened the legendary ‘Holmes Curse’ of the 1890s, the one investigated and written about by most of the nation’s major publications, including The New York Times. In fact, the deeper he digs into Holmes’ devilish past, the stronger the monster’s hold on him seems to become, testing the limits of his own sanity, as well as humanity. Racked by a mysterious and never before experienced epilepsy, Jeff suffers crippling grand mal seizures whenever he disobeys the haunting voices in his head. Finally, with nowhere else to turn, Jeff is forced to make the decisions of his genetic lifetime in a life-or-death struggle in order to win the greatest prize of all: his survival.

Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building.

Nobody gets inside her head, nobody gets inside her heart.  Silver is everything she's never wanted. He's a good guy, a smart guy, a guy who's never met a girl like her before. He's the kind of guy who loves history, who laughs at his own jokes, who kisses like a sinful dream. He's the kind of guy who might just break down her walls and get inside her heart and make her feel.  Too bad he's forbidden.  Because when Blair's mom dies and she's sent to live with the father she's never met and a family that doesn't want her, Blair and Silver cross paths in ways they never could have imagined, and they discover that even though they know they should, they can't quite bring themselves to stay apart.

Built to Last,Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,Business & Economics,"""This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies."" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.",,,,2004.0,,,0060566108,9780060566104,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRNtHbvDgRgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.98,,,,,,,,,368.0,,,49529.0,,,"['Jim Collins', 'Jerry I.

Being Dead,,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Death', 'Mystery', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Crime', 'Book Club']","Lying in the sand dunes of Baritone Bay are the bodies of a middle-aged couple. Celice and Joseph, in their mid-50s and married for more than 30 years, are returning to the seacoast where they met as students. Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, ""quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.""""Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell--just look at them--that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.""From that moment forward, Being Dead becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death.",,,,1999,[],Paperback,,9780312275426,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362225657l/92559.jpg,3.71,"['Whitbread Award Nominee for Novel (1999)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction (2000)']",284.0,4.0,,,,88.0,4584.0,196,Picador USA,"['1092', '1731', '1216', '418', '127']",,['United Kingdom'],,['Jim Crace']

Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'War', 'Religion', 'Terrorism', 'Islam', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Journalism']","Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Joby Warrick reveals how the strain of militant Islam now raising its banner across Iraq and Syria spread from a remote Jordanian prison with the unwitting aid of American military intervention.     When he succeeded his father in 1999, King Abdullah of Jordan released a batch of political prisoners in the hopes of smoothing his transition to power. Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East.     Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.     But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.      Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.From the Hardcover edition.",,,,September 29th 2015,['Abu Musab al-Zarqawi'],ebook,,9780385538220,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430514347l/25241317.jpg,4.34,['Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (2016)'],76.0,1.0,,,,98.0,11616.0,368,Doubleday,"['5505', '4845', '1080', '129', '57']",,[],,['Jowarrick']

Today would be her wedding anniversary. This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana’s childhood—in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not taken or perhaps displaced. “How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?” Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other. Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.  Blue Nights—the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice, “the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning”—like The Year of Magical Thinking before it, is an iconic book of incisive and electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.",,,,November 1st 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780307267672,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1319148558l/10252302.jpg,3.83,[],97.0,1.0,,,,91.0,24569.0,208,Knopf,"['6918', '9162', '6316', '1732', '441']",,[],,['Joan Didion']

"Beautiful Outlaw: Experiencing the Playful, Disruptive, Extravagant Personality of Jesus",,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Spirituality', 'Christianity', 'Christian Living', 'Theology', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Inspirational']","Reading the Gospels without knowing the personality of Jesus is like watching television with the sound turned off. The result is a dry, two dimensional person doing strange, undecipherable things. In BEAUTIFUL OUTLAW, John Eldredge removes the religious varnish to help readers discover stunning new insights into the humanity of Jesus. He was accused of breaking the law, keeping bad company, heavy drinking. Of being the devil himself. He was so compelling and dangerous they had to kill him. But others loved him passionately. He had a sense of humor. His generosity was scandalous. His anger made enemies tremble. He'd say the most outrageous things. He was definitely not the Jesus of the stained glass. In the author's winsome, narrative approach, he breaks Jesus out of the typical stereotypes, just as he set masculinity free in his book, Wild at Heart. By uncovering the real Jesus, readers are welcomed into the rich emotional life of Christ. All of the remarkable qualities of Jesus burst like fireworks with color and brilliance because of his humanity. Eldredge goes on to show readers how they can experience this Jesus in their lives every day. This book will quicken readers' worship, and deepen their intimacy with Jesus.",,,01/01/11,October 12th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780892960880,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344271244l/12079560.jpg,4.33,[],100.0,1.0,,,,96.0,4122.0,240,FaithWords,"['2230', '1232', '503', '120', '37']",,[],,['John Eldredge']

In this masterful and revelatory work, O'Donohue encourages our greater intimacy with beauty and celebrates it for what it really is: a homecoming of the human spirit.

Of course you have -- we all have. Was it ever taken out of context? Written in the wake of some highly publicized school shootings, Big Mouth & Ugly Girl takes a look at the shock waves that emanate from an overheard comment muttered in sarcasm, and the overzealous reaction of the school and surrounding community that follows. High school junior Matt Donaghy is considered an okay guy. He gets good grades, writes for the school paper, is in the Drama Club, and is known for his witty, if immature, humor. Students and teachers seem to like him. But one day he says something that makes a few classmates think he's out to bomb the school. The school principal is notified, the police are called in, and rumors are abuzz. Even his buddies doubt his innocence, and none of the guys come forward in his defense. There is, however, someone else who overheard Matt's statement and understood his mocking intent. School renegade Ursula Riggs, or ""Ugly Girl"" as she refers to herself, doesn't know Matt very well but reveals what she heard and the context in which it was said -- even though her parents instruct her to mind her own business. But even if Ursula can help Matt clear up this misunderstanding, will life at Rocky River High School ever be the same again? In her first novel for young adults, acclaimed author Joyce Carol Oates delivers a striking story about friendship, family, community, support, betrayal, and self-confidence.

They own vast lands and profitable businesses, they employ their neighbors, and they influence the government. A prolific and eccentric group, they include several millionaires, a mass murderer, a spiritual seeker who climbs into the mountains looking for God, a wealthy noctambulist who dies of a chicken scratch.Bellefleur traces the lives of several generations of this unusual family. At its center is Gideon Bellefleur and his imperious, somewhat psychic, very beautiful wife, Leah, their three children (one with frightening psychic abilities), and the servants and relatives, living and dead, who inhabit the mansion and its environs. Their story offers a profound look at the world's changeableness, time and eternity, space and soul, pride and physicality versus love. Bellefleur is an allegory of caritas versus cupiditas, love and selflessness versus pride and selfishness.

Black-Eyed Susans,,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary']","For fans of Laura Lippman and Gillian Flynn comes an electrifying novel of stunning psychological suspense.I am the star of screaming headlines and campfire ghost stories.I am one of the four Black-Eyed Susans.The lucky one.   As a sixteen-year-old, Tessa Cartwright was found in a Texas field, barely alive amid a scattering of bones, with only fragments of memory as to how she got there. Ever since, the press has pursued her as the lone surviving “Black-Eyed Susan,” the nickname given to the murder victims because of the yellow carpet of wildflowers that flourished above their shared grave. Tessa’s testimony about those tragic hours put a man on death row.   Now, almost two decades later, Tessa is an artist and single mother. In the desolate cold of February, she is shocked to discover a freshly planted patch of black-eyed susans—a summertime bloom—just outside her bedroom window. Terrified at the implications—that she sent the wrong man to prison and the real killer remains at large—Tessa turns to the lawyers working to exonerate the man awaiting execution. But the flowers alone are not proof enough, and the forensic investigation of the still-unidentified bones is progressing too slowly. An innocent life hangs in the balance. The legal team appeals to Tessa to undergo hypnosis to retrieve lost memories—and to share the drawings she produced as part of an experimental therapy shortly after her rescue.   What they don’t know is that Tessa and the scared, fragile girl she was have built a  fortress of secrets. As the clock ticks toward the execution, Tessa fears for her sanity, but even more for the safety of her teenaged daughter. Is a serial killer still roaming free, taunting Tessa with a trail of clues? She has no choice but to confront old ghosts and lingering nightmares to finally discover what really happened that night.   Shocking, intense, and utterly original, Black-Eyed Susans is a dazzling psychological thriller, seamlessly weaving past and present in a searing tale of a young woman whose harrowing memories remain in a field of flowers—as a killer makes a chilling return to his garden.",,,,August 11th 2015,"['Tessa Cartwright', 'Charlie', 'Lydia Bell', 'William ""Bill"" James Hastings III', 'dr Joana Seger', 'Lucas', 'Terrell Darcy Goodwin']",Hardcover,,9780804177993,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431975016l/23746004._SY475_.jpg,3.77,['Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Nominee for Longlist (2016)'],96.0,1.0,,,,91.0,29328.0,354,Ballantine Books,"['6769', '12361', '7600', '1908', '690']",,['Texas (United States)'],,['Julia Heaberlin']

Bliss of the Celibate,,[],"In the book, ""Bliss Of The Celibate,"" author Julian Lee makes the point that we did not ""get expelled"" from the Garden Of Eden all in one day in the past. Rather, we continue to see ourselves pushed further away from the garden gradually, day by day, as we indulge in sexual sin. The ""expulsion"" keeps going on. For most it deepens each day that they read another news story about overpopulation and ecological destruction, and see their town grow less familiar, and less pleasant. But he emphasizes that the real ""fall"" doesn't occur through any materia-logical, exo-mechanical cause like ""human overpopulation."" That is only an exoteric corollary of the real process. The expulsion from Eden really originates at a metaphysical level of one's own body, as a consequence of ""vibratory pollution"" that fills the body when we commit sexual sin.

His razor sharp sixth sense allows him the freedom to explore the extrasensory messages coming at him like a derailed freight train.And when Benjamin finds a peculiar relic of a key in his grandmother’s garden shed, he could never know his world was about to change forever.There is local legend in the small town of Grandlochcheshire that has been passed down for a 100 years about the mysterious disappearance of the Chickering family, that trails on the coat tails of the equally shocking abduction of the children belonging to the owner of the Skeffington Union Rails. The circumstances that follow this notorious tale enter into the modern world of Benjamin and his two best mates. Annabel and Mathilda, two sisters who have moved to Grandlochcheshire from America, have become more than mere friends to Benjamin, they have all become the three Muskydeers (Mathilda’s mispronounced version of Musketeers, which was a huge laugh and of course it stuck), as they are plunged head first into this curious journey. In the Gilley Forest they discover that the path they have chosen is inundated with many obstacles as well as intrigue. Alliances are made with the Forest clan of Gnomes and with the aid of the Vila sisters, the three friends take on the test that is the Grandfather Tree. They must stay on the pre ordained Path of Prophecy, whose ancestry comes from the home of the oldest living beings on the planet, the Elves of the Darmon. However, this is no easy task for the Muskydeers as they have the foulest of sorcery hunting their every move, the powerful dark beauty, Tar Vigorn…who will stop at nothing to gain entrance into the Great Tree.Through the Door and beneath the enchanted Gilley Forest lies the ever magical land of Coranim...a place of insight, thought and possibilities, with wondrous sites and magic galore. Once in Coranim the children make the acquaintance of the greatest Medicine Elder alive, Esmerelda Fet. A most powerful Light Sorceress with a brazen in your face attitude, and a thick Irish brogue, who guides the trio on their Path of destiny. However, dear reader, a path can change in the blink of an eye.",Benjamin McTish #1,,,July 2013,[],Paperback,,9780989646406,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369744691l/17984619.jpg,4.3,[],100.0,1.0,,,,92.0,37.0,388,Thornton Berry Shire Press,"['23', '7', '4', '1', '2']",,[],,['June M.

Beyond Tuesday Morning,,"['Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Inspirational', 'Christian Romance', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']","The hope-filled sequel to the bestselling One Tuesday Morning In this new novel by Karen Kingsbury, three years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York City. Jamie Bryan, widow of a firefighter who lost his life on that terrible day, has found meaning in her season of loss by volunteering at St. Paul’s, the memorial chapel across the street from where the Twin Towers once stood. Here she meets a daily stream of people touched by the tragedy, including two men with whom she feels a connection. One is a firefighter also changed by the attacks, the other a police officer from Los Angeles. But as Jamie gets to know the police officer, she is stunned to find out that he is the brother of Eric Michaels, the man with the uncanny resemblance to Jamie’s husband, the man who lived with her for three months after September 11. Eric is the man she has vowed never to see again. Certain she could not share even a friendship with his brother, Jamie shuts out the police officer and delves deeper into her work at St. Paul’s. Now it will take the persistence of a tenacious man, the questions from her curious young daughter, and the words from her dead husband’s journal to move Jamie beyond one Tuesday morning. “Jamie Bryan took her position at the far end of the Staten Island Ferry, pressed her body against the railing, eyes on the place where the Twin Towers once stood. She could face it now, every day if she had to. The terrorist attacks had happened, the World Trade Center had collapsed, and the only man she’d ever loved had gone down with them. Late fall was warmer than usual, and the breeze across the water washed over Jamie’s face. If she could do this, if she could make this journey three times a week while Sierra was in school, then she could convince herself to get through another long, dark night. She could face the empty place in the bed beside her, face the longing for the man who had been her best friend, the one she’d fallen for when she was only a girl.”",9/11 #2,,10/28/04,December 16th 2004,[],Paperback,,9780310257714,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440816802l/97863._SY475_.jpg,4.38,[],419.0,6.0,,,,97.0,9345.0,320,Zondervan,"['5214', '2775', '1120', '193', '43']",,[],,['Karen Kingsbury']

"Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity",,"['Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Asia', 'Poverty', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Sociology', 'Adult']","From Pulitzer Prize-winner Katherine Boo, a landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities.In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human. Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees ""a fortune beyond counting"" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter - Annawadi's ""most-everything girl"" - will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call ""the full enjoy."" But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi. With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.",,,,February 7th 2012,[],Hardcover,,9781400067558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315601232l/11869272.jpg,3.98,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2013)', 'National Book Award for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2012)', 'PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction (2013)', 'Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism (2013)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Current Interest (2012)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2012)', 'Ryszard Kapuściński Prize Nominee (2013)', 'NAIBA Book of the Year for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2012)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)']",404.0,5.0,,,,93.0,98620.0,278,Random House,"['33177', '39191', '19117', '5116', '2019']",,['Mumbai (India)'],,['Katherine Boo']

In a brilliantly realized tale of cat and mouse, the detective and the killer battle over the truth of the past and how events that led to the murder really unfolded. And if Kaga isn't able to uncover and prove why the murder was committed, then the truth may never come out.",Kyoichiro Kaga #4,,September 1996,May 23rd 2015,[],Paperback,,9783608980271,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431272495l/25516329.jpg,3.97,['Audie Award Nominee for Mystery (2015)'],16.0,1.0,,,,96.0,11623.0,255,Klett-Cotta,"['3203', '5418', '2553', '380', '69']",,[],,['Keigo Higashino']

Billy Liar On The Moon,,['Fiction'],"Keith Waterhouse's comic masterpiece Billy Liar (1959) introduced us to Billy Fisher, a seventeen-year-old undertaker's clerk whose inability to tell the truth led him into constant (and often hilarious) trouble with his parents, his employer, and his three girlfriends. It was a smash success, becoming a bestseller and winning widespread acclaim for both the novel and the classic film adaptation. In this 1975 sequel, Billy is thirty-three but still hasn't grown out of his propensity for lying. Stuck in a loveless marriage in a dismal town, where he has a dead-end job in local government, Billy seeks escape through his affair with Helen, who is also unhappily married. But once again he finds himself in danger of being undone by his lies: vodka martinis charged to his expense account, a wise-cracking alter ego named Oscar, a false police report about a stolen set of nonexistent golf clubs, an imaginary cat named 'Mr Pussy-paws' . . . Now the all-important town festival is approaching, but instead of doing the planning, Billy is busy trying to keep ahead of the suspicions of his wife, the police, and Helen's jealous husband. It all leads up to a disastrous and uproarious conclusion that The Times called 'side-achingly, laugh-aloud funny'.

Bless the Bees: The Pending Extinction of our Pollinators and What You Can Do to Stop It,,[],"Number one best selling book on Amazon in insects category, top 20 in environment and conservation since publication.""If the bee disappears from the earth, man would have no more than four years to live"" Albert Einstein.This beautifully illustrated edition is meant to educate the reader about the potential extinction of the bees as an indicator of a mass extinction, the last one of which was 65 million years ago. It explains what pollination is, who does it, why its essential to us, what things are threatening our pollinators and what we, as individuals, can do about it.They have been in existence for over 100 million years, but it has taken us less than 30 years to kill almost all of them off. Honey bees are responsible for pollinating 60% of the world's food supply. Without them, the human race would face starvation. A worldwide epidemic, it has been called the bee apocalypse by Russia's president, but it is worse in the United States than any other country. Since 1972, feral honey bees in the United States have declined 80% to near extinction, and domestic bees in the United States are down to 60%. Since 2006, the epidemic has been referred to as colony collapse disorder, describing the disappearance of entire colonies of bees.Among the causes cited for this disaster of epidemic proportions are parasites, the decrease in abundance and diversity of wildflowers, insecticides and genetically engineered foods (GMO's) that create their own synthetic pesticides which kill bees as well as other insects. But one thing is for certain-- mankind is responsible for the drastic decline in bee population and the United States government is doing nothing about it. On the contrary, the government has taken measures to make the problem worse.There is more to this delicate 100 million year old evolution of pollination that just honey bees, who were not native to the United States, but imported from Europe and probably originally came from Africa. At least 4,000 species of wild bees are known to exist in North America alone. All of them are at risk, and this book will show you how you can make a difference in saving them, our food supply, and our planet as we know it.50% of the royalties of this book will be donated to Bee Bay, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of bees and the environment.",,,,September 2nd 2013,[],Kindle Edition,,B00EYOG02A,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384959332l/18871297.jpg,4.22,[],98.0,1.0,,,,93.0,41.0,119,Amazon Digital Services,"['21', '11', '6', '3', '0']",,[],,"['Kenneth Eade', 'Valentina Eade']"

  Anita Blake is back in St. Louis and trying to live a normal life-as normal as possible for someone who is a legal vampire executioner and a U. S. Marshal. There are lovers, friends and their children, school programs to attend. In the midst of all the ordinary happiness a vampire from Anita's past reaches out. She was supposed to be dead, killed in an explosion, but the Mother of All Darkness is the first vampire, their dark creator. It's hard to kill a god. This dark goddess has reached out to her here-in St. Louis, home of everyone Anita loves most. The Mother of All Darkness has decided she has to act now or never, to control Anita, and all the vampires in America.  The Mother of All Darkness believes that the triumvirate created by master vampire Jean-Claude with Anita and the werewolf Richard Zeeman has enough power for her to regain a body and to immigrate to the New World. But the body she wants to possess is already taken. Anita is about to learn a whole new meaning to sharing her body, one that has nothing to do with the bedroom. And if the Mother of All Darkness can't succeed in taking over Anita's body for herself, she means to see that no one else has the use of it, ever again.

"Barbarians: How The Baby Boomers, Immigration, and Islam Screwed my Generation",,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'History', 'Islam', 'Far Right', 'American History', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Canada']","The values that built the west have been forgotten. Instead, millennials have been raised to hold hedonism above all. Whatever feels good goes. Freedoms and rights are things for legislators and judges to conjure out of thin air, not precious traditions forged in the crucible of history. Most millennials reject the nuclear family, and the religious values, that our culture was built on because they resemble some sort of “unenlightened” old world of responsibility and duty that millennials want no part in.  In short, squaring the truth about the West with the twisted values they’ve been brought up to swallow without complaint is not something that will be comfortable for many millennials. But I think that if not now, eventually most of them will take the plunge. Because deep down I think we know that what we’ve done is not empowering. Abandoning all guidance of our past and embracing hedonism and subjectivity was not some genius idea. Dismissing the guidance built for us over thousands and thousands of years in the form of gender roles, traditional lifestyles, hard work, objectivity, and cultural supremacy was, in fact, painfully stupid.  Because really, what have we got to show for it? Nothing but infinite license to put who and what we want in our bodies, while our freedoms to speak, to think, to dream, and to build get more limited every day. We’ve decided to fall backwards off the shoulders of giants, and that fall probably feels good, until you realize there’s going to be a “splat” at the end.  So with the ground of reality rushing up at them, more and more young people are clawing for anything to stop their feelings of personal, ethical, political, intellectual and artistic failure. And the rotted timber of progressivism is increasingly failing to break their fall. So eventually, they turn elsewhere.  And so, a steadily increasing number of millennials are finally beginning to wake up to the choice we face as a civilization, and to the value they’ve so long overlooked in traditional standards of morality and beauty. They are wondering: is modern culture really so great if it means we substitute Meghan Trainor for Mozart, Emma Sulkowicz for Da Vinci, or Bell Hooks for Plato? Is it really such a step forward that our civilization, which once shed both blood and ink debating Martin Luther’s 95 Theses, is now reduced to considering theses like VICE Magazine’s “Dear Straight Guys: It’s Time to Start Putting Things In Your Butt?” Is this all there is, or can we do better?  No, it isn’t, and yes, we can and must do better. Sure, it’ll be hard for us to dig ourselves out of the pit that the left-wing indoctrination and media machines has dug for everyone our age. But it’s work worth doing. Because right now, the world is on fire. And while my generation didn’t start the fire, with apologies to Billy Joel, I believe we have a chance to contain it, or even put it out.  But first we have to expose the frauds, liars, idiots, and above all, barbarians who threw gas on it.

Bringing Adam Home: The Abduction That Changed America,,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'Biography', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir']","There are two periods of history that pertain to missing and endangered children in the United States: before Adam Walsh, and after Adam Walsh. In the aftermath of that six-year old's abduction and slaying in 1981, everything about the nation's regard and response to missing children changed.The shock of the crime and the inability of law enforcement to find Adam's killer put an end to innocence, and altered our very perception of childhood itself - gone forever are the days when young children burst out the doors of American homes with a casual promise to be home by dark. And, due in large part to the efforts of Adam's parents, John and Reve Walsh, the entire mechanism of law enforcement has transformed itself in an effort to protect our children.Before Adam went missing, there were no children's faces on milk cartons and billboards, no Amber Alerts, no national Center for Missing and Abused Children, no national databases for crimes against children, no registration of pedophiles - in fact, it was easier to mobilize the FBI to search for a stolen car or missing horse than for a kidnapped child. Such facts may be sad testimony to the weariness of a modern world, but there is also an uplifting aspect to Adam's story - the 27 years of undaunted effort by decorated Miami Beach Homicide Detective, Joe Matthews, to track down Adam's killer and bring justice to bear at long last.Bringing Adam Home tells the story - the good, the bad, and the ugly - of what it took for one cop to accomplish what an entire system of law enforcement could not. Matthews' achievement is a stirring one, reminding us that such concepts as hard work, dedication, and love, survive, and that goodness can prevail.",,,,March 1st 2011,"['Gerard Schaefer', 'Ottis Toole', 'Henry Lee Lucas', 'Adam Walsh', 'John Walsh', 'Reve Walsh']",Hardcover,,9780061983900,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586660112l/9378740.jpg,3.9,[],96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,4415.0,291,Ecco,"['1402', '1592', '1084', '263', '74']",,[],,"['Les Standiford', 'Joe Matthews']"

Bad Blood,,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Legal Thriller', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'New York']","""Bad Blood"" finds Assistant DA Alexandra Cooper deeply involved in a complicated, high-profile homicide case. Defendant Brendan Quillian, a prominent young businessman, is charged with the brutal strangulation of his beautiful young wife, Amanda. His conviction is not a certainty: Quillian was conveniently out of town on the day of the killing, and he has hired a formidable defense attorney who seems one step ahead of Cooper as the trial opens. But with the help of detectives Mike Chapman and Mercer Wallace, she is confident she can prove Quillian paid a hit man to commit the crime.Halfway through the trial, a major catastrophe alters the course of Alex's case. A cataclysmic ex-plosion rips through New York City's Water Tunnel #3, a spectacular feat of modern engineering that will be completed years in the future. Carved through bedrock six hundred feet underground, the tunnel will replace a vital artery in the city's rapidly deteriorating water supply system. Was the blast caused by terrorism? Political retribution? Or was it merely an accident? Cooper is quickly drawn into the trag-edy when she discovers a strange connection linking Brendan Quillian to the tunnel workers killed in the explosion.At the same time, Alex meets a mysterious, handsome stranger. Should she get to know him better? Before the answer is clear, she is pulled back into the case, which is becoming more dangerous by the hour. She and Chapman descend deep into the earth to penetrate the subterranean universe of the sandhogs, as the brotherhood of tunnel workers are colorfully known. Their probe soon leads to another murder victim, whose blood may hold the key to Cooper's mesmerizingly complex case. One closelyheld secret reveals another, and soon Alex discovers that only by unraveling ancient rivalries among sandhog families will she be able to solve the murder of Amanda Quillian -- and save her own life as well.A riveting tale of up-to-the-minute urban intrigue, ""Bad Blood"" is rich with New York City lore and fascinating legal insights that only Fairstein, Manhattan's former sex crimes prosecutor, can deliver.

Greenhouse also paints the arc of Blackmun's lifelong friendship with Chief Justice Warren E.

And in Linda Howard’s red-hot novel Burn, the changes come fast, furious, and filled with the kind of sexy suspense, heart-stopping romance, beautiful people, and risky business guaranteed to give you the most bang for your buck.Money certainly changes Jenner Redwine’s life when she wins a lottery jackpot. But it also costs her plenty: Her father rips her off and disappears, her fortune-hunting boyfriend soon becomes her ex, and friends-turned-freeloaders give her the cold shoulder when she stops paying for everything.Flush with new money, Jenner can’t imagine ever finding a place in the world of the wealthy. Seven years later, though, she’s rubbing elbows with the rich, despite the fact she still feels like a party crasher. Luckily she finds an ally–-and a guide to the rarefied realm of privilege–-in shy, kind-hearted heiress Sydney Hazlett, who quickly becomes Jenner’s confidante and surrogate sister.When Sydney invites Jenner on a charity cruise aboard a luxury liner, Jenner reluctantly agrees. But while she’s expecting–-and dreading–-two weeks of masquerade balls, art auctions, and preening glitterati, what she gets is more like a Hitchcock movie than a Love Boat episode. Taken hostage by a menacing stranger, Jenner must cooperate in a mysterious cloak-and-dagger scheme-–or else. With nowhere to run, and with Sydney’s life as well as her own at risk, Jenner is drawn into a game of dizzying intrigue and harrowing danger.

However, though Potter is a household name around the world, few know the woman behind the illustrations. Her personal life, including a romantic relationship with her publisher, Norman Warne, and her significant achievements outside of children's literature remain largely unknown.

Bitchfest: Ten Years of Cultural Criticism from the Pages of Bitch Magazine,,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Gender Studies', 'Gender', 'Politics', 'Anthologies', 'Womens', 'Womens Studies', 'Pop Culture']","In the wake of Sassy and as an alternative to the more staid reporting of Ms. Magazine, Bitch was launched in the mid-nineties as a Xerox-and-staple zine covering the landscape of popular culture from a feminist perspective. Both unabashed in its love for the guilty pleasures of consumer culture and deeply thoughtful about the way the pop landscape reflects and impacts women's lives, Bitch grew to be a popular, full-scale magazine with a readership that stretched worldwide. Today it stands as a touchstone of hip, young feminist thought, looking with both wit and irreverence at the way pop culture informs feminism--and vice versa--and encouraging readers to think critically about the messages lurking behind our favorite television shows, movies, music, books, blogs, and the like. BITCHFest offers an assortment of the most provocative essays, reporting, rants, and raves from the magazine's first ten years, along with new pieces written especially for the collection. Smart, nuanced, cranky, outrageous, and clear-eyed, the anthology covers everything from a 1996 celebration of pre-scandal Martha Stewart to a more recent critical look at the ""gayby boom""; from a time line of black women on sitcoms to an analysis of fat suits as the new blackface; from an attempt to fashion a feminist vulgarity to a reclamation of female virginity.

Too bad she hasn t a clue that Colt s been head-over-bootheels in love with her from day one.After an unexpected, steamy interlude, all India can think about is riding the sexy cowboy instead of her motorcycle, even when Colt is determined to show her a slower ride is worth the wait.Or are they risking their friendship for a fling that could burn them both?""",Rough Riders #6,Nook,,March 2009,"['India Ellison', 'Colt McKay', 'Cameron McKay']",ebook,,9781605044583,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365992983l/6238846.jpg,4.29,[],74.0,1.0,,,,98.0,9561.0,298,"Samhain Publishing, Ltd","['4626', '3379', '1322', '180', '54']",,"['Sundance, Wyoming (United States)']",,['Lorelei James']

Birds of America,,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Literature', 'Womens', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'The United States Of America']","A long-awaited collection of stories--twelve in all--by one of the most exciting writers at work today, the acclaimed author of Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? and Self-Help. Stories remarkable in their range, emotional force, and dark laughter, and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.From the opening story, ""Willing"", about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago, where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being, Birds of America unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged, the lost, the unsettled of our America. In the story ""Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People"" (""There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being""), a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone, the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. In ""Charades,"" a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. In ""Community Life,""a shy, almost reclusive, librarian, Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred, moves in with her boyfriend, the local anarchist in a small university town, and all hell breaks loose. And in ""Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens,"" a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger, Denial, Bargaining, Haagen Dazs, Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents, the son she never had, Bosnia.In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane, with all the wit, brio, and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.",,,10/28/98,September 23rd 1999,[],Paperback,,9780312241223,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388641896l/19631.jpg,4.11,"['Salon Book Award (1998)', ""O.

In this suspenseful sequel to Crossing the Line, movie star Waverly Sinner has a gunshot wound and a missing fake boyfriend and the only man who can help her now is the one who broke her heart five years ago, Xavier Saint. When charming leading man Dante Wrede offered Waverly a new way to use her acting talents, she jumped at the chance. Undercover work is exciting and challenging. But when their assignment is cut short by a hail of gunfire, Waverly is left bleeding and alone with a cover story that could ruin her career.  It’s been five years since Waverly almost died because of a mistake he made. But when Xavier Saint catches the latest mess the actress has gotten herself into, he faces facts. He’s never stopped loving her and she still obviously needs his protection. But when he tracks her down in secluded paradise, it’s clear she’s not working on her issues in rehab as the media reported. And she’s definitely not happy to see him or willing to trust him with anything more than half-truths.  They have an attraction that won’t die, but without trust there’s no hope for a future together. The only shot Xavier has at winning her back is helping her find Dante Wrede, the man he thinks she loves. When a plot to frame her for kidnapping and murder materializes, their rag tag team of conspirators need to work fast and play dirty to clear her name. He’s got just one shot at proving her innocence and winning her back forever.  Author’s Note: This is the conclusion of Waverly and Xavier’s story that began with Crossing the Line.

Brought up in an affluent southern household, Delilah's life had been planned from the moment she was born. She was raised to be the perfect socialite and daughter, and groomed to be the ideal wife. When a school internship moved her to Sulfur Heights for the summer, Delilah collided with the bitter reality of life outside her comfortable gated community when Jake Evans upset her perfect world. Over the next two years, Jake and Delilah became best friends, embracing a friendship neither one was prepared to have, although they soon found it to be a relationship that neither one of them were willing to sacrifice. A tragic turn of events brings Jake and Delilah together once again. Only this time, the feelings are different. Lines within their friendship are blurred. Everything they vowed never to do, becomes the very thing they cannot deny. Will Jake and Delilah's relationship withstand the changes surrounding them? Or will the emotions sever the two year friendship they'd fought so hard to keep?",Sulfur Heights #3,,January 26th 2014,January 27th 2014,[],Paperback,,9781494735524,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393975663l/20714091.jpg,4.21,[],35.0,1.0,,,,95.0,798.0,332,CreateSpace,"['358', '292', '111', '29', '8']",,[],,['M.

Beijing Coma,,"['China', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'Asian Literature', 'Historical', 'Chinese Literature', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'Literature']","Dai Wei has been unconscious for almost a decade. A medical student and a pro-democracy protestor in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, he was struck by a soldier’s bullet and fell into a deep coma. As soon as the hospital authorities discovered that he had been an activist, his mother was forced to take him home. She allowed pharmacists access to his body and sold his urine and his left kidney to fund special treatment from Master Yao, a member of the outlawed Falun Gong sect. But during a government crackdown, the Master was arrested, and Dai Wai’s mother—who had fallen in love with him—lost her mind. As the millennium draws near, a sparrow flies through the window and lands on Dai Wei’s naked chest, a sign that he must emerge from his coma. But China has also undergone a massive transformation while Dai Wei lay unconscious. As he prepares to take leave of his old metal bed, Dai Wei realizes that the rich, imaginative world afforded to him as a coma patient is a startling contrast with the death-in-life of the world outside. At once a powerful allegory of a rising China, racked by contradictions, and a seminal examination of the Tiananmen Square protests, Beijing Coma is Ma Jian’s masterpiece.

Bee Thousand,,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Pop Culture']","Marc Woodworth's book covers the album's long and unorthodox period of writing, recording, sequencing, and editing. It includes interviews with members of the band, manager Pete Jamison, web-master and Guided by Voices historian Rich Turiel and Robert Griffin of Scat Records. At least sixty-five songs were recorded and considered for the album and five distinct concepts were rejected before the band hit upon the records final form. One late version, very nearly released, contained only a few of ""Bee Thousand's"" definitive songs. The rest were left out and nearly ended up in the boxes of cassette out-takes cluttering up Robert Pollard's basement. The story of Guided By Voices' transformation from an occasional and revolving group of complete unknowns to indie-rock heroes is very much part of the story behind the making of ""Bee Thousand."" In addition to providing a central account of how the record was made, Woodworth devotes a substantial chapter to the album's lyrics.

Belong to Me,,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Family', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Marriage', 'Relationships', 'Novels']","Everyone has secrets. Some we keep to protect ourselves, others we keep to protect those we love.A devoted city dweller, Cornelia Brown surprised no one more than herself when she was gripped by the sudden, inescapable desire to leave urban life behind and head for an idyllic suburb. Though she knows she and her beloved husband, Teo, have made the right move, she approaches her new life with trepidation and struggles to forge friendships in her new home. Cornelia's mettle is quickly tested by judgmental neighbor Piper Truitt. Perfectly manicured, impeccably dressed, and possessing impossible standards, Piper is the embodiment of everything Cornelia feared she would find in suburbia. A saving grace soon appears in the form of Lake. Over a shared love of literature and old movies, Cornelia develops an instant bond with this warm yet elusive woman who has also recently arrived in town, ostensibly to send her perceptive and brilliant son, Dev, to a school for the gifted.Marisa de los Santos's literary talents shine in the complex interactions she creates between these three women. She deftly explores the life-altering roller coaster of emotions Piper faces as she cares for two households, her own and that of her cancer-stricken best friend, Elizabeth. Skillfully, de los Santos creates an enigmatic and beguiling character in Lake, who draws Cornelia closer even as she harbors a shocking secret. And from the first page until the exhilarating conclusion, de los Santos engages readers with Cornelia, who, while trying to adapt to her new surroundings, must remain true to herself.

But not many know of his past, of a tormented youth, which almost saw him take his own life. For ten years he's lived with the nightmares of his stepfather raping him, and how it destroyed his family. Further tormented by his first love leaving him, he tries to move forward with his new partner Beth, but is unable to open up to her, his past continuing to eat away at his soul.Beth knows Ash is keeping her in the dark, and every word he doesn't say, every secret he keeps, pushes her further into his brother's arms, someone who doesn't understand boundaries, a trait that has given Dante a wild reputation: the man every woman wants to bed. Hedonistic and uncontrollable, Dante desires Beth to the point of madness, his bipolar condition worsening with the stress of his hidden desires. He wants to control her, to take her, but he is deeply reliant on Ash, and like his brother, he hides his true nature. On the outside he shows a confident swagger that gets him the attention of both sexes, but on the inside all he wants is one woman who sees him as more than a sexual object.Sledge, the youngest of the three Rata brothers, finds himself in a different situation, dealing with the affections of his best friend: Beth's brother Corey. Diagnosed with cancer, Corey wants Sledge more than life itself, even though he believes Sledge is homophobic and would find him disgusting if he confessed his love. But when another man shows interest in Corey, Sledge's jealousy eats away at him, and makes him reassess his sexuality, and whether he could be more than a friend to Corey - whether he could be his lover.As the Rata family's love life is thrown into tangles, the brothers' stepfather escapes from prison with one thing on his mind: To get Ash once again. Someone he will kill for - and has killed for.(R18)Author's Note: Book 2 has different main characters from book 1. Due to this, you don't need to read book 1 to understand this story.

Bee Time: Lessons from the Hive,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Biology', 'Environment', 'Memoir', 'Gardening', 'Canada', 'Food']","Being among bees is a full-body experience, Mark Winston writes--from the low hum of tens of thousands of insects and the pungent smell of honey and beeswax, to the sight of workers flying back and forth between flowers and the hive. The experience of an apiary slows our sense of time, heightens our awareness, and inspires awe. Bee Time presents Winston's reflections on three decades spent studying these creatures, and on the lessons they can teach about how humans might better interact with one another and the natural world.Like us, honeybees represent a pinnacle of animal sociality. How they submerge individual needs into the colony collective provides a lens through which to ponder human societies. Winston explains how bees process information, structure work, and communicate, and examines how corporate boardrooms are using bee societies as a model to improve collaboration. He investigates how bees have altered our understanding of agricultural ecosystems and how urban planners are looking to bees in designing more nature-friendly cities.The relationship between bees and people has not always been benign. Bee populations are diminishing due to human impact, and we cannot afford to ignore what the demise of bees tells us about our own tenuous affiliation with nature. Toxic interactions between pesticides and bee diseases have been particularly harmful, foreshadowing similar effects of pesticides on human health. There is much to learn from bees in how they respond to these challenges.

Betrayal of Justice,,"['Drama', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary']","This very topical, controversial, and prophetic novel is set in Washington D.C. and Dearborn, Michigan. In Washington D.C., a newly-elected president promises, in his inaugural speech, to “make America pure again.” In Dearborn, Michigan, a young Muslim woman, Arya Khan, watches President John’s acceptance speech in horror while a a few miles away, a white supremacist, Keith Blackwell, watches the same speech with pure joy. Inspired by the new president's rhetoric, Blackwell fire bombs a local mosque. The Dearborn Police promise to investigate, but Arya fears that these cops are indifferent to the Muslim community and will not vigorously investigate. She takes matters into her own hands and conducts her own 'private investigation'. Arya identifies a suspect, follows him, and witnesses his brutal murder. She calls 9-1-1 and rushes to render aid, but when the police arrive, all evidence points to Arya as the murderer; she’s arrested, jailed and formally charged.When the news story reaches the president, he seeks to deport Arya's immigrant parents. Zachary Blake (the central character of Bello’s debut legal thriller, Betrayal of Faith) returns as the trial lawyer for the family and drama plays out in both criminal and immigration courtrooms. But as the Dearborn Police seek to complete their investigation, an organization of white supremacists tries to thwart any attempt to tie their group to the murder and mayhem. Can Zachary Blake and his crack private investigator, Micah Love, save Aria from a murder charge and her parents from deportation? Can this innocent family expect justice in this new, ""pure"" America, an America that has lost its way?Betrayal of Justice is the second installment of the Zachary Blake Betrayal Legal Thriller Series by attorney/author Mark M.

Betrayal In Blue,,"['Contemporary', 'Drama', 'Novels', 'Epic']","“Cut off the head of the snake and another will grow in its place.”  Part crime drama, part legal thriller, Betrayal in Blue follows the return of Zachary Blake and Jack Dylan as they fight law enforcement itself in picturesque Manistee, Michigan.  Following its triumph over white supremacists in the field and in the courtroom, law enforcement in the city of Dearborn, Michigan has enjoyed relative tranquility. Unfortunately, not for long, as a second (and more dangerous) syndicate and its leader plot revenge for their fallen brothers. Their scheme? To steal and release deadly Sarin gas in the city.  Police Captain Jack Dylan and his team are dedicated to thwarting the plot and bringing the culprits to justice. However, with a terrorist threat in play, the FBI usurps the investigation. However, Jack Dylan never backs away from a case or a fight. When the white supremacy leader evades the FBI's dragnet, Jack goes rogue and hunts him down in Manistee.  The inevitable standoff finds Dylan alone with his nemesis in an unfamiliar city with no FBI or local law enforcement to support him. His plans go awry, and Jack finds himself arrested by local authorities and placed on trial for his actions.  Attorney Zachary Blake comes to his defense in the biggest trial this quiet community has ever seen. The local cops and the FBI think they have a winner, but Zack and his lead investigator, Micah Love, believe there’s more to the story than meets the eye.

      Evvy Hoffmeister is thirteen years old when her family brings her to Loon Lake Sanatorium to get cured of tuberculosis (TB). Evvy is frightened by her new surroundings; the rules to abide are harsh and the nurses equally rigid. But Evvy soon falls into step with the other girls in her ward. There’s Sarah, quiet but thoughtful; Pearl, who adores Hollywood glamour; and Dena, whose harshness conceals a deep strength. Together, the girls brave the difficult daily routines. Set in 1940 at a time of political unrest throughout the U.S. and Europe, this thought-provoking novel sheds light on a much-feared worldwide illness. Hundreds of thousands of people died each year of TB, and many ill children were sent away to sanatoriums to hopefully recover.
      This is a masterful novel—both eloquent and moving—that gives voice to those who fought hard to overcome the illness.

Black Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook', 'Management', 'Science']","An eye-opening, Gladwellian look at the power of a positive attitude toward failure and its profound impact on our success in any field.In the airline industry, failure is taken seriously. Every aircraft is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. When there is an accident, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and the reason for the accident excavated. This ensures that procedures are adapted so that the same mistake doesn’t happen again. With this method, the industry has created an astonishing safety record.For pilots working in a safety-critical industry, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. But most of us have a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our lives. We don’t acknowledge it or learn from it —though we often think we do.Moving from anthropology to psychology and from history to complexity theory, Matthew Syed explains why even when we think we have 20/20 hindsight, our vision’s still fuzzy. He offers a radical new idea: that the most important determinant of success in any field, whether sports, business, or life, is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. This is how we learn, progress and excel. This approach explains everything from biological evolution and the efficiency of markets to the success of the Mercedes F1 team and the mindset of David Beckham.Using a cornucopia of interviews, gripping stories, and sharp-edged science, Syed explores the intimate relationship between failure and success, and shows why we need to transport black box thinking into our own lives. If we wish to unleash our potential, we must diagnose and break free of our failures.

"Beers, Hens and Irishmen",,"['Romance', 'Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'Contemporary Romance']","Fiona O’Leary wants nothing more than to flee away from the small town she grew up in, her three extremely over protective brothers, and her Irish parents. But leaving Warblers Point is not that simple, especially when she is the bar maid at the local pub she owns with her three brothers. After a two year relationship with local Irishman, Murphy Ryan, sharing nothing but each other’s beds, she realizes she wants more out of a relationship besides sex. But somehow she keeps winding up in his arms wishing she could break away but finds the task impossible when her family is head over heels in love of the idea of Murphy and Fiona together. Booker Hall, world re-known director, finds himself living an empty and unfulfilled life. The people around him are fake, narcissistic and only care about his money. In an act of desperation he decides to enlist his sister for some help, give himself a makeover and go to a place where no one would recognize him. Never did he think he was going to fall in love with an unsuspecting bar maid with whiskey colored eyes and an over-bearing family. The minute Fiona lays eyes on Booker, she knows she is sunk. His devilish grin, movie star looks and charming heart are hard to avoid and she constantly finds herself gravitating toward him. The only bad thing about Booker is that he is a tourist and living in a touristy town she has learned that getting involved with a non-local only brings heartache. Instead of giving into Booker, she finds herself debating which relationship is safer; an empty relationship but fulfilling sex life with Murphy or a deep and meaningful relationship with Booker that could only bring heartache. Beers, Hens and Irishmen dives into the complexity of Fiona’s love life, the crazy antics of her three brothers, as well as her two overbearing and heavily Irish speaking parents.

Moving to the capital city of Haven rips him away from his friends and boyhood pleasures, and nothing in Haven seems to fill that void. Unable to fit into the nouveau riche society, and unwilling to follow his parents into the textile guild, he finds himself adrift and depressed. His father enrolls him in a special school that will allow him to choose a trade that interests him, rather than be apprenticed against his will. There he finds himself terrorized and tortured by the boys in the sixth form until, with an awful roar, the gift of fire awakens deep within him and extracts revenge for his sadistic treatment.With the help of a unique herald, an empathetic healer and a special companion, Lavan soon learns to keep his gift under control and eventually, to direct his awful firestorm as far as he can see. When the kingdom of Karse attacks, Lavan is hurried to the border to assist his king and country by repelling the invasion.

The company also sent along a new employee to guard its treasure. He was Jeronimus Corneliszoon, a disgraced and bankrupt man with great charisma and dangerously heretical ideas. With the help of a few disgruntled sailors, he hatched a plot to seize the ship and her riches. The mutiny might have succeeded, but in the dark morning hours of June 3, 1629, the Batavia smashed through a coral reef and ran aground on a small chain of islands near Australia. The captain and skipper escaped the wreck, and in a tiny lifeboat they set sail for Java—some 1,500 miles north—to summon help. More than 250 frightened survivors waded ashore, thankful to be alive.

Buddha's Warriors,,"['History', 'China', 'Buddhism', 'Nonfiction', 'Asia', 'War']","Buddha's Warriors is the first book that brings to life Tibet before the Chinese communist invasions and depicts the transition of peaceful monks to warriors with the help of the CIA. Tibet in the last sixty years has been so much mystified and politicized that the world at large is confused about what really happened to the ""Rooftop of the World"" when Mao Tse-tung invaded its borders in 1950. There are dramatically conflicting accounts from Beijing and Dharamsala (home of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile). Adding to the confusion is the romanticized spin that Western writers and filmmakers have adopted in an effort to appease the popular myth of Shangri-La.Buddha's Warriors is no fairy tale. Set in a narrative framework but relying heavily on the oral transcripts of the Tibetan men who actually fought the Chinese, Buddha's Warriors tells, for the first time, the inside story of these historic developments, while drawing a vivid picture of Tibetan life before, during, and after Mao's takeover. The firsthand accounts, gathered by the author over a period of seven years, bring faces and deeply personal emotions to the forefront of this ongoing tragedy. It is a saga of brave soldiers and cowardly traitors. It's about hope against desolation, courage against repression, atheism against Buddhism. Above all, it's about what happens to an ancient civilization when it is thrust overnight into the modern horrors of twentieth-century warfare.",,,,December 29th 2004,[],Hardcover,,9781585423484,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203997l/406853.jpg,4.38,[],99.0,1.0,,,,95.0,104.0,433,Tarcher,"['57', '36', '6', '4', '1']",,[],,"['Mikel Dunham', 'Dalai Lama XIV']"

The newly formed group plans to travel west, find a boat and maybe, with a bit of luck, make it back to America. Cale is tested beyond his imagination and brought to the brink of insanity as he loses friends while fighting the flesh eating masses. He risks his life for weeks, focused on holding his wife and daughter in his arms again. It seems all hope is lost when he finds himself alone and adrift at sea ... but is hope really lost? Inspired by my experiences as a U.S. Army Soldier in Iraq, BLOOD ON THE SAND delves into the idea of not just surviving a zombie apocalypse but making the seemingly impossible trek home.

Bengal Nights,A Novel,Fiction,"Set in 1930s Calcutta, this is a roman á clef of remarkable intimacy. Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent. Offered the hospitality of a senior Indian colleague, Alain grasps at the chance to discover the authentic India firsthand. He soon finds himself enchanted by his host's daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain's thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story, Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man's self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade's story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade's life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. ""Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant, written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter. It is enough to make stones weep."" — Literary Review Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works, as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal, are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950, Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success. The film, Les Nuits Bengali, appeared in 1987.",,,,1995.0,,,0226204197,9780226204192,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n_oVTyKx7mcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.93,,,,,,,,,184.0,,,245.0,,,['Mircea Eliade']

With great poignancy, Ali illuminates a foreign world; her well-developed characters pull readers along on a deeply psychological, almost spiritual journey. Through the eyes of two Bangladeshi sisters—the plain Nazneen and the prettier Hasina—we see the divergent paths of the contemporary descendants of an ancient culture. Hasina elopes to a ""love marriage,"" and young Nazneen, in an arranged marriage, is pledged to a much older man living in London. Ali's skillful narrative focuses on Nazneen's stifling life with her ineffectual husband, who keeps her imprisoned in a city housing project filled with immigrants in varying degrees of assimilation. But Ali reveals a bittersweet tension between the ""two kinds of love"" Nazneen and her sister experience—that which begins full and overflowing, only to slowly dissipate, and another which emerges like a surprise, growing unexpectedly over years of faithful commitment. Both of these loves have their own pitfalls: Hasina's passionate romance crumbles into domestic violence, and Nazneen's marriage never quite reaches a state of wedded bliss.Though comparisons have drawn between Ali and Zadie Smith, a better comparison might be made between this talented newcomer and the work of Amy Tan, who so deftly portrays the immigrant experience with empathy and joy.",,,05/31/03,June 2nd 2004,[],Paperback,,9780743243315,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433730686l/18723.jpg,3.42,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2003)', 'Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2004)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2003)', 'Orwell Prize Nominee (2004)', 'Audie Award for Fiction, Abridged (2004)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2003)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Fiction (2004)']",258.0,3.0,,,,84.0,28207.0,432,Scribner,"['3960', '9788', '9833', '3456', '1170']",,[],,['Monica Ali']

Life was absurd, and nobody truly understood anybody else. Even his friends tend to agree that Barney is a 'wife-abuser, an intellectual fraud, a purveyor of pap, a drunk with a penchant for violence and probably a murderer'. But when his sworn enemy threatens to publish this calumny, Barney is driven to write his own memoirs, rewinding the spool of his life, editing, selecting and plagiarising, as his memory plays tricks on him - and on the reader. Ebullient and perverse, he has seen off 3 wives - the enigmatic Clara, whom he drove to suicide in Paris in 1952; the garrulous Second Mrs Panofsky; and finally Miriam who stayed married to him for decades before running off with a sober academic. Houdini-like, Barney slides from crisis to success, from lowlife to highlife in Montreal, Paris and London, his outrageous expolits culminating in the scandal he carries around like a humpback - the murder charge that he goes on denying to the end.",,,10/28/97,September 25th 1997,[],Hardcover,,9780701162726,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328806227l/196564.jpg,4.16,"['Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal (1998)', 'Scotiabank Giller Prize (1997)', ""Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book in Caribbean and Canada (1998)"", ""Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize Nominee (1997)"", 'Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Nominee for Fiction (1998)', 'Premi Llibreter de narrativa for Altres literatures (2013)']",437.0,5.0,,,,94.0,10012.0,416,Chatto Windus,"['4368', '3608', '1469', '368', '199']",,[],,['Mordecai Richler']

The series begins with TURNED (Book #1), which is now a free download!  In BETROTHED (Book #6 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb find themselves, once again, back in time—this time, in the London of 1599.  London in 1599 is a wild place, filled with paradoxes: while on the one hand it is an incredibly enlightened, sophisticated time, breeding playwrights like Shakespeare, on the other, it is also barbaric and cruel, with daily public executions, torture, and heads of prisoners impaled on spikes. It is also a time of superstition and grave public danger, with a lack of sanitation, and the Bubonic Plague spreading in the streets, carried by rats.  In this environment Caitlin and Caleb land, on the search for her father, for the third key, for the mythical shield that can save humankind. Their mission takes them through a whirlwind of London’s most amazing medieval architecture, through the British countryside’s most breathtaking castles. It takes them back into the heart of London, where they just might meet Shakespeare himself, and see one of his plays live. It brings them to a little girl, Scarlet, who just might become their daughter. And all the while, Caitlin’s love for Caleb deepens, as finally they are together—and as Caleb might just finally find the perfect time, and place, to propose to her.  Sam and Polly have traveled back, too, and as they find themselves stuck together on their own journey, their relationship deepens, as they each, despite themselves, can’t help feeling more deeply for each other.  But all is not well. Kyle has come back, too, as has his evil sidekick, Sergei, and they are both intent on destroying everything good in Caitlin’s life. It will be a race to the finish, as Caitlin is forced to make some of the hardest decisions of her life if she is to save everyone who is dear to her, save her relationship with Caleb—and try to make it out alive.

Banker to the Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle Against World Poverty,,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Poverty', 'Finance', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'International Development', 'Social Justice', 'Asia']","Muhammad Yunus is that rare thing: a bona fide visionary. His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long."" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business.  Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit.",,,10/30/91,October 16th 2003,[],Paperback,,9781586481988,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1284082691l/27533.jpg,4.1,[],181.0,2.0,,,,96.0,9204.0,289,PublicAffairs,"['3361', '3847', '1642', '291', '63']",,[],,"['Muhammad Yunus', 'Alan Jolis']"

But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness. In this altered reality, Saul inducts her into his hallowed study and lavishes upon her the attention previously reserved for Aaron, who in his displacement embarks upon a lone quest for spiritual fulfillment. When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family.

With a forceful and compassionate voice, Pizzolatto finds beauty in loneliness as his characters attempt to bridge the gulfs between themselves and others, past and present, and, sometimes, between their inner and outer selves. In this both heartbreaking and humorous collection, we meet a base-jumping, samurai park ranger who parachutes off the St. Louis Arch; a stained glass artist who struggles over his masterpiece and learns through great loss what his true subject will be; and a religious elementary school teacher who tries to understand her rebellious, militant son. In the title story, which first appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, an orphaned young man and his former high school football coach set out to kidnap the coach’s daughter from Los Angeles and bring her back to east Texas. With an assured, poignant voice, Pizzolatto places us at the crossroads of memory and desire, somewhere between here and the Yellow Sea. ",,,05/16/06,January 15th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,9781596921689,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391480535l/8623763.jpg,3.73,[],56.0,1.0,,,,91.0,1133.0,275,MP Publishing Limited,"['233', '478', '318', '86', '18']",,[],,['Nic Pizzolatto']

Becoming a Superhero: Based on a True Story,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir']","Oliver was a lost child. Even though he had a good background, he managed to screw up his life. He was a military brat. His father served 24 years in the US Navy. His mom was loving and kind, but very strict. Maybe too much discipline was too much for him?He also had a good education. He was taught in DoDDs (Department of Defense Dependents Schools), similar to private schools, in Portugal and Panama. He even earned a bachelor's degree in Business Management from the renown San Diego State University. However, after all that, it was all downhill.Oliver was a nerd. And he was determined to become a superhero to prove to all the bullies wrong. He worked out hard, even up to five hours a day. He told his psychologist that the reason why he worked out so hard was so he could become a triathlete. However, his real goal was to become a superhero.Unfortunately, Oliver took a wrong path in life. He got mixed up in women, money, and gambling. He had a theory: To think like a criminal, you must act like a criminal.See the adventures of our young superhero as he turns his life around....Chapter 1: BackgroundI was born in the summer of 1974, in a small town near New Orleans, Louisiana. I had big ears, big eyes and a flat nose. I was a scrawny little boy. I’m sure if I was born from Spartan parents, I would’ve easily been thrown off a cliff, as I would’ve been denounced unfit enough to be a Spartan. Luckily, my parents decided to keep me.My parents bestowed upon me the name, “Oliver.” Like Oliver Twist? Yes. However, my name didn’t come from a play. It came from a movie called Love Story. It was my parent’s favorite movie back in 1974, and starred Ryan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw. In this movie, Ryan O’Neal played a character named Oliver. Oliver was an intelligent and handsome guy. Unfortunately, my story is a little different.My dad was a cook or MS (Mess Specialist) in the US Navy. He was an enlisted man, not an officer. He always told me, “If you ever join the military, then become an officer. Don’t be enlisted like me.” He was rather intelligent. However, the only job he could get back then was a cook.You see, in 1947, the US had a huge base called Subic Bay in the Philippines. The US signed a Status of Forces agreement which required the United States to hire Filipinos. Out of the thousands of Filipinos who took the test, my dad was one of the very few who passed it and was recruited into the US Navy. Of course, the only jobs the US allowed the Filipinos to take were cooks. That’s why you will see a lot of old Filipino cooks in the Navy.My dad had a hard life in the Philippines. He used to tell me every day how lucky I was to be born in America. He used to tell me how he collected coins in the ditches and cans on the street to support his family. He told me several times that if he hadn’t passed that test, I would’ve been collecting cans too.I knew I was very fortunate. However, I used to joke around with him all the time saying, “Did it snow in the Philippines too?”He used to get mad at me all the time for saying that. He would always say that it was no laughing matter. Although I apologized many times, I still didn’t believe he walked ten miles to school and back…barefoot! All joking aside, I knew he had a hard life in the Philippines. With that being said, I just wanted to say that I am truly proud to be an American. I couldn’t imagine my life otherwise…much less collecting cans in the ditches.However, although I am an American, I am also known as a Second Generation Filipino, meaning my parents were born in the Philippines and I was born here, in the US. Luckily I was born here, in the US, because if I was born in the Philippines, I would’ve been considered very poor. And even though I’m Filipino…I don’t speak the “Tagalog” language.",,,,October 4th 2012,[],Paperback,,9781479231188,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349954857l/16080113.jpg,3.82,[],42.0,1.0,,,,84.0,97.0,282,,"['38', '25', '18', '11', '5']",,[],,['Oliver Galang']

Assim como em outros livros de Ondjaki, o mundo dos jovens e a descoberta da vida adulta e seus conflitos são retratados sem o tom irritadiço das militâncias nem a condescendência do lirismo excessivo. E Bom dia, camaradas é daqueles romances que atravessa as idades e pode ser lido tanto pelo jovem quanto pelo leitor maduro. A literatura de Ondjaki é especialmente atraente para o público brasileiro, que verá a língua portuguesa ganhar outros contornos e reconhecerá no escritor angolano muito da nossa melhor tradição literária.",,,10/30/03,January 20th 2014,[],Paperback,,9788535923766,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389457607l/20511904.jpg,3.82,[],96.0,1.0,,,,94.0,526.0,136,Companhia das Letras,"['120', '222', '154', '27', '3']",,[],,['Ondjaki']
"Blackamoores: Africans in Tudor England, Their Presence, Status and Origins",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Anti Racist', 'Historical', 'World History', 'British Literature', 'Cultural', 'Research', 'European History']","Do we imagine English history as a book with white pages and no black letters in? We sometimes think of Tudor England in terms of gaudy costumes, the court of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I and perhaps Shakespearian romance. Onyeka's book acknowledges this predilection but challenges our perceptions. Onyeka's book is about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England. In it Onyeka argues that these people were present in cities and towns throughout England, but that they did not automatically occupy the lowest positions in Tudor society. This is important because the few modern historians who have written about Africans in Tudor England suggest that they were all slaves, or transient immigrants who were considered as dangerous strangers and the epitome of otherness. However, this book will show that some Africans in England had important occupations in Tudor society, and were employed by powerful people because of the skills they possessed. These people seem to have inherited some of their skills from the multicultural societies that they came from, but that does not mean all of those present in England were born in other countries: some were born in England. The arguments in this book are supported by evidence from a variety of sources both manuscript and printed, most of which has not been widely discussed - whilst some of it Onyeka has discovered, and this may be the first time that it has been revealed. Other evidence is taken from texts that are the subject of popular discussion by historians, linguists and so on, but Onyeka encourages the reader to re-examine these works in a different way because they reveal information about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England.",,1,10/28/13,September 16th 2013,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384945566l/18869947.jpg,4.35,[],800.0,8.0,,,,95.0,80.0,463,Narrative Eye Ltd,"['47', '20', '9', '2', '2']",,['England'],,['Onyeka']

"Belief, Doubt, and Fanaticism: Is It Essential to Have Something to Believe In?",,['Philosophy'],"One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century addresses the conflicts that arise between people with opposing views and the dangers of losing your individual identity in your desire to belong to a group with shared values.In Belief, Doubt, and Fanaticism: Is It Essential to Have Something to Believe In?, Osho brings his unique and often surprising perspective to the religious, political, social and economic forces that drive people into opposing camps, fanatical groups, and belief systems that depend on seeing every ""other"" as the ""enemy."" As always, the focus is first and foremost on the individual psyche and consciousness, to identify the root causes and hidden demons of our human need to belong and have something to ""believe in.""Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India.

Banvard's Folly,Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change the World,History,"The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins' Banvard's Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as ""The Three Mile Painting"") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed ""William Shakespeare"" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins' love for what he calls the ""forgotten ephemera of genius"" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard's Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.",,,,2002.0,,,0312300336,9780312300333,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSv6w5Ba2Y4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.97,,,,,,,,,320.0,,,498.0,,,['Paul Collins']

Beginning JavaScript,,"['Programming', 'Reference', 'Technology', 'Nonfiction', 'Technical']","JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to enhance static web applications by providing dynamic, personalized, and interactive content. This improves the experience of visitors to your site and makes it more likely that they will visit again. You must have seen the flashy drop-down menus, moving text, and changing content that are now widespread on web sites—they are enabled through JavaScript. Supported by all the major browsers, JavaScript is the language of choice on the Web. It can even be used outside web applications—to automate administrative tasks, for example.This book aims to teach you all you need to know to start experimenting with JavaScript: what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Starting from the basic syntax, you'll move on to learn how to create powerful web applications. Don't worry if you've never programmed before—this book will teach you all you need to know, step by step. You'll find that JavaScript can be a great introduction to the world of programming: with the knowledge and understanding that you'll gain from this book, you'll be able to move on to learn newer and more advanced technologies in the world of computing.In order to get the most out of this book, you'll need to have an understanding of HTML and how to create a static web page. You don't need to have any programming experience.This book will also suit you if you have some programming experience already, and would like to turn your hand to web programming. You will know a fair amount about computing concepts, but maybe not as much about web technologies.Alternatively, you may have a design background and know relatively little about the Web and computing concepts. For you, JavaScript will be a cheap and relatively easy introduction to the world of programming and web application development.Whoever you are, we hope that this book lives up to your expectations.You'll begin by looking at exactly what JavaScript is, and taking your first steps with the underlying language and syntax. You'll learn all the fundamental programming concepts, including data and data types, and structuring your code to make decisions in your programs or to loop over the same piece of code many times.Once you're comfortable with the basics, you'll move on to one of the key ideas in JavaScript—the object. You'll learn how to take advantage of the objects that are native to the JavaScript language, such as dates and strings, and find out how these objects enable you to manage complex data and simplify your programs. Next, you'll see how you can use JavaScript to manipulate objects made available to you in the browser, such as forms, windows, and other controls. Using this knowledge, you can start to create truly professional-looking applications that enable you to interact with the user.Long pieces of code are very hard to get right every time—even for the experienced programmer—and JavaScript code is no exception. You look at common syntax and logical errors, how you can spot them, and how to use the Microsoft Script Debugger to aid you with this task. Also, you need to examine how to handle the errors that slip through the net, and ensure that these do not detract from the experience of the end user of your application.From here, you'll move on to more advanced topics, such as using cookies and jazzing up your web pages with dynamic HTML and XML. Finally, you'll be looking at a relatively new and exciting technology, remote scripting. This allows your JavaScript in a HTML page to communicate directly with a server, and useful for, say, looking up information on a database sitting on your server. If you have the Google toolbar you'll have seen something like this in action already. When you type a search word in the Google toolbar, it comes up with suggestions, which it gets via the Google search database.All the new concepts introduced in this book will be illustrated with practical examples, which enable you to experiment with JavaScript and build on the theory that you have just learned. The appendix provides solutions to the exercises included at the end of most chapters throughout the book.During the first half of the book, you'll also be building up a more complex sample application—an online trivia quiz—which will show you how JavaScript is used in action in a real-world situation.",,Second Edition,12/01/00,May 7th 2004,[],Paperback,,9780764555879,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1178912846l/852922._SX318_.jpg,3.48,[],99.0,1.0,,,,88.0,83.0,1010,Wrox Press,"['11', '29', '33', '9', '1']",,[],,['Paul Wilton']

Bat Blood: The Devil's Claw,,"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction']","After a research facility is destroyed, the surrounding forest becomes a horrific war zone between intelligent winged mutants and mercenaries hired by the man that created them. When a mutant infects a local, Sarah's cancer is cured and both sides discover that she holds the key to their future.Richard Myerscough's Bat Blood contains common themes found in techno-thrillers like Michael Critchton's Prey, medical thriller's such as Robin Cook's Coma, and horror/sci/fi in the same vein as John Saul's The God Project. Bat Blood is a fun novel that contains cinematic battle scenes that might have come out of a Michael Bay action movie. What makes the novel even more frightening, beyond just the fear of the unknown, is that it feels as though the content could be ripped out of the latest newspaper headlines. Clarion ReviewSarah's cure was her curse, and her destiny After Sarah Douglas is attacked and infected with the blood of a gargoyle-like creature, the cancer that riddled her body vanishes. The attack draws the attention of Doctor Scott, the scientist who inadvertently was responsible for infecting a colony of bats, and changing them into intelligent creatures that could threaten mankind. As the infected blood slowly transforms Sarah's body, she is caught in the middle of an horrific war between an army of mercenaries and a colony of mutate winged creatures. Watching the creatures gorge themselves on human flesh, she sees her future and fights to maintain her humanity. With Sarah's blood holding the key to his research the doctor uses his vast resources to try to capture her, along with keeping the outside world at bay. This gets harder to do as the colony expands its territory further away from the Devil's Claw, and members of the local population begin to disappear.",,,02/07/13,March 2014,[],Paperback,,9781460206638,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399512923l/22051319.jpg,3.8,[],300.0,3.0,,,,80.0,41.0,432,FriesenPress,"['18', '8', '7', '5', '3']",,[],,['Richard Myerscough']

Here is a town, as well as a world, defined by magnificent and nearly devastating contradictions.Louis Charles (“Lucy”) Lynch has spent all his sixty years in upstate Thomaston, New York, married to the same woman, Sarah, for forty of them, their son now a grown man. Like his late, beloved father, Lucy is an optimist, though he’s had plenty of reasons not to be—chief among them his mother, still indomitably alive. Yet it was her shrewdness, combined with that Lynch optimism, that had propelled them years ago to the right side of the tracks and created an “empire” of convenience stores about to be passed on to the next generation. Lucy and Sarah are also preparing for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Italy, where his oldest friend, a renowned painter, has exiled himself far from anything they’d known in childhood. In fact, the exact nature of their friendship is one of the many mysteries Lucy hopes to untangle in the “history” he’s writing of his hometown and family. And with his story interspersed with that of Noonan, the native son who’d fled so long ago, the destinies building up around both of them (and Sarah, too) are relentless, constantly surprising, and utterly revealing. Bridge of Sighs is classic Russo, coursing with small-town rhythms and the claims of family, yet it is brilliantly enlarged by an expatriate whose motivations and experiences—often contrary, sometimes not—prove every bit as mesmerizing as they resonate through these richly different lives.

Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness Are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Psychology', 'Biology', 'Spirituality', 'Metaphysics', 'Popular Science', 'Nature']","Robert Lanza is one of the most respected scientists in the world—a US News & World Report cover story called him a ""genius"" and a ""renegade thinker,"" even likening him to Einstein. Lanza has teamed with Bob Berman, the most widely read astronomer in the world, to produce Biocentrism, a revolutionary new view of the universe.Every now and then a simple yet radical idea shakes the very foundations of knowledge. The startling discovery that the world was not flat challenged and ultimately changed the way people perceived themselves and their relationship with the world. For most humans of the 15th century, the notion of Earth as ball of rock was nonsense. The whole of Western, natural philosophy is undergoing a sea change again, increasingly being forced upon us by the experimental findings of quantum theory, and at the same time, towards doubt and uncertainty in the physical explanations of the universe’s genesis and structure. Biocentrism completes this shift in worldview, turning the planet upside down again with the revolutionary view that life creates the universe instead of the other way around.In this paradigm, life is not an accidental byproduct of the laws of physics. Biocentrism takes the reader on a seemingly improbable but ultimately inescapable journey through a foreign universe—our own—from the viewpoints of an acclaimed biologist and a leading astronomer. Switching perspective from physics to biology unlocks the cages in which Western science has unwittingly managed to confine itself. Biocentrism will shatter the reader’s ideas of life—time and space, and even death. At the same time it will release us from the dull worldview of life being merely the activity of an admixture of carbon and a few other elements; it suggests the exhilarating possibility that life is fundamentally immortal.The 21st century is predicted to be the Century of Biology, a shift from the previous century dominated by physics. It seems fitting, then, to begin the century by turning the universe outside-in and unifying the foundations of science with a simple idea discovered by one of the leading life-scientists of our age. Biocentrism awakens in readers a new sense of possibility, and is full of so many shocking new perspectives that the reader will never see reality the same way again.",,,,April 14th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9781933771694,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347600647l/5625477.jpg,3.92,[],87.0,1.0,,,,91.0,3397.0,223,BenBella Books,"['1174', '1189', '715', '210', '109']",,[],,"['Robert Lanza', 'Bob Berman']"

Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Biology', 'Neuroscience', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Anthropology']","Why do we do the things we do? More than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy. And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.",,,,May 2nd 2017,[],Hardcover,,9781594205071,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517732866l/31170723._SY475_.jpg,4.42,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science & Technology (2017)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Longlist (2018)', 'PEN/E.O.

These are the things I want to tell you.... Robert McCammon delivers ""a tour de force of storytelling"" (BookPage) in his award-winning masterpiece, a novel of Southern boyhood, growing up in the 1960s, that reaches far beyond that evocative landscape to touch readers universally. Boy's Life is a richly imagined, spellbinding portrait of the magical worldview of the young -- and of innocence lost. Zephyr, Alabama, is an idyllic hometown for eleven-year-old Cory Mackenson -- a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever. Then, one cold spring morning, Cory and his father witness a car plunge into a lake -- and a desperate rescue attempt brings his father face-to-face with a terrible, haunting vision of death. As Cory struggles to understand his father's pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that surround him. From an ancient mystic who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown -- for his father's sanity and his own life hang in the balance....",,,08/01/91,May 1st 1992,[],Mass Market Paperback,,9780671743055,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314302694l/11553.jpg,4.36,"['Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel (1991)', 'World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (1992)', 'Japan Adventure Fiction Association Prize 日本冒険小説協会大賞特別賞 for Best Translated Novel (1995)']",3969.0,49.0,,,,97.0,26225.0,580,Pocket Books,"['14387', '7979', '2968', '650', '241']",,"['Zephyr, Alabama (United States)', 'Alabama (United States)']",,['Robert R.

Not a master mason or carpenter, Filippo Brunelleschi was a goldsmith and clock maker. Over twenty-eight years, he would dedicate himself to solving puzzles of the dome's construction. In the process, he did nothing less than reinvent the field of architecture. He engineered the perfect placement of brick and stone (some among the most renowned machines of the Renaissance) to carry an estimated seventy million pounds hundreds of feet into the air, and designed the workers' platforms and routines so carefully that only one man died during the decades of construction.

She is a curandera, one who heals with herbs and magic. 'We cannot let her live her last days in loneliness,' says Antonio's mother. 'It is not the way of our people,' agrees his father. And so Ultima comes to live with Antonio's family in New Mexico. Soon Tony will journey to the threshold of manhood. Always, Ultima watches over him. She graces him with the courage to face childhood bigotry, diabolical possession, the moral collapse of his brother, and too many violent deaths. Under her wise guidance, Tony will probe the family ties that bind him, and he will find in himself the magical secrets of the pagan past—a mythic legacy equally as palpable as the Catholicism of Latin America in which he has been schooled.

But when he single-handedly stopped that tornado on a stormy Christmas day in Oklahoma, he realized just how different he actually was.That tornado was the first of many strange events that seem to follow Weylyn from town to town, although he doesn’t like to take credit. As amazing as these powers may appear, they tend to manifest themselves at inopportune times and places. From freak storms to trees that appear to grow over night, Weylyn’s unique abilities are a curiosity at best and at worst, a danger to himself and the woman he loves. But Mary doesn’t care. Since Weylyn saved her from an angry wolf on her eleventh birthday, she’s known that a relationship with him isn’t without its risks, but as anyone who’s met Weylyn will tell you, once he wanders into your life, you’ll wish he’d never leave.Beasts of Extraordinary Circumstance tells the story of Weylyn Grey’s life from the perspectives of the people who knew him, loved him, and even a few who thought he was just plain weird. Although he doesn’t stay in any of their lives for long, he leaves each of them with a story to tell. Stories about a boy who lives with wolves, great storms that evaporate into thin air, fireflies that make phosphorescent honey, and a house filled with spider webs and the strange man who inhabits it.There is one story, however, that Weylyn wishes he could change: his own.

Raised by her aunt Mara, a callous woman who never showed any affection towards her niece. As soon she turns, Lola moves to Malta where she meets her future husband, Fergus. The two of them will ultimately build their dream life in Ireland. Lola’s past seems forever forgotten, until the day her aunt Mara dies under suspicious circumstances and her cousin Giulia vehemently discourages her from being involved. Uncertain about what to do, in the end, Lola flies over to Ponte Alto with her husband.The old town had not changed much, and neither had the twisted dynamics inside the Kopfler family.

We are connected through an intertwining sameness called the struggles and joys of finding and becoming our authentic selves. When I read her words, I felt acknowledged for my journey and for being a woman in these complex times... Thank you, Sabrina, for sharing your gift with us. May we all continue to share our journeys together so we know we are not alone.""--from the Foreword by Hilary Swank, actorFrom the acclaimed twenty-five-year-old author/artist of the stunning visual memoir Spilling Open comes the all-new multimedia installment of her intimate journey Brave on the Rocks: If You Don't Go, You Don't See.Picking up where Spilling Open left off, Sabrina Ward Harrison tells us about the surprising reaction to her first book. Via her readers' letters and e-mails, she realized that through her journal she had become an identifying voice for women around the world. However, along with recognition came a certain pressure to uphold her new image. Overwhelmed by her attempt to live up to what she thought she had to become, Sabrina decided to head out on her own. She chose as her destination Italy, a place she had always dreamed and written about, a place she felt she could go to ""recolor"" herself. In her journey she discovered a universal identity with other travelers and a particular kinship with the women she met.

It makes you stop and second guess who you are, what you’re doing in life, with life, and for the ones you love. This is that book. Through colorfully painted characters, “Broken People” forces the reader to reflect on self. There will be a broken part of you in one (or all) of these characters, guaranteed. The Fat Kid is a self-proclaimed therapist who devotes his life to help people that have difficulties helping themselves, people he considers to be ‘broken’. When he encounters a bulimic teenage girl through his internet blog who threatens to commit suicide, he begins to reflect on parts of his life that he has spent years repressing. He continues to assist her, and many other ‘Broken People’ through his blog. When he meets an extremely independent teenage girl who challenges him, his way of living, and his way of viewing life, he reluctantly listens. In doing so he challenges his past mistakes, his future, and ultimately he finds himself.Intentionally becoming obese in an effort to shield himself from the approach of outsiders wanting to better understand him, The Fat Kid hides behind his thick outer self. With an overbearing obnoxious attitude, he allows few people to enter his otherwise private life. Most of the people that he encounters come from his internet blog, and pose no real threat to him or to his odd lifestyle. Through his reflections on past experiences and his online assistance to others, we are exposed to alcoholism, addiction, drugs, racism, relationships, homosexuality, love, romance, teen relationships, parenting, teen sex, codependency, divorce, obesity, overworked parents, teen pregnancy, bulimia, bathroom selfies, tattoos, parenting, education, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and photo sharing are all discussed at length. The result is a book that will have you laughing, crying, contemplating your own life, and the lives of your parents and/or children. A must read for parents and children alike, regardless of age.

  Death Stalks Them All...
Kere is the second most infamous member of the shadow organization known as Sentella. An explosive engineer who strikes terror into the hearts of the League, the bounty on his head is truly staggering. No one knows his true identity.The daughter of a traitor, Zarya Starska grew up hard on the back streets of hell- her family hunted to the brink of extinction. But Zarya dreams of a different life and a different world. A world where the harsh hand of the Caronese emperor doesn’t destroy his subjects. As a Resistance leader, her goal is to topple the government that needlessly ruined the lives of her family and comrades-in-arms. In this deadly quest, the only person she can trust is a mysterious man known only as Kere.
  By The Light Of Day...
Kere has a dark secret and a brutal past. As he aids the Resistance, he’s actually working to bring down his own family- the Cruels- so named for the viciousness in their blood that runs so deep, no other name would do. Born and bred from one of the oldest and noblest families in the United Systems, Kere’s real name is Darling Cruel. And the one thing he wants most is to see his uncle, who stole the crown by murdering his father, pay for his crimes.
  If You Tell A Lie Long Enough, It Becomes The Truth...
In order to protect his mother from execution, Darling’s entire life has been built on a lie that he dare not breathe a contrary word about. His hands tied by his uncle’s cruelty. No one has ever seen the real him. No one except Zarya. She’s the only person he’s ever fully trusted with the truth. But when she betrays him by allowing a weapon he designed solely for her to be used against him, all bets are off.
  The Hero Is Now The Monster...
Betrayed to the deepest level, Darling becomes an enemy even worse than his uncle. His goal is not only to reign, but to kill every Resistance member he can find. He won’t rest until all of them are dead and that includes Zarya.
  The Twisted Hand Of Fate...
Zarya is the only hope to reach the heart of the man her people once considered their ally. A man who hates her with a fury so great that she knows it’s just a matter of time before he kills her. But if she can find the part of him that once trusted her, the part of him that once loved her, she might be able to save not only her own life, but those of her people.It’s an impossible mission.Too bad she doesn’t play the odds.",The League: Nemesis Rising #5,,,May 1st 2012,"['Darling', 'Zarya']",Hardcover,,9780446573313,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442842682l/12886599._SX318_.jpg,4.48,[],479.0,4.0,,,,97.0,11006.0,614,Grand Central Publishing,"['6907', '2895', '919', '197', '88']",,[],,['Sherrilyn Kenyon']

Brand New Justice,How Branding Places and Products Can Help the Developing World,Business & Economics,"Recently vilified as the prime dynamic driving home the breach between poor and rich nations, here the branding process is rehabilitated as a potential saviour of the economically underprivileged. Brand New Justice, now in a revised paperback edition, systematically analyses the success stories of the Top Thirteen nations, demonstrating that their wealth is based on the 'last mile' of the commercial process: buying raw materials and manufacturing cheaply in third world countries, these countries realise their lucrative profits by adding value through finishing, packaging and marketing and then selling the branded product on to the end-user at a hugely inflated price. The use of sophisticated global media techniques alongside a range of creative marketing activities are the lynchpins of this process. Applying his observations on economic history and the development and impact of global marketing, Anholt presents a cogent plan for developing nations to benefit from globalization. So long the helpless victim of capitalist trading systems, he shows that they can cross the divide and graduate from supplier nation to producer nation. Branding native produce on a global scale, making a commercial virtue out of perceived authenticity and otherness and fully capitalising on the 'last mile' benefits are key to this graduation and fundamental to forging a new global economic balance. Anholt argues with a forceful logic, but also backs his hypothesis with enticing glimpses of this process actually beginning to take place. Examining activities in India, Thailand, Russia and Africa among others, he shows the risks, challenges and pressures inherent in 'turning the tide', but above all he demonstrates the very real possibility of enlightened capitalism working as a force for good in global terms. * Controversial and thought-provoking analysis of issues that are central to 21st century economic thought; radical new thinking on wealth-creation in the developing world. * Unites world-class branding and marketing knowledge with an emerging-market development agenda. * Concrete answers to the problems of anti-capitalism, medium level poverty and the brand backlash; a way for the marketing and advertising industries to regain respect and a more positive reputation",,,,2005.0,,,0750666005,9780750666008,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MmahV_o4oh4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.69,,,,,,,,,184.0,,,15.0,,,['Simon Anholt']

In her village, as in so many others, sex before marriage was considered a grave dishonour to one's family and was punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of arranging her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family's clothes, he crept up on her, poured petrol over her and set her alight.In the eyes of their community he was a hero. An execution for a 'crime of honour' was a respectable duty unlikely to bring about condemnation from others. It certainly would not have provoked calls for his prosecution. More than five thousand cases of such honour killings are reported around the world each year and many more take place that we hear nothing about.Miraculously, Souad survived rescued by the women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horrifically burned, and abandoned by her family and community, it was only the intervention of a European aid worker that enabled Souad to receive the care and sanctuary she so desperately needed and to start her life again. She has now decided to tell her story and uncover the barbarity of honour killings, a practice which continues to this day.Burned Alive is a shocking testimony, a true story of almost unbelievable cruelty.

He is considered one of the precursors who introduced modernist poetry to Bengali Literature, at a period when it was influenced by Rabindranath Tagore's Romantic poetry. During the later half of the twentieth century, Jibanananda Das emerged as the most popular poet of modern Bengali literature. Popularity apart, Jibanananda Das had distinguished himself as an extraordinary poet presenting a paradigm hitherto unknown. It is a fact that his unfamiliar poetic diction, choice of words and thematic preferences took time to reach the heart of the readers. Towards the later half of the twentieth century the poetry of Jibanananda has become the defining essence of modernism in twentieth century Bengali poetry.

Seriously?I’m determined to get to the bottom of who’s pretending to be the spirit of Alona Dare (while I’m pretending to be someone else) and then get the heck out of this body. Or die trying...The GothI’ll admit it. It’s really weird to look at Alona but see Lily. I do know the difference, though, contrary to what Alona might be saying.

One of the “fakes” seems a bit more real-—and odd-—than the others. Before I can investigate further, though, Alona is off and chasing a ghost that’s probably nothing more than a figment of Misty’s guilty imagination.

Beneath the Bamboo: A Vietnam War Story,,['War'],"Excerpt: “I watched two point men take a 50-caliber machine gun bullet to the head, and watched the third being grabbed and taken behind enemy lines. Two of the enemy soldiers, which we often referred to as gooks, quickly came after me. As I quickly mowed them down with my automatic rifle, I crawled backwards away from the enemy gunfire, using my helmet to push sand in front of me as I went, which made it possible to look behind me. But as I looked back, I realized that my safety net was no longer safe. I saw my entire company falling like dominoes. Medics were running left and right, risking their lives to help others with bravery that even the most amazing soldier couldn’t hope to match. Some of the events I witnessed during that moment were beyond comprehension. I watched a young, courageous black medic take an 81-millimeter round to his head, and his whole body instantly turned to smoke. Young nineteen and twenty year old kids were crying like children, but fighting like someone had raped their sisters. So many things were going through my head at that moment, and in one single heartbeat I was overwhelmed with a flashback of my entire life.

Ball of Fire: The Tumultuous Life and Comic Art of Lucille Ball,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Film', 'Humor', 'Pop Culture', 'True Story', 'Womens', 'Comedy']","For more than fifty years Lucille Ball has been television's most recognizable and beloved face. As Lucy Ricardo she was the ultimate screwball housewife, getting herself into and out of scrapes with unmatched comic finesse. Indeed, she was so funny, and so central to the cultural landscape, that we often overlook Ball's role in shaping that turf: as producer of her own show and a cofounder of a major studio, she was a pioneer, rewriting the rules and forging new paths for women in the boardroom and on the sound stage. In Ball of Fire, Stefan Kanfer goes beyond the icon to examine the difficult life and enduring work of the most influential woman in modern American comedy. Kanfer traces the arc of her career from its unlikely beginnings in a lonely and desolate childhood in upstate New York. There she discovered that making people laugh could ease the pains of a fragmented family life. But she was more than amusing. She was also beautiful, and when Lucy's adolescent attempts to crack Broadway ended in failure, she became a runway model and on a fluke, journeyed out to California to be an extra in one film. That led to another, and another, and another bottom-of-the-bill movie, until she became, in her own words, ""The Queen of the B's."" Ball of Fire tracks Lucy's pursuit of the superstardom that eluded her on the big screen and follows the actress through a series of disappointing affairs and sorrows until she meets a Cuban conga drummer six years her junior, and falls headlong in love with Desi Arnaz. Working with her husband, Lucille Ball becomes a different kind of comic artist in a program called ""I Love Lucy,"" the show that is still running in more than eighty countries aroundthe globe. Taking us through the development of television both as technology and cultural phenomenon, Kanfer chronicles the difficult birth of the sitcom that changed the world. He details the early executive meetings, the rocky first productions, the shaky first weeks and the unpredicted triumph. We see all of Lucy's behind-the-scenes battles for creative control of the show; her surprising confrontation with the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was discovered that she had once registered to vote as a Communist; her groundbreaking on-air pregnancy; and a series of in-depth analyses of the classic scenes and Chaplinesque slapstick that guarantee her a permanent place in the pantheon of American comedy. Finally, we see the aftermath of her hard-won fame: the turbulent marriage and painful split from Desi, the man she never stopped loving; her second marriage; and her sad last years out of the limelight and away from the applause. This is the first biography to examine the legendary Lucille Ball in all her many dimensions: her personal struggles and the torments that forged a comic genius; and, at last, her posthumous influence on television comedy, on feminist scholars and cultural critics, and on the public at large. Ball of Fire is the definitive biography Lucy fans have been waiting for.",,,01/01/03,August 19th 2003,['Lucille Ball'],Hardcover,,9780375413155,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1179999034l/983567.jpg,3.85,[],98.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1107.0,384,Knopf,"['315', '413', '302', '57', '20']",,[],,['Stefan Kanfer']

The author suggests that, like the black holes of outer space, from which nothing, not even light, can escape, our contemporary cultural landscape contains numerous intellectual black-holes—belief systems constructed in such a way that unwary passers-by can similarly find themselves drawn in. While such self-sealing bubbles of belief will most easily trap the gullible or poorly educated, even the most intelligent and educated of us are potentially vulnerable. Some of the world’s greatest thinkers have fallen in, never to escape.

Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Comedian', 'Film']","In the midseventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of ""why I did stand-up and why I walked away."" Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before.

As his condition worsened and his postseizure responses became more intense, he was often prone to violent outbursts that threatened his safety as well as the safety of those in his inner circle. McCallum shares how the perception of the disease and the socially unacceptable behaviors that occurred as a result of his seizures eventually forced him to risk everything-he made the life-altering decision to undergo two brain operations that he hoped would provide freedom from a life of instability, danger, and stares from strangers.""Beyond My Control"" provides an honest, emotional look into a highly complex and often misunderstood condition and how one man's perseverance helped him break through the darkness to find hope on the other side.",,,,May 4th 2008,[],Paperback,,9780595487059,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348628160l/3398701.jpg,4.34,[],96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,89.0,108,iUniverse,"['58', '12', '12', '5', '2']",,[],,['Stuart Ross McCallum']

Back to Planet Hoola,,[],"“Back to Planet Hoola”, written by Author Sudipta Das, is a Sci Fi (Science Fiction) book with philosophical and spiritual tinges, and the author’s wonderful realisations embedded in an alien plot of divine aspirations, evil desires, intrigue, wisdom and love. In this sequel to the Author’s internationally published and globally presented debut fiction, The Asylum Dweller’s Diary, there are imaginative, interesting and insightful stories within the storyline, serving you with food for thought.Things that are too far away for the eyes to see, have to be brought closer with a telescope. Conversely, things that are too near and attached and, therefore, defy perception, may become perceptible with detachment from a distance, putting aside the stereotypes thrust by the external world upon the internal psyche. Kit, the protagonist, takes his friend Doctor Adam Smith, the narrator, to this alien planet Hoola, millions of light years away from Earth. Hoola is a unique multi-coloured planet, and so is the alien Hoo race that lives on it. Kit vows to harmonise the Hoo race fragmented by their colour differences. The odds are heavily against him. A Sword of honour has to be recovered from the enemy. Ages old anomalies have to be set right. Kit’s unifying efforts inevitably produce ugly reactions from the divisive forces. He is abducted by a ruthless cunning despot. Death is the order for Kit.

Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Gender', 'Womens', 'Gender Studies', 'Womens Studies', 'Psychology']","Skillfully Probing the Attack on Women’s Rights“Opting-out,” “security moms,” “desperate housewives,” “the new baby fever”—the trend stories of 2006 leave no doubt that American women are still being barraged by the same backlash messages that Susan Faludi brilliantly exposed in her 1991 bestselling book of revelations. Now, the book that reignited the feminist movement is back in a fifteenth anniversary edition, with a new preface by the author that brings backlash consciousness up to date. When it was first published, Backlash made headlines for puncturing such favorite media myths as the “infertility epidemic” and the “man shortage,” myths that defied statistical realities. These willfully fictitious media campaigns added up to an antifeminist backlash. Whatever progress feminism has recently made, Faludi’s words today seem prophetic. The media still love stories about stay-at-home moms and the “dangers” of women’s career ambitions; the glass ceiling is still low; women are still punished for wanting to succeed; basic reproductive rights are still hanging by a thread. The backlash clearly exists.With passion and precision, Faludi shows in her new preface how the creators of commercial culture distort feminist concepts to sell products while selling women downstream, how the feminist ethic of economic independence is twisted into the consumer ethic of buying power, and how the feminist quest for self-determination is warped into a self-centered quest for self-improvement. Backlash is a classic of feminism, an alarm bell for women of every generation, reminding us of the dangers that we still face.",,,10/01/91,August 15th 2006,[],Paperback,,9780307345424,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386922920l/200883.jpg,4.01,"['California Book Award for Nonfiction (Silver) (1991)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction (1991)']",361.0,4.0,,,,94.0,8518.0,594,Broadway Books,"['2972', '3298', '1726', '369', '153']",,[],,['Susan Faludi']

He was king of the lion shifters once, but his fall from power came at a huge personal cost. Rumors run rampant over what really happened to his pride, but the truth has hardened Beast’s heart to stone. He’s kept the Blackwings at arm’s length, but when a human starts stalking his crew, his inner monster-kitty gets curious. Kiera is gorgeous and mysterious, but she also has strange eyes and a scent that is calling to his animal. No human has ever interested him quite like her. But when he finds out who, and what, she really is, he’ll have to risk his heart again. And for a monster like him, caring for a woman could put everyone around him in danger.  Kiera Pierce has been through hell and back, but she’s still standing and fighting. She’s in big trouble, and is being hunted by one brutal pride of lion shifters. When she seeks sanctuary in Kane’s Mountains, she doesn’t expect a scar-faced behemoth to be her hero. Oh, she’s heard of Beast, and knows the rumors about him, and if they’re true, he’s a ruthless killer in a sexy package. Perhaps that’s the kind of protection she needs. But the more she gets to know the quiet and dangerous Beast, the more she thinks he might be able to save more than her life. He just might be able to save her heart as well.

Between the World and Me,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Biography', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Politics', 'African American']","“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder.

Pull the trigger. Hide. Run. Stay away from the other survivors. Stay away from the Infected. She has obeyed her father's rules since she can remember running from the car accident that claimed his life. But one night that all changes. The knock at her cabin door and voice of the girl on the other side don't make Emma help the girl. No-it's the fact that the girl, Anna, is willing to die to save her wounded brother that changes everything in Emma's world. Emma finds friends and family in Anna and her brother Jake. She feels things that she thought she never would. But like her Granny always said, ""Everything comes at a cost. You must decide what you are willing to pay."" For Emma, that decision comes as Anna is stolen and taken to the breeder farms. Emma knows that she will pay anything to get Anna back, including her own life.",Born #1,,09/02/12,July 29th 2015,[],Audio CD,,9781494510091,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442834854l/26458135.jpg,4.05,[],94.0,1.0,,,,92.0,8047.0,,Tantor Audio,"['3223', '2791', '1403', '442', '188']",,[],,"['Tara Brown', 'A.

Now Terry L. Givens offers a full-length treatment of this influential work, illuminating the varied meanings and tempestuous impact of this uniquely American scripture. Givens examines the text's role as a divine testament of the Last Days and as a sacred sign of Joseph Smith's status as a modern-day prophet. He assesses its claim to be a history of the pre-Columbian peopling of the Western Hemisphere, and later explores how the Book has been defined as a cultural product--the imaginative ravings of a rustic religion-maker. Givens further investigates its status as a new American Bible or Fifth Gospel, one that displaces, supports, or, in some views, perverts the canonical Word of God. Finally, Givens highlights the Book's role as the engine behind what may become the next world religion. The most wide-ranging study on the subject outside Mormon presses, By the Hand of Mormon will fascinate anyone curious about a religious people who, despite their numbers, remain strangers in our midst.",,,03/14/02,August 21st 2003,[],Paperback,,9780195168884,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348938876l/515431.jpg,4.22,[],89.0,1.0,,,,96.0,701.0,336,"Oxford University Press, USA","['303', '284', '87', '19', '8']",,[],,['Terryl L.

As a pathologist in a major metropolitan city, she has seen more than her share of corpses every day–many of them victims of violent murder. But never before has her blood run cold, and never has the grim expression “dead ringer” rung so terrifyingly true. Because never before has the lifeless body on the medical examiner’s table been her own.Yet there can be no denying the mind-reeling evidence before her shocked eyes and those of her colleagues, including Detective Jane Rizzoli: the woman found shot to death outside Maura’s home is the mirror image of Maura, down to the most intimate physical nuances. Even more chilling is the discovery that they share the same birth date and blood type. For the stunned Maura, an only child, there can be just one explanation. And when a DNA test confirms that Maura’s mysterious doppelgänger is in fact her twin sister, an already bizarre murder investigation becomes a disturbing and dangerous excursion into a past full of dark secrets.Searching for answers, Maura is drawn to a seaside town in Maine where other horrifying surprises await.

Bulfinch's Mythology,,"['Mythology', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Reference', 'Fantasy', 'Religion', 'Literature', 'Folklore', 'Classic Literature', 'Historical Fiction']","For almost a century and a half, Bulfinch's Mythology has been the text by which the great tales of the gods and goddesses, Greek and Roman antiquity; Scandinavian, Celtic, and Oriental fables and myths; and the age of chivalry have been known.         The stories are divided into three sections: The Age of Fable or Stories of Gods and Heroes (first published in 1855); The Age of Chivalry (1858), which contains King Arthur and His Knights, The Mabinogeon, and The Knights of English History; and Legends of Charlemagne or Romance of the Middle Ages (1863). For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, and for the sagas of the north, from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. He provides lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas; the joys of Valhalla and the furies of Thor; and the tales of Beowulf and Robin Hood. The tales are eminently readable. As Bulfinch wrote, ""Without a knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated. . . . Our book is an attempt to solve this problem, by telling the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement.""Thomas Bulfinch, in his day job, was a clerk in the Merchant's Bank of Boston, an undemanding position that afforded him ample leisure time in which to pursue his other interests. In addition to serving as secretary of the Boston Society of Natural History, he thoroughly researched the myths and legends and copiously cross-referenced them with literature and art. As such, the myths are an indispensable guide to the cultural values of the nineteenth century; however, it is the vigor of the stories themselves that returns generation after generation to

Being Mentally Ill: A Sociological Theory,,"['Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Health']","In incorporating social process into a model of the dynamics of mental disorders, this text questions the individualistic model favoured in current psychiatric and psychoanalytic theory. While the conventional psychiatric viewpoint seeks the causes of mental illness, Scheff views ""the symptoms of mental illness"" as the violation of residual rules - social norms so taken for granted that they are not explicitly verbalized. The sociological theory developed by Scheff to account for such behaviour provides a framework for studies reported in subsequent chapters. Two key assumptions emerge: first, that most chronic mental illness is in part a social role; and second, that societal reaction may in part determine entry into that role. Throughout, the sociological model of mental illness is compared and contrasted with more conventional medical and psychological models in an attempt to delineate significant problems for further analysis and research. This third edition has been revised and expanded to encompass the controversy prompted by the first edition, and also to re-evaluate developments in the field. New to this edition are discussions of the use of psychoactive drugs in the treatment of mental illness, changing mental health laws, new social science and psychiatric studies, and the controversy surrounding the labelling theory of mental illness itself.",,,11/06/66,December 31st 1999,[],Paperback,,9780202305875,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348418918l/1706113.jpg,4.08,[],81.0,1.0,,,,96.0,25.0,234,Routledge,"['9', '11', '4', '0', '1']",,[],,['Thomas J.

As Mann charts the Buddenbrooks’ decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, he ushers the reader into a world of stunning vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor.In its immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, buddenbrooks surpasses all other modern family chronicles.

As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity.

The world they inhabit is one of poverty and violence--both from outside the family, and also, devastatingly, from within. The lush landscape, rich with birdsong, wild fruit, and blazing stars, becomes a kind of refuge for Betty, but when her family's darkest secrets are brought to light, she has no choice but to reckon with the brutal history hiding in the hills, as well as the heart-wrenching cruelties and incredible characters she encounters in her rural town of Breathed, Ohio. But despite the hardship she faces, Betty is resilient. Her curiosity about the natural world, her fierce love for her sisters, and her father's brilliant stories are kindling for the fire of her own imagination, and in the face of all she bears witness to, Betty discovers an escape: she begins to write. She recounts the horrors of her family's past and present with pen and paper and buries them deep in the dirt--moments that has stung her so deeply, she could not tell them, until now.

On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio.

Venturing beyond all limits—in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior—there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome.

This book is for you. Timothy Morton, who has been called 'Our most popular guide to the new epoch' (Guardian), sets out to show us that whether we know it or not, we already have the capacity and the will to change the way we understand the place of humans in the world, and our very understanding of the term 'ecology'. A cross-disciplinarian who has collaborated with everyone from Björk to Hans Ulrich Obrist, Morton is also a member of the object-oriented philosophy movement, a group of forward-looking thinkers who are grappling with modern-day notions of subjectivity and objectivity, while also offering fascinating new understandings of Heidegger and Kant.

Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War II', 'Russia', 'European History', 'Holocaust', 'Politics', 'Germany', 'Historical']","Americans call the Second World War “The Good War.” But before it even began, America’s wartime ally Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens—and kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war’s end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.From BooklistIf there is an explanation for the political killing perpetrated in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, historian Snyder roots it in agriculture. Stalin wanted to collectivize farmers; Hitler wanted to eliminate them so Germans could colonize the land. The dictators wielded frightening power to advance such fantasies toward reality, and the despots toted up about 14 million corpses between them, so stupefying a figure that Snyder sets himself three goals here: to break down the number into the various actions of murder that comprise it, from liquidation of the kulaks to the final solution; to restore humanity to the victims via surviving testimony to their fates; and to deny Hitler and Stalin any historical justification for their policies, which at the time had legions of supporters and have some even today. Such scope may render Snyder’s project too imposing to casual readers, but it would engage those exposed to the period’s chronology and major interpretive issues, such as the extent to which the Nazi and Soviet systems may be compared.

To have no memory of ever being alone.”Twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike are enjoying a relatively comfortable life in Lagos in 1996. Then their mother loses her job due to political strife, and the family, facing poverty, becomes drawn into the New Church, an institution led by a charismatic pastor who is not shy about worshipping earthly wealth. Soon Bibike and Ariyike’s father wagers the family home on a “sure bet” that evaporates like smoke. As their parents’ marriage collapses in the aftermath of this gamble, the twin sisters and their two younger siblings, Andrew and Peter, are thrust into the reluctant care of their traditional Yoruba grandmother.

On that same night, London's titled, wealthy and beautiful waltz the night away at Glenister House. Among the guests aristocratic Charles Fraser, a former spy recently returned from the Napoleonic Wars, and his bride Mélanie, who has charmed London society but hides her own secrets. In the brilliance of Mayfair, a visitor from their past pulls Charles and Mélanie back into the world of danger and espionage they thought they had left behind. But this time, the intrigues are rooted in Charles's complex and troubled family. Melanie and Charles Fraser have traded the moment-to-moment dangers of the war-ravaged Continent for the glittering world of the British ton. But beneath the shimmering veneer of London society, they discover an establishment that is rotten to its very core. An assassination and a trail of clues that lead back to the French Revolution itself plunge Charles and Melanie once more into the danger that has always been the common ground in their marriage.

A secret society, and the dangerous liaisons of the Fraser family lead Charles and Mélanie from the glittering ballrooms and shadowy streets of London to the Fraser estate on the Scottish coast. This is a deadly game that could shake the fate of nations: but for Charles, the stakes are the lives of those he holds most dear, and the love of the enigmatic woman who shares his name...and his bed.

Before the Dawn,,"['Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction']","Although Before the Dawn is the story of the author's family and of the Meiji restoration, it is much more than that; the aftermath of the events that form its context have fundamentally altered the nature of the world we live in. Its author was a man of sophistication and erudition even though he was not given to virtuoso displays of either quality. He created this novel out of his personal and artistic needs, and out of his sense of the need of Japan and the world community to know the story he tells in it. Japan has been richly served by the original. But Toson had a worldwide as well as a Japanese audience in mind when he wrote Before the Dawn. This translation has been done in the hope of contributing to that undertaking.Before the Dawn looks back on the adventure, turmoil, and tragedy of the mid-nineteenth century with a clear and unsentimental vision, but it speaks of those times in tones of tact, humility, and deference. It is a celebration of the humanity of its characters and the richness, complexity, and diversity of the lives they lived during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and the first two decades of the Meiji era. For all the weight of its historical concerns, it maintains its lyrical tone even when the subject is external threat, internal political turmoil, the grinding hardship of maintaining the old post system, or the bitter disappointments that the new age brought so many of those who had worked hardest and sacrificed most to bring it into being. It has been followed not only by scholarly studies but also by an immense outpouring of historical fiction, family and local histories, and other publications drawing on the rich store of old diaries and official records preserved throughout the country. These later works often illuminate the period from points of view that were not accessible to any of Toson's characters, but Before the Dawn remains the standard against which all others are measured. --from the Introduction",,,April 1929,July 1st 1988,[],Paperback,,9780824811648,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347592600l/335940.jpg,4.07,[],18.0,1.0,,,,98.0,43.0,816,University of Hawaii Press,"['16', '15', '11', '1', '0']",,[],,"['Tōson Shimazaki', 'William E.

Movie theaters are said to be the ""temples of modern India,"" with Bombay producing nearly 800 films per year that are viewed by roughly 11 million people per day. In Bollywood Cinema, Vijay Mishra argues that Indian film production and reception is shaped by the desire for national community and a pan-Indian popular culture. Seeking to understand Bollywood according to its own narrative and aesthetic principles and in relation to a global film industry, he views Indian cinema through the dual methodologies of postcolonial studies and film theory. Mishra discusses classics such as Mother India (1957) and Devdas (1935) and recent films including Ram Lakhan (1989) and Khalnayak (1993), linking their form and content to broader issues of national identity, epic tradition, popular culture, history, and the implications of diaspora.",,,10/30/01,December 7th 2001,[],Paperback,,9780415930154,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347256632l/422463.jpg,3.76,[],98.0,1.0,,,,92.0,25.0,296,Routledge,"['6', '10', '7', '1', '1']",,[],,['Vijay Mishra']

Under the slogans of equality and happiness for all, it has done away with individualism and freedom of thought. Only John Krug, a brilliant philosopher, stands up to the regime. His antagonist, the leader of the new party, is his old school enemy, Paduk – known as the ‘Toad’. Grieving over his wife’s recent death, Krug is at first dismissive of Paduk’s activities and sees no threat in them.

By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",,,07/01/03,June 2004,['Benjamin Franklin'],Paperback,,9780743258074,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397772877l/10883.jpg,4.0,[],163.0,2.0,,,,91.0,113854.0,586,Simon & Schuster,"['45776', '38423', '19079', '5526', '5050']",,['United States of America'],,['Walter Isaacson']

This scale is a measurement of your thoughts. To restore the same balance that characterizes everything in our universe, you have to take up the weighty thoughts so that they match up to your desires.The seasons reflect the overall harmony of life. For example, winter passes and the blossoms emerge. This is balanced by a need to have the trees rest, so autumn arrives on time and helps the trees ready themselves for another period of repose.

  Only a farmer could delve so deeply into the origins of food, and only a writer of Wendell Berry’s caliber could convey it with such conviction and eloquence. Long before Whole Foods organic produce was available at your local supermarket, Berry was farming with the purity of food in mind. For the last five decades, Berry has embodied mindful eating through his land practices and his writing. In recognition of that influence, Michael Pollan here offers an introduction to this wonderful collection.Drawn from over thirty years of work, this collection joins bestsellers The Omnivore’s Dilemma, by Pollan, and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, by Barbara Kingsolver, as essential reading for anyone who cares about what they eat. The essays address such concerns as: How does organic measure up against locally grown? What are the differences between small and large farms, and how does that affect what you put on your dinner table? What can you do to support sustainable agriculture?A progenitor of the Slow Food movement, Wendell Berry reminds us all to take the time to understand the basics of what we ingest. “Eating is an agriculture act,” he writes. Indeed, we are all players in the food economy.

Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption,,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Psychology', 'Mental Health', 'Biography', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Spirituality']","From rock bottom to recovery—the son of veteran broadcaster Bill Moyers chronicles his life- shattering battle with addiction and the hard-won fight for recovery  William Cope Moyers has come a long, long way. In 1994, he lay on the floor of an Atlanta crack house. His father had put together a search party. His worried family waited at home where Moyers had left them when he embarked on yet another binge. From that lowly, drug-hazed night, Moyers went on to become an executive at the Hazelden Foundation and travels far and wide to talk about addiction and treatment.  Broken tells the story of what happened between then and now—from growing up the privileged son of Bill Moyers to his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, his numerous stabs at getting clean, his many relapses, and how he managed to survive. Harrowing and wrenching, Broken paints a picture of a man with every advantage who nonetheless found himself spiraling into a dark and life-threatening abyss. But unlike other memoirs of its kind, Broken emerges into the clear light of Moyers’s recovery as he dedicates his life to changing the politics of addiction.

Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'History']","A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed New Yorker writerBarbarian Days is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. Barbarian Days takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.Barbarian Days is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar.",,,,July 21st 2015,[],Hardcover,,9781594203473,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418768620l/18693910.jpg,4.23,"['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (2016)', 'William Hill Sports Book of the Year (2016)']",90.0,1.0,,,,96.0,18797.0,447,Penguin Press,"['8656', '6724', '2659', '609', '149']",,[],,['William Finnegan']

Bakakaï,,"['Short Stories', 'Polish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Poland', 'Literature', 'Collections', 'Classics']","Bakakaï no es simplemente una palabra exótica evocadora de misteriosas aventuras, sino también el nombre de una calle de Buenos Aires y el título de este libro de Witold Gombrowicz que tiene una historia muy larga y entretenida.En 1933, en Cracovia. Gombrowicz publicó un libro que contenía sus primeros siete cuentos, escritos entre 1926 y 1932. Más tarde, en 1957, vuelve a recogerlos en otro libro, esta vez ya titulado Bakakaï, añadiéndoles tres cuentos más, escritos entre 1933 y 1946. Curiosamente, dispone los textos en orden cronológico inverso, de modo que el último en el índice es, de hecho, su primera obra escrita. Por su naturaleza profundamente impúdica, Bakakaï no vio la luz en la España franquista hasta que, en 1970, Tusquets Editores hizo el primer intento reduciéndolo a tres cuentos, publicados con el título de uno de ellos, La virginidad. Finalmente, en 1974, también en traducción del escritor mexicano Sergio Pitol, apareció Bakakaï en Barral Editores con sus diez cuentos completos. Nos alegra ahora poder rescatar otra vez esta obra de esa espléndida, pero a la vez desafortunada, lista de los libros «inencontrables».Poco antes de morir, Witold Gombrowicz definía así este libro suyo : «Cuando releo estos cuentos lejanos, advierto que hay riqueza en ellos y que vibran sorprendentes cortocircuitos.

It will bring joy to your soul as you turn the pages ever faster. In a grey, permanently overcast city in South America, a child is born with a gap in his chest; a heart that is open to the world.

Paco refuses, opting to follow his dream of singing. Driven from his home by his father's ultimatum, Paco is lured into a world of political deception where his musical abilities land him on the wrong side of the law... and deeply in love.

Yu Hua, award-winning author of To Live, gives us a surreal tale of two brothers riding the dizzying roller coaster of life in a newly capitalist world. As comically mismatched teenagers, Baldy Li, a sex-obsessed ne’er-do-well, and Song Gang, his bookish, sensitive stepbrother, vow that they will always be brothers--a bond they will struggle to maintain over the years as they weather the ups and downs of rivalry in love and making and losing millions in the new China. Their tribulations play out across a richly populated backdrop that is every bit as vibrant: the rapidly-changing village of Liu Town, full of such lively characters as the self-important Poet Zhao, the craven dentist Yanker Yu, the virginal town beauty (turned madam) Lin Hong, and the simpering vendor Popsicle Wang.With sly and biting humor, combined with an insightful and compassionate eye for the lives of ordinary people, Yu Hua shows how the madness of the Cultural Revolution has transformed into the equally rabid madness of extreme materialism.

Building Mount Everest,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction']","World War II has ended but British colonial traditions are silently at war with an Australia whose identity is maturing relentlessly. This network of tales is told by a near-sighted child, half-British, half-European, certain she can make peace in her family and within the culture. Neither her culture nor her family is ready for peace. This haunting novel spans wars, continents, and the Great Depression. It spins a strange future from old loves, loyalties, and secrets.

Reality is more dangerous than imagination; religion, than sex. Reserve shrouds fact and prejudice. A sweater, glasses, letter, shard: each changes the course of a life. A girls’ school breeds strictures, loves, betrayals. A religious meeting forces impossible choices. A mother’s secret, long held, ordains a daughter’s life. A grasshopper, moth, puppy: each can end a childhood and unfold truths and passions, rarely simple. Throughout, the great heart of Australia beats in each life and decision.

"Barracoon: The Story of the Last ""Black Cargo""",,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'Africa', 'African American', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Anti Racist']","In 1927, Zora Neale Hurston went to Plateau, Alabama, just outside Mobile, to interview eighty-six-year-old Cudjo Lewis. Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation's history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo's firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo's past--memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo's unique vernacular, and written from Hurston's perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it.

Bazı şiirler ise birkaç kez yazılmışlardı, bunları da özenli bir eleştirel seçme işleminden sonra kitaba koyduk.”Doğan Hızlan",,,11/06/83,2010,[],Paperback,,9789750818813,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438113704l/10116450._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],70.0,1.0,,,,93.0,324.0,280,Yapı Kredi Yayınları,"['141', '103', '57', '17', '6']",,[],,['Özdemir Asaf']

Beautiful Names of Allah,,"['Islam', 'Nonfiction']","The pristine beliefs of the early Muslims are preserved in this vitally important masterpiece written by one of the most outstanding scholars of our time, Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen. This new revised edition by Dar-us-Salam has been printed in full color with hardback bounding for an excellent presentation. Seven clear principles and their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah guide the reader through the confusion and false claims of the ignorant to the clarity of belief in Allah's Names accomplished by the righteous early scholars of Islam. Principle 6 contains the shaikh's compilation of the ninety-nine (99) names of Allah. The names have been compiled into 2 categories: first from the Book of Allah & second from the Sunnah of the Prophet (S). All the names have been printed in Arabic with transliteration and English translation. Each name is printed beautifully in a square box with 6 boxes on a page. Seven more principles and their evidences follow, giving the reader firm understanding of the correct beliefs about Allah's Attributes. Four more principles outline the correct approach in studying the related proofs and evidences. All of this leads the reader into an enthralling series of refutations of the false notions of the Ash'aree sect, a text-by-text breakdown of how and why they went wrong in a careful and precise study of fifteen texts from the Book and the Sunnah. The beliefs of the Ash'aree sect are destroyed and the origins of their deviation are exposed for all to see.
