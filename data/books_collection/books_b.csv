B. Andreas Bull-Hansen,Lushons plater,,Norwegian,,"En bredt anlagt og handlingsmettet fremtidsvisjon. Spennende og skremmende realistisk, en tankevekkende påminnelse om en nær og mulig fremtid. I år 2053 bryter tredje verdenskrig ut, med katastrofale følger for miljøet. De få overlevende søker ly i undergrunnen, i falleferdige parkeringshus og t-banestasjoner, der de samler seg i primitive stammesamfunn. Solen er nå blitt så sterk at den dreper. Treårsvintre og støvstormer har forvandlet mesteparten av Europa til en ødemark kalt Daulandet. Matmangelen er stor, og kannibalisme er en helt vanlig foreteelse.I ruinbyen Osh Lo møter vi nattjegeren Evv Lushon. Siden han er født med mutasjoner, betraktes han som en av gennerne, en underkaste som rangerer langt under menneskene i Bigge-Mahmeds klan. Evv har ulveaktige trekk, og som nattjeger er det hans oppgave å jakte på de rivaliserende klanenes jegere. Han er etterkommer av en transgener, en genetisk manipulert elitesoldat, og kan bare se i nattemørke. Likevel er det mer ved Evv enn klanens mennesker tror. Evvs fosterfar Olda har lært ham om Bokk-Staver og verden slik den var før krigen brøt ut, og når klanen blir utryddet og Mennihetas korsbærende krigere lover å drepe alle nattjegere, flykter Evv sørover gjennom Europa, på søken etter de siste restene av sivilisasjon.",Trilogien om Evv Lushon #1,,10/06/04,2005,[],Paperback,"['Dystopia', 'Science Fiction']",,9788202244835,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297522388l/10443409.jpg,4.18,[],48.0,1.0,,10443409-lushons-plater,,,,,93.0,76.0,599,,Cappelen Damm,"['35', '26', '10', '4', '1']",,,[],,

Why were her parents dead? Why did she not have family? Where was she raised until she was five? When someone offers to explain it all, Arianna thinks she’s just getting answers. Instead, she is thrown into a world of night humans who drink blood.On Arianna's sixteenth birthday, her world is thrown upside down when she changes into a vampire.

Divided into two sides, clans Baku and Tengu have been at war for centuries with the clans Dearg-dul and Lycan. That is, until Arianna Grace finds out the truth; she’s the bridge of peace between the two sides. But not everyone wants peace. With the night humans divided, Arianna is now a pawn in the war between them.

B. Traven,The Rebellion of the Hanged,,English,,"The Rebellion of the Hanged is the fifth of B. Traven's six legendary Jungle Novels which together form an epic of the birth of the Mexican Revolution. Set in the slave-labor mahogany plantations of tropical Mexico in 1910, at the time of the uprising against the rule of Porfirio D�az and the beginnings of revolution, Rebellion is a powerful and somber tale of the tortures suffered by downtrodden Indians. But here it culminates in a revolt by the long-oppressed workers against the owners and overseers of the camps, and in a treacherous march through the jungles at the height of the rainy season--a human feat of epic proportions. In addition to his great storytelling ability, Traven's work has a special resonance today because of recent uprisings in the Chiapas highlands of southern Mexico, the very locale for many of Traven's writings.

The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon!Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling, award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. SPEED is Harley's book--a gritty, '90s-era love triangle overflowing with dark humor, intense heat, and tangible teen angst. It is based on a true story.Ronald “Knight” McKnight was Obsessive.

When he left, Knight told me to “find someone better,” but I didn’t. I found Harley instead. Harley James was a fun, flirty, tattooed mechanic whose face was as angelic as his secrets were sinful. He taught me how to live again. How to laugh again. But would he teach me how to love again? Over Knight’s dead body.
  *SPEED is Book 2 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone.

A woman sets out to seduce motivational speaker Tony Robbins - turning for help to the famed motivator himself. A school principal unveils a bold plan to permanently abolish arithmetic. An acclaimed ambulance driver seeks the courage to follow his heart and throw it all away to be a singer-songwriter. Author John Grisham contemplates a monumental typo. A new arrival in heaven, overwhelmed by infinite options, procrastinates over his long-ago promise to visit his grandmother. We meet a vengeance-minded hare, obsessed with scoring a rematch against the tortoise who ruined his life; and post-college friends who debate how to stage an intervention in the era of Facebook. We learn why wearing a red t-shirt every day is the key to finding love; how February got its name; and why the stock market is sometimes just... down.Finding inspiration in questions from the nature of perfection to the icing on carrot cake, from the deeply familiar to the intoxicatingly imaginative, One More Thing finds its heart in the most human of phenomena: love, fear, family, ambition, and the inner stirring for the one elusive element that might make a person complete.

So he’s built a sneaker factory on one of the islands along with a high-end resort that caters exclusively to the uber-rich.

And the fact that Sir Bentley has been selling off weapons technology to the highest bidders also hasn’t gone unnoticed.

B27321,Discord: More than Beasts - Less than Gods,,English,,"Some Stories must be told and this is one such tale. Ofgrandfather the Wulf and The Garden of Eden, breeding pen, that it was. Bred for what though, Slaves to mine and rape the Earth, our Mother. Are we not her children, Does not Intellect alone, separate us from our Brethren the Beast. The Titans told it true, for we were bred and domesticated, not to have any Natural means of Defense, but our Mind, again why. To Covet first the Apple and then thy Brothers’,for then and only then, did They know, we were ready to be set loose upon the World? Darwin traced it true, water the Origin of our Species. For Silver and Gold do not tarnish, lovely are they to Behold. The Brothers Cain and Abel, For Thought/After Thought, the Parody still Humors me. We had to shed our skin/our defenses, The Snake you say.For what differentiates us from our Brothers the Beasts, the Ability to convey thoughts and actions, the Word. Dowe not domesticate livestock? Institute breeding programs, do we not school Beasts. To do what we cannot or do not wish to do. Could we, not be set upon the same tasks? Do all the old stories tell the same tale? What a story that would be? Would it tell of our Origins and our rise? Would it tell us why, the same Motifs, Echo down the Halls of Time.Would we even now in this day and age accept the Lessons that they teach, Parables, Metaphors? What is the underlining message, what vein runs true? The tale I am about to unfold, may be true. I will let you, judge for yourself. How much Whim, how much Fancy. It begins with the dark and loneliness of Space, so like the depths of our great Oceans. An irony that I hope is not lost on you. Depths we have barely scratched, why I ask is it so. It begins with Slavery and the dissatisfaction thatit brings. It begins with those that first taught us the taste of the Bit, to Yoke the Beast and later thy Brother. We all know, man was Created, but for What, A reflection of Who. Shall I tell you, will these words ever be seen by another? Will they be considered the drug induced ravings of madness? For I have known the Taste of the Needle. The Siren Song of lies she sings, only for you if you have enough. Twirling upon the edge, dancing the Dream, as you dig It in. I only know. I must commit this to paper. In hopes that a more enlightened mind then mine can fathom the possibilities.

How and Why God Evolved highlights the link among pagan, polytheistic, and monotheistic beliefs. Khan points out misrepresentations of Holy Scriptures and discusses some of the political reasons involved. He brings to the forefront the importance of understanding how the notion of God evolved throughout history, in keeping with the human brain’s development. He also shows how God and humans have fashioned each other in an attempt to understand and reach one another.  Khan exposes the textual commonalities among Holy Books and shows how modern-day religions spring from previous religions. How and Why God Evolved discusses why no one religion is truly unique or separate from others. They are all connected deeply by similar rites, rituals, and reasons; all religions share more commonalities than differences.""

He himself worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages. It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Baha’u’llah which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.About the Author",,,10/29/92,August 1st 1993,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Baha I', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Scripture']",,9780877432401,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1215578647l/254660.jpg,4.42,[],197.0,2.0,,254660.The_Kitab_i_Aqdas,,,,,91.0,282.0,315,,Baha'i Pub.

Nel primo racconto, intitolato La casa degli spiriti, due compagni di università, Setsuko e Iwakura, sono legati da un profondo legame di amicizia destinato a trasformarsi in un amore profondo. Il secondo racconto, intitolato Mamma!, parla di un tentativo di avvelenamento ai danni di Matsuoka, una ragazza che lavora in una casa editrice. Matsuoka rimette in discussione il legame con le persone che credeva di amare e decide di tornare per un pò di tempo nel paese natale dove, grazie alla quiete e alle attenzioni della nonna, recupera la fiducia in se stessa e nei rapporti umani. Il terzo racconto è una tragica storia di amicizia tra bambini. Mitsuyo, una scrittrice affermata, ricorda il suo rapporto con Makoto, un amico d'infanzia con il quale trascorreva tutti i pomeriggi dopo la scuola. Nel quarto racconto, che dà il titolo al libro, Tomo è vittima di uno stupro. Sarà l'amore per Misawa, un uomo incontrato per caso alla mensa aziendale, a farle ritrovare la serenità? È quello che si chiede Banana alla fine del racconto, in un'amara riflessione sulla solitudine dell'uomo di fronte al dolore e sulla possibilità o meno di essere felici. L'ultimo racconto, Ricordi da un vicolo cieco, ha come protagonista Mimi, una ragazza che scopre il tradimento del fidanzato. Decide allora di cambiare città per cercare di dimenticarlo e incontra Nishiyama, la felicità: un piatto di riso al curry buonissimo fatto mescolando per caso alcuni ingredienti avanzati, tragicamente impossibile da ripetere una seconda volta con lo stesso, identico sapore.

Bano Qudsia,Raja Gidh / راجه گدھ,,Urdu,,"Raja Gidh (Urdu: راجه گدھ) by Bano Qudsia is one of the most widely read and acclaimed Urdu novels. Gidh is the Urdu word for a vulture and Raja is a Hindi synonym for king. The name anticipates the kingdom of vultures. In fact, parallel to the main plot of the novel, an allegorical story of such a kingdom is narrated. The metaphor of the vulture as an animal feeding mostly on the carcasses of dead animals is employed to portray the trespassing of ethical limits imposed by the society or by the religion.Bano Qudsia has written this novel drawing on the religious concept of Haraam and Halaal. Many readers tend to interpret Raja Gidh as a sermon, in which Bano Qudsia puts forth her theory of hereditary transmission of Haraam genes. Naturally the plot is woven to support the thesis. In the opinion of many readers and critics she manages to convince them that the pursuance of Haraam, be it financial, moral or emotional, results in the deterioration of a person's normality in some sense. She seems to suggest that the abnormality is transferred genetically to the next generation.Apart from the above implication the novel has many social, emotional and psychological aspects. The nostalgic narration of the historical Government College Lahore and of the Lawrence Garden Lahore lights upon the days of seventies and eighties.Bano Qudsia is among those Urdu writers who would think ten times before writing a sentence. But she does not sacrifice the flow of the narrative anywhere in this novel. Her characters are not black and white ones as some of the critics would like to suggest. Every sensitive reader who has attended a college or a university in a Pakistani setting is bound to find some similarities between themselves and one of the characters.Plot: Seemin Shah, hailing from an upper middle class family, falls in love with her handsome class fellow Aftab in the MA Sociology class at Government College Lahore. Seemin is a modern and attractive urban girl and attracts most of her male class fellows, including the narrator (abdul)Qayyum and the young liberal professor Suhail. Aftab belongs to a Kashmiri business family. Though he also loves her, he can not rise above his family values and succumbs to his parent's pressure to marry someone against his wishes and leave for London to look after his family business. Now the long story of separation begins.",,,10/28/81,2015,[],Hardcover,"['Pakistan', 'Fiction', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Psychology']",,9789693505146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340797512l/9632002.jpg,4.18,['Adamjee Literary Award for Urdu Prose (1981)'],466.0,5.0,,9632002-raja-gidh,,,,,92.0,2524.0,564,,Sang-e-Meel Publications,"['1318', '660', '335', '115', '96']",,,[],,

Barbara Brown Taylor,Leaving Church: A Memoir of Faith,,English,,"By now I expected to be a seasoned parish minister, wearing black clergy shirts grown gray from frequent washing. I expected to love the children who hung on my legs after Sunday morning services until they grew up and had children of their own. I even expected to be buried wearing the same red vestments in which I was ordained.Today those vestments are hanging in the sacristy of an Anglican church in Kenya, my church pension is frozen, and I am as likely to spend Sunday mornings with friendly Quakers, Presbyterians, or Congregationalists as I am with the Episcopalians who remain my closest kin. Some-times I even keep the Sabbath with a cup of steaming Assam tea on my front porch, watching towhees vie for the highest perch in the poplar tree while God watches me. These days I earn my living teaching school, not leading worship, and while I still dream of opening a small restaurant in Clarkesville or volunteering at an eye clinic in Nepal, there is no guarantee that I will not run off with the circus before I am through. This is not the life I planned, or the life I recommend to others. But it is the life that has turned out to be mine, and the central revelation in it for me -- that the call to serve God is first and last the call to be fully human -- seems important enough to witness to on paper. This book is my attempt to do that.After nine years serving on the staff of a big urban church in Atlanta, Barbara Brown Taylor arrives in rural Clarkesville, Georgia (population 1,500), following her dream to become the pastor of her own small congregation. The adjustment from city life to country dweller is something of a shock -- Taylor is one of the only professional women in the community -- but small-town life offers many of its own unique joys. Taylor has five successful years that see significant growth in the church she serves, but ultimately she finds herself experiencing ""compassion fatigue"" and wonders what exactly God has called her to do. She realizes that in order to keep her faith she may have to leave.Taylor describes a rich spiritual journey in which God has given her more questions than answers. As she becomes part of the flock instead of the shepherd, she describes her poignant and sincere struggle to regain her footing in the world without her defining collar. Taylor's realization that this may in fact be God's surprising path for her leads her to a refreshing search to find Him in new places. Leaving Church will remind even the most skeptical among us that life is about both disappointment and hope -- and ultimately, renewal.",,,10/30/06,May 1st 2012,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Theology']",,9780060872632,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442861908l/129504._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],100.0,1.0,,129504.Leaving_Church,,,,,93.0,7246.0,251,,HarperOne,"['3016', '2599', '1137', '301', '193']",,,[],,
Barbara Brown Taylor,An Altar in the World: A Geography of Faith,,English,,"In her critically acclaimed Leaving Church (""a beautiful, absorbing memoir.""—Dallas Morning News), Barbara Brown Taylor wrote about leaving full-time ministry to become a professor, a decision that stretched the boundaries of her faith. Now, in her stunning follow-up, An Altar in the World, she shares how she learned to encounter God beyond the walls of any church.  From simple practices such as walking, working, and getting lost to deep meditations on topics like prayer and pronouncing blessings, Taylor reveals concrete ways to discover the sacred in the small things we do and see. Something as ordinary as hanging clothes on a clothesline becomes an act of devotion if we pay attention to what we are doing and take time to attend to the sights, smells, and sounds around us. Making eye contact with the cashier at the grocery store becomes a moment of true human connection. Allowing yourself to get lost leads to new discoveries. Under Taylor's expert guidance, we come to question conventional distinctions between the sacred and the secular, learning that no physical act is too earthbound or too humble to become a path to the divine. As we incorporate these practices into our daily lives, we begin to discover altars everywhere we go, in nearly everything we do.",,,January 1st 2009,February 10th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Memoir', 'Church', 'Christian Living']",,9780061370465,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441049685l/5662443._SX318_.jpg,4.32,"['Rodda Book Award (2012)', 'San Francisco Book Festival for Spiritual (2010)']",34.0,1.0,,5662443-an-altar-in-the-world,,,,,97.0,6951.0,216,,HarperOne,"['3623', '2269', '816', '175', '68']",,,[],,
Barbara Brown Taylor,Holy Envy: Finding God in the Faith of Others,,,,"The renowned and beloved New York Times bestselling author of An Altar in the World and Learning to Walk in the Dark recounts her moving discoveries of finding the sacred in unexpected places while teaching the world’s religions to undergraduates in rural Georgia, revealing how God delights in confounding our expectations.Barbara Brown Taylor continues her spiritual journey begun in Leaving Church of finding out what the world looks like after taking off her clergy collar. In Holy Envy, she contemplates the myriad ways other people and traditions encounter the Transcendent, both by digging deeper into those traditions herself and by seeing them through her students’ eyes as she sets off with them on field trips to monasteries, temples, and mosques. Troubled and inspired by what she learns, Taylor returns to her own tradition for guidance, finding new meaning in old teachings that have too often been used to exclude religious strangers instead of embracing the divine challenges they present. Re-imagining some central stories from the religion she knows best, she takes heart in how often God chooses outsiders to teach insiders how out-of-bounds God really is.Throughout Holy Envy, Taylor weaves together stories from the classroom with reflections on how her own spiritual journey has been complicated and renewed by connecting with people of other traditions—even those whose truths are quite different from hers.  The one constant in her odyssey is the sense that God is the one calling her to disown her version of God—a change that ultimately enriches her faith in other human beings and in God. ",,,March 2019,March 12th 2019,[],ebook,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Faith', 'Christian', 'Memoir', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Biography Memoir', 'Philosophy']",,9780062406583,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1533926080l/35068512.jpg,4.4,[],44.0,1.0,,35068512-holy-envy,,,,,98.0,2575.0,256,,HarperOne,"['1357', '940', '232', '33', '13']",,,[],,

Barbara Delinsky has always had a gift for creating tales of extraordinary emotional power and depth. Now the New York Times bestselling author of Three Wishes surpasses herself once again in a novel that takes readers on a journey as richly textured, colorful, and poignant as the northern California landscape in which the book is set. Rachel Keats and Jack McGill were artists, deeply in love when they married, until the rush of life took its toll. After ten years of marriage, they divorced and went their separate ways. Jack stayed in San Francisco. Rachel moved with their two young daughters to Big Sur. Six years later, an alarming middle-of-the-night phone call demands that Jack put aside his own busy life and career as a leading architect to rush to his ex-wife's hospital bed. While she lies comatose, Jack maintains a bedside vigil and finds himself getting to know Rachel better than he ever did -- through their daughters, her friends, and, even more, through her art. Meanwhile, the beauty and grace of the Redwood canyon where she has made her home also work their own special alchemy upon Jack. He begins to see Rachel, his daughters, and the story of his marriage with new eyes.

Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen, award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station, and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. Demick takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting, we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.  Nothing to Envy is a groundbreaking addition to the literature of totalitarianism and an eye-opening look at a closed world that is of increasing global importance.",,,,December 29th 2009,[],Kindle Edition,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Historical', 'Journalism', 'Memoir']",,B002ZB26AO,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529606621l/40604846._SY475_.jpg,4.42,"['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2010)', 'Ryszard Kapuściński Prize Nominee (2011)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2010)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2010)']",882.0,10.0,,40604846-nothing-to-envy,,,,,98.0,65996.0,338,,Spiegel & Grau,"['36168', '23531', '4920', '852', '525']",,,"[""Korea, Democratic People's Republic of"", ""North Korea (Korea, Democratic People's Republic of)""]",,

"Barbara Eden, Wendy Leigh (Goodreads Author)",Jeannie Out of the Bottle,,English,,"A magical, heartwarming memoir from one of Hollywood’s most beloved icons   Over the past four decades, the landmark NBC hit television series I Dream of Jeannie has delighted generations of audiences and inspired untold numbers of teenage crushes on its beautiful blond star, Barbara Eden. Part pristine Hollywood princess and part classic bombshell, with innocence, strength, and comedic talent to spare, Barbara finally lets Jeannie out of her bottle to tell her whole story. Jeannie Out of the Bottle takes us behind the scenes of I Dream of Jeannie as well as Barbara’s dozens of other stage, movie, television, and live concert performances. We follow her from the hungry years when she was a struggling studio contract player at 20th Century Fox through difficult weeks trying to survive as a chorus girl at Ciro’s Sunset Strip supper club, from a stint as Johnny Carson’s sidekick on live TV to tangling on-screen and off with some of Hollywood’s most desirable leading men, including Elvis Presley, Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman, and Warren Beatty. From the ups and downs of her relationship with her Jeannie co-star Larry Hagman to a touching meeting with an exquisite and vulnerable Marilyn Monroe at the twilight of her career, readers join Barbara on a thrilling journey through her five decades in Hollywood.   But Barbara’s story is also an intimate and honest memoir of personal tragedy: a stillborn child with her first husband, Michael Ansara; a verbally abusive, drug-addicted second husband; the loss of her beloved mother; and the accidental heroin-induced death of her adult son, just months before his wedding. With candor and poignancy, Barbara reflects on the challenges she has faced, as well as the joys she has experienced and how she has maintained her humor, optimism, and inimitable Jeannie magic throughout the roller-coaster ride of a truly memorable life.    Illustrated with sixteen pages of photographs, including candid family pictures and rare publicity stills, Jeannie Out of the Bottle is a must-have for every fan, old and new.",,,01/01/11,April 5th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Tv', 'Audiobook', 'Womens', 'Pop Culture']",,9780307886941,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320423340l/10309013.jpg,3.66,[],72.0,1.0,,10309013-jeannie-out-of-the-bottle,,,,,87.0,2305.0,288,,Crown Archetype,"['614', '670', '719', '234', '68']",,,[],,

In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6-$7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the ""lowliest"" occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity--a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival.

Barbara Ehrenreich,Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream,,English,,"The New York Times bestselling investigation into white-collar unemployment from ""our premier reporter of the underside of capitalism""--The New York Times Book ReviewAmericans' working lives are growing more precarious every day. Corporations slash employees by the thousands, and the benefits and pensions once guaranteed by ""middle-class"" jobs are a thing of the past.In Bait and Switch, Barbara Ehrenreich goes back undercover to explore another hidden realm of the economy: the shadowy world of the white-collar unemployed. Armed with the plausible resume of a professional ""in transition,"" she attempts to land a ""middle-class"" job. She submits to career coaching, personality testing, and EST-like boot camps, and attends job fairs, networking events, and evangelical job-search ministries. She is proselytized, scammed, lectured, and--again and again--rejected.Bait and Switch highlights the people who have done everything right--gotten college degrees, developed marketable skills, and built up impressive resumes--yet have become repeatedly vulnerable to financial disaster. There are few social supports for these newly disposable workers, Ehrenreich discovers, and little security even for those who have jobs. Worst of all, there is no honest reckoning with the inevitable consequences of the harsh new economy; rather, the jobless are persuaded that they have only themselves to blame.Alternately hilarious and tragic, Bait and Switch, like the classic Nickel and Dimed, is a searing expose of the cruel new reality in which we all now live.",,,08/19/05,July 25th 2006,"['Barbara Ehrenreich', 'Patrick Knowles', 'Leah Gray', 'Laiman Godel', 'John D.

Barbara Hodgson,The Tattooed Map,,English,,"At one time, Lydia and Christopher were lovers as well as travel companions; now they are merely fellow travelers. While on a trip to Morocco, Lydia notices a small mark on her hand which begins to grow and spread in thin, tattooed lines that only she can see. Eventually, the marks reveal themselves to be a detailed map of an unknown land, and Lydia begins to understand that these marks, invisible to all but herself and a mysterious Moroccan man named Layesh, will lead her on a strange and perilous journey. The Tattooed Map is Lydia's journal of the days and weeks leading up to her disappearance. Each page contains her daily experiences--her growing shock and fear as the map unfolds itself, her deteriorating relationship with Christopher, her conversations with strangers--as well as the memorabilia she collects along the way: maps and postcards, train tickets and postage stamps, lists of books she's reading and souvenirs she's bought--all pasted in the margins of the journal.  When Lydia disappears midway through the journey, her friend Christopher takes up the journal, using it first as a means of recording his search for her and then, increasingly, as a clue to her fate. A combination travelogue, mystery, and ghost story, The Tattooed Map is a mesmerizing, physically beautiful book.

But the legacy of the Mau Mau rebellion, and the tensions and upheavals of newly independent Kenya, tear their childhood dreams apart. Separated by distance and by family obligation, the three young women are thrown into a larger world of conflicting interests.

Barbara Kingsolver,The Lacuna,,English,,"In her most accomplished novel, Barbara Kingsolver takes us on an epic journey from the Mexico City of artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo to the America of Pearl Harbor, FDR, and J. Edgar Hoover. The Lacuna is a poignant story of a man pulled between two nations as they invent their modern identities. Born in the United States, reared in a series of provisional households in Mexico—from a coastal island jungle to 1930s Mexico City—Harrison Shepherd finds precarious shelter but no sense of home on his thrilling odyssey. Life is whatever he learns from housekeepers who put him to work in the kitchen, errands he runs in the streets, and one fateful day, by mixing plaster for famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. He discovers a passion for Aztec history and meets the exotic, imperious artist Frida Kahlo, who will become his lifelong friend. When he goes to work for Lev Trotsky, an exiled political leader fighting for his life, Shepherd inadvertently casts his lot with art and revolution, newspaper headlines and howling gossip, and a risk of terrible violence. Meanwhile, to the north, the United States will soon be caught up in the internationalist goodwill of World War II. There in the land of his birth, Shepherd believes he might remake himself in America's hopeful image and claim a voice of his own. He finds support from an unlikely kindred soul, his stenographer, Mrs. Brown, who will be far more valuable to her employer than he could ever know. Through darkening years, political winds continue to toss him between north and south in a plot that turns many times on the unspeakable breach—the lacuna—between truth and public presumption. With deeply compelling characters, a vivid sense of place, and a clear grasp of how history and public opinion can shape a life, Barbara Kingsolver has created an unforgettable portrait of the artist—and of art itself. The Lacuna is a rich and daring work of literature, establishing its author as one of the most provocative and important of her time.",,,,November 3rd 2009,"['Leon Trotsky', 'Harrison William Shepherd', 'Frida Kahlo', 'Diego Rivera', 'Violet Brown']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Art', 'Book Club', 'Literature', 'Unfinished', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780060852573,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355810301l/6433752._SY475_.jpg,3.79,"['Orange Prize for Fiction (2010)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction Nominee (2010)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2011)']",896.0,13.0,,6433752-the-lacuna,,,,,87.0,61133.0,508,,Harper,"['18379', '22014', '12977', '5111', '2652']",,,"['Washington, D.C.

She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place.

Barbara Kingsolver,Flight Behavior,,English,,"Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction. Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed. Flight Behavior takes on one of the most contentious subjects of our time: climate change. With a deft and versatile empathy Kingsolver dissects the motives that drive denial and belief in a precarious world.",,,11/01/12,November 6th 2012,['Dellarobia Turnbow'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Environment', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Novels', 'Climate Change', 'Audiobook', 'Nature']",,9780062124265,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352212134l/13438524.jpg,3.78,"['Orion Book Award Nominee (2013)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2013)"", 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2013)', 'Weatherford Award for Fiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2012)']",216.0,3.0,,13438524-flight-behavior,,,,,90.0,83437.0,436,,HarperCollins,"['21746', '32603', '20564', '6317', '2207']",,,"['Feathertown, Tennessee (United States)', 'Appalachia (United States)']",,

As Mildred gets embroiled in the lives of her new neighbors--anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome, dashing husband, Rocky, and Julian Malory, the vicar next door--the novel presents a series of snapshots of human life as actually, and pluckily, lived in a vanishing world of manners and repressed desires.",,,10/28/52,December 26th 2006,"['Mildred Lathbury', 'Helena Napier', 'Rockingham Napier', 'Everard Bone', 'Julian Malory', 'Winifred Malory', 'Allegra Gray', 'Dora Caldicote', 'William Caldicote', 'Sister Blatt', 'Esther Clovis']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Humor', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Womens', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780143104872,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309376675l/178565.jpg,3.92,[],336.0,4.0,,178565.Excellent_Women,,,,,94.0,11111.0,231,,Penguin Classics,"['3230', '4641', '2520', '581', '139']",,,"['London, England']",,
Barbara Robinette Moss,Change Me Into Zeus's Daughter,,English,,"A haunting and triumphant story of a difficult and keenly felt life, ""Change Me into Zeus's Daughter"" is a remarkable literary memoir of resilience, redemption, and growing up in the South. Barbara Robinette Moss was the fourth in a family of eight children raised in the red-clay hills of Alabama. Their wild-eyed, alcoholic father was a charismatic and irrationally proud man who, when sober, captured his children's timid awe, but when (more often) drunk, roused them from bed for severe punishment or bizarre all-night poker games. Their mother was their angel: erudite and stalwart -- her only sin her inability to leave her husband for the sake of the children. Unlike the rest of her family, Barbara bore the scars of this abuse and neglect on the outside as well as the inside. As a result of childhood malnutrition and a complete lack of medical and dental care, the bones in her face grew abnormally (""like a thin pine tree""), and she ended up with what she calls ""a twisted, mummy face."" Barbara's memoir brings us deep into not only the world of Southern poverty and alcoholic child abuse but also the consciousness of one who is physically frail and awkward, relating how one girl's debilitating sense of her own physical appearance is ultimately saved by her faith in the transformative powers of artistic beauty: painting and writing.From early on and with little encouragement from the world, Barbara embodied the fiery determination to change her fate and achieve a life defined by beauty. At age seven, she announced to the world that she would become an artist -- and so she did. Nightly, she prayed to become attractive, to be changed into ""Zeus's daughter,"" the goddess of beauty, and when her prayers weren't answered, she did it herself, raising the money for years of braces followed by facial surgery. Growing up ""so ugly,"" she felt the family's disgrace all the more acutely, but the result has been a keenly developed appreciation for beauty -- physical and artistic -- the evidence of which can be seen in her writing.Despite the deprivation, the lingering image from this memoir is not of self-pity but of the incredible bond between these eight siblings: the raucous, childish fun they had together, the making-do, and the total devotion to their desperate mother, who absorbed most of the father's blows for them and who plied them with art and poetry in place of balanced meals. Gracefully and intelligently woven in layers of flashback, the persistent strength of Barbara Moss's memoir is itself a testament to the nearly lifesaving appreciation for literature that was her mother's greatest gift to her children.",,,,September 12th 2000,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Southern', 'Coming Of Age', 'School', 'Family', 'Poverty']",,9780743202183,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437672951l/1973304.jpg,4.02,['Alabama Author Award for Nonfiction (2002)'],95.0,1.0,,1973304.Change_Me_Into_Zeus_s_Daughter,,,,,95.0,2420.0,320,,Scribner Book Company,"['834', '967', '488', '100', '31']",,,[],,

After her mother’s early death, Iris’s father focuses on big plans for his new shoe stores and his latest girlfriend, and has no time for his daughter. Unbeknownst to her, he hires Iris out as housekeeper and companion for a country doctor’s elderly mother.

So what if she drinks and smokes a bit too much or likes to chat with a fairy godperson who appears to her from time to time? She's the queen of denial and an actress to boot—she can just take on the role of someone she likes better than her sorry self. Regrettably, that role is currently Dorothy in the Little Britches Theater Company's production of The Wizard of Oz.Dorothy on the Rocks is the story of a funny, lovable, totally self-destructive woman who, after a night of one-drink-too-many, wakes up with a strange man in her bed: confident, handsome, sexy, twenty-eight-year-old Jack.

Barrett Tillman,"Whirlwind: The Air War Against Japan, 1942-1945",,English,,"WHIRLWIND is the first book to tell the complete, awe-inspiring story of the Allied air war against Japan--the most important strategic bombing campaign inhistory. From the audacious Doolittle raid in 1942 to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, award-winning historian Barrett Tillman recounts the saga from the perspectives of American and British aircrews who flew unprecedented missions overthousands of miles of ocean, as well as of the generalsand admirals who commanded them.Whether describing the experiences of bomber crews based in China or the Marianas, fighter pilotson Iwo Jima, or carrier aviators at sea, Tillman provides vivid details of the lives of the fliers and their support personnel. ""Whirlwind"" takes readers into the cockpits and gun turrets of the mighty B-29 Superfortress, the largest bomber built up to that time. Tillman dramatically re-creates the sweep of wartime emotions that crews endured on fifteen-hour missions, grappling with the extreme tedium of cramped spaces and with adrenaline spikes in flak-studded skies, knowing that a bailout would put them at the mercy of a merciless enemy or an unforgiving sea.A major character is the controversial and brilliant General Curtis LeMay, who rewrote strategic bombing tactics. His command's fire-bombing missions incinerated fully half of Tokyo and many other cities, crippling Japan's industry while still failing to force surrender.""Whirlwind"" examines the immense logistics and construction efforts necessary to support Superfortresses in Asia and the Mariana Islands, as well as the tireless efforts of engineers to build huge air bases from scratch.It also describes the unheralded missions that American bomber crews flew from the Aleutian Islands to Japan's northernmost Kuril Islands.Never has the Japanese side of the story been so thoroughly examined. If Washington, D.C., represented a ""second front"" in Army-Navy rivalry, the situation in Tokyo approached a full-contact sport. Tillman's description of Japan's willfully inadequate approach to civil defense is eye-opening. Similarly, he examines the mind-set in Tokyo's war cabinet, which ignored the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, requiring the emperor's personal intervention to avert a ghastly Allied invasion.Tillman shows how, despite the Allies' ultimate success, mistakes and shortsighted policies made victory more costly in lives and effort. He faults the lack of a unified command for allowing the Army Air Forces and the Navy to pursue parochial goals at the expense of the larger mission, and he questions the premature commitment of the enormously sophisticated B-29 to the most primitive theater in India and China.""Whirlwind"" is one of the last histories of World War II written with the contribution of men who fought in it.With unexcelled macro- and microperspectives, ""Whirlwind"" is destined to become a standard reference on the war, on multiservice operations, and on the human capacity for individual heroism and national folly.",,,,March 2nd 2010,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'Aviation', 'Military History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Japan', 'Asia', 'American']",,9781416584407,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461010277l/7524258._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],92.0,1.0,,7524258-whirlwind,,,,,94.0,510.0,336,,Simon & Schuster,"['143', '211', '124', '26', '6']",,,[],,

Are we living in exceptionally dangerous times? To watch the news, you'd certainly think so, but Glassner demonstrates that it is our perception of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. The Culture of Fear is an expose of the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as rates for both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV newsmagazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.Glassner spells out the prices we pay for social panics: the huge sums of money that go to waste on unnecessary programs and products as well as time and energy spent worrying about our fears.",,,,2000.0,,,,0465014909,9780465014903,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E6n9rZokBXQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.7,,,,,,,,,,,,210.0,,,,3025.0,,,,

Barry Schwartz,The Paradox of Choice,,,,"About the Book: The Paradox of Choice In the spirit of Alvin Tofflers Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. Whether were buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401K, everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains why too much of a good thing has proven detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz explains how a culture that thrives on the availability of constantly evolving options can also foster profound dissatisfaction and self-blame in individuals, which can lead to a paralysis in decision making and, in some cases, depression. With the latest studies on how we make choices in our personal and professional lives, Schwartz offers practical advice on how to focus on the right choices, and how to derive greater satisfaction from choices that we do make.

Ehrman's inability to reconcile the claims of faith with the facts of real life led the former pastor of the Princeton Baptist Church to reject Christianity.In God's Problem, Ehrman discusses his personal anguish upon discovering the Bible's contradictory explanations for suffering and invites all people of faith—or no faith—to confront their deepest questions about how God engages the world and each of us.",,,,February 19th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Christianity', 'Atheism', 'Theology', 'History', 'Spirituality', 'Christian', 'Audiobook']",,9780061173974,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348084856l/1976714.jpg,3.92,[],53.0,1.0,,1976714.God_s_Problem,,,,,90.0,5081.0,304,,HarperOne,"['1848', '1695', '1018', '323', '197']",,,[],,

"Baruch Spinoza, Edwin M. Curley (Translator), Stuart Hampshire (Introduction), Edwin Curley (Translation)",Ethics,,English,,"Published shortly after his death, the Ethics is undoubtedly Spinoza's greatest work - an elegant, fully cohesive cosmology derived from first principles, providing a coherent picture of reality, and a guide to the meaning of an ethical life. Following a logical step-by-step format, it defines in turn the nature of God, the mind, the emotions, human bondage to the emotions, and the power of understanding - moving from a consideration of the eternal, to speculate upon humanity's place in the natural order, the nature of freedom and the path to attainable happiness. A powerful work of elegant simplicity, the Ethics is a brilliantly insightful consideration of the possibility of redemption through intense thought and philosophical reflection. The Ethics is presented in the standard translation of the work by Edwin Curley.

Basharat Peer,Curfewed Night,,English,,"Since the independence of India, Kashmir has been a major concern for not just India but also the world. The issue of Kashmir still is a crucial issue discussed across forums in the global arena and is one of the major hindrances in improving relationship with India’s neighbour and kin of one time. Much has been written about Kashmir and the separatist movement in Kashmir. But the beautifully scripted account of the brutality with which the separatist movement is carried on till date has no precedence. The book, Curfewed Nights, gives an honest, crude, and truthful account of what goes on in the paradise of India which is under the spell of the separatist movement.The author of the book, Basharat Peer, being a Kashmiri himself has related to each and every detail provided in the book from the first hand experiences gathered by him. Since independence of India, many Kashmiri youths have been mesmerised by the terrorism to the extent that they want to join the terrorist organisations even without thinking about their families or themselves. They have illusioned godfathers in the leaders of such terrorist outfits. In fact, the author was sent out of Kashmir by his family, just to keep him away from these painful romances with the militants.The book, Curfewed Night, has a lot of heart-rending accounts of how a mother watches her son who is forced to hold an exploding bomb or how a poet discovers his religion when his entire family is killed or how the politicians are tortured inside the refurbished torture chambers or how villages have been rigged with landmines which kills innocent civilians, and how temples have converted into army bunkers while ancient Sufi shrines have been decapitated in bomb blasts.",,,,January 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Indian Literature', 'War', 'Pakistan', 'Journalism']",,9788184000344,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1230429736l/6047138.jpg,4.0,"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2010)', 'Crossword Book Award for Nonfiction (2008)']",186.0,2.0,,6047138-curfewed-night,,,,,95.0,3362.0,256,,Random House,"['1044', '1509', '638', '101', '70']",,,['Kashmir'],,

Bassey Ikpi (Goodreads Author),"I'm Telling the Truth, but I'm Lying: Essays",,English,,"A deeply personal collection of essays exploring Nigerian-American author Bassey Ikpi’s experiences navigating Bipolar II and anxiety throughout the course of her life.Bassey Ikpi was born in Nigeria in 1976. Four years later, she and her mother joined her father in Stillwater, Oklahoma —a move that would be anxiety ridden for any child, but especially for Bassey. Her early years in America would come to be defined by tension: an assimilation further complicated by bipolar II and anxiety that would go undiagnosed for decades.By the time she was in her early twenties, Bassey was a spoken word artist and traveling with HBO's Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam, channeling her experiences into art. But something wasn’t right—beneath the façade of the confident performer, Bassey’s mental health was in a precipitous decline, culminating in a breakdown that resulted in hospitalization and a diagnosis of Bipolar II.Determined to learn from her experiences—and share them with others—Bassey became a mental health advocate and has spent the fourteen years since her diagnosis examining the ways mental health is inextricably intertwined with every facet of ourselves and our lives. Viscerally raw and honest, the result is an exploration of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of who we are—and the ways, as honest as we try to be, each of these stories can also be a lie.",,Unabridged,08/06/19,August 20th 2019,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Essays', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Feminism', 'Short Stories', 'Autobiography', 'Mental Illness', 'Africa']",,9780062894786,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1532635261l/40390773._SX318_.jpg,4.33,['Reading Women Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2019)'],100.0,1.0,,40390773-i-m-telling-the-truth-but-i-m-lying,,,,,98.0,2143.0,257,,HarperPerennial,"['1082', '751', '261', '30', '19']",,,[],,

Beatrix Ost,More Than Everything: My Voyage with the Gods of Love,,,,"“Beatrix uses words like she uses paint. . .with brush strokes so vivid and rich I feel as if I’m there watching as her story unfolds. I love this book!” –Sissy SpacekBeatrix Ost’s memoir of her artistic awakening and early marriage opens on the heels of Germany’s recovery from the self-imposed disasters of World War II. She is part of the new generation that dances disobediently in the bombed-out villas and underground jazz caverns of Munich. Beatrix rides the dynamic decade up through the world of art, fashion, and cinema into the revolution of politics and consciousness.Marriage to the self-made prodigy and archaeologist, Ferdinand, impresario of the Hot Club, draws her into the mystical realm of the ancient Mexican gods. Soon, two sons are born. They make an odyssey through Mexico where, under the wing of the artistic elite, their homes full of Riveras and Kahlos, the initial impression is intoxicating. But the further they press inland, the more Ferdinand loses himself in his obsession and addictions.Ost draws us into the vortex of human craving to portray the complexities of her early marriage to a man scarred by the war, climbing the magical mountain of his own desires.Accompanied by the author’s artwork and photographs from her private collection, Ost “…shakes free of an impossibly dark life as the wife of an alcoholic…brushes off the stardust of romance and, stepping back in the light, comes into her own.” (Barbara Epler, President, New Directions Publishing)",,,,April 4th 2017,[],Paperback,[],,9781933527901,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475300679l/31945112._SX318_.jpg,4.75,[],100.0,1.0,,31945112-more-than-everything,,,,,100.0,4.0,280,,Turtle Point Press,[],,,[],,

To atone for sins from her forgotten past, and earn back the respect of the people she loves, she decides to show the world that alchemy can be used for good. For healing.

“I can tell you that some force within me rejected death at the last moment and then guided me, blind and stumbling—quite literally a dead man walking—into camp and the shaky start of my return to life.”  In 1996 Beck Weathers and a climbing team pushed toward the summit of Mount Everest. Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, and caked with ice—walking down the mountain. In this powerful memoir, now featuring a new Preface, Weathers describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed eight climbers, but the journey of his life. This is the story of a man’s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since; of survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life; and of the most extraordinary adventure of all: finding the courage to say yes when life offers us a second chance.  Praise for Left for Dead  “Riveting . . . [a] remarkable survival story . . .

Bell Hooks,All About Love: New Visions,,English,,"All About Love offers radical new ways to think about love by showing its interconnectedness in our private and public lives. In eleven concise chapters, hooks explains how our everyday notions of what it means to give and receive love often fail us, and how these ideals are established in early childhood. She offers a rethinking of self-love (without narcissism) that will bring peace and compassion to our personal and professional lives, and asserts the place of love to end struggles between individuals, in communities, and among societies. Moving from the cultural to the intimate, hooks notes the ties between love and loss and challenges the prevailing notion that romantic love is the most important love of all.Visionary and original, hooks shows how love heals the wounds we bear as individuals and as a nation, for it is the cornerstone of compassion and forgiveness and holds the power to overcome shame.For readers who have found ongoing delight and wisdom in bell hooks's life and work, and for those who are just now discovering her, All About Love is essential reading and a brilliant book that will change how we think about love, our culture-and one another.",Love Trilogy,,,December 22nd 1999,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Love', 'Psychology', 'Essays', 'Relationships', 'Womens', 'Social Justice']",,9780688168445,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387754966l/17607.jpg,4.05,[],148.0,2.0,,17607.All_About_Love,,,,,92.0,17232.0,240,,William Morrow,"['7010', '5691', '3116', '1127', '288']",,,[],,

But to know love, men must be able to look at the ways that patriarchal culture keeps them from knowing themselves, from being in touch with their feelings, from loving. In The Will to Change, bell hooks gets to the heart of the matter and shows men how to express the emotions that are a fundamental part of who they are -- whatever their age, marital status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.  With trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves -- and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women.

Bell Hooks,Killing Rage: Ending Racism,,English,,"One of our country's premier cultural and social critics, bell hooks has always maintained that eradicating racism and eradicating sexism must go hand in hand. But whereas many women have been recognized for their writing on gender politics, the female voice has been all but locked out of the public discourse on race.Killing Rage speaks to this imbalance. These twenty-three essays are written from a black and feminist perspective, and they tackle the bitter difficulties of racism by envisioning a world without it. They address a spectrum of topics having to do with race and racism in the United States: psychological trauma among African Americans; friendship between black women and white women; anti-Semitism and racism; and internalized racism in movies and the media. And in the title essay, hooks writes about the ""killing rage""—the fierce anger of black people stung by repeated instances of everyday racism—finding in that rage a healing source of love and strength and a catalyst for positive change.bell hooks is Distinguished Professor of English at City College of New York.

But even though he knows loving Sophie Sullivan isn’t the right thing to do...how can he possibly resist?  Sophie Sullivan, a librarian in San Francisco, was five years old when she fell head over heels in love with Jake McCann. Twenty years later, she’s convinced the notorious bad boy still sees her as the “nice” Sullivan twin. That is, when he bothers to look at her at all. But when they both get caught up in the magic of the first Sullivan wedding, she knows it’s long past time to do whatever it takes to make him see her for who she truly is...the woman who will love him forever.  Jake has always been a magnet for women, especially since his Irish pubs made him extremely wealthy. But the only woman he really wants is the one he can never have. Not only is Sophie his best friend’s off-limits younger sister...he can’t risk letting her get close enough to discover his deeply hidden secret.  Only, when Sophie appears on his doorstep as Jake’s every fantasy come to life—smart, beautiful, and shockingly sexy—he doesn’t have a prayer of taking his eyes, or his hands, off her. And he can’t stop craving more of her sweet smiles and sinful kisses. Because even though Jake knows loving Sophie isn’t the right thing to do...how can he possibly resist?

  Curl up with Prince Theon this Christmas...

  
    
  
Nineteen year old Penelope ""Nell"" O'Hara is geared up for the worst Christmas of her life. The guy she's been dating just dumped her for her best friend, and all she has to look forward to over the break is a stay in Beggar's Hole--a tiny frozen town on the coast of Maine--with her retired father, his latest masseuse girlfriend and her brattish fourteen year old son. But one night, after storming out of dinner to take a brooding walk among the rocks, a misstep on the ice causes Nell's Christmas to take rather a different turn...  She would have died, were it not for a mysterious, heat-exuding hero arriving out of nowhere to scoop her up in his arms, and warm and dry her body. Coming to, Nell finds herself staring up into a pair of deep gold eyes. Eyes belonging to a man who is quite unlike any she's seen before. His features are chiseled yet sensual, exotic but somber, like something beautiful and wild threatened by extinction. All of six and a half feet tall, and two hundred plus pounds of pure muscle, her savior introduces himself as Theon Aena. His mere touch sends heat surging through her body, reaching down into her fingers and toes, even fluttering from her hair follicles, and his proximity to her brings about strange shudders of pleasure.After a twist of fate causes her to cross paths with Theon again, Nell's drab, frozen Christmas soon spirals into a firestorm of passion, romance, revelations, and danger...

Belle Winters (Goodreads Author),The Librarian,,English,,"Siarra Sweet, smart, innocent Addilyn. The little nine year old girl that frequents the library that I work in. Who knew that dropping her off home one day after work would change everything? Well that was how I met him – Psycho – Addie’s father. What else? Well, he just happened to be the president of the local motorcycle club the Rulers of Darkness who was known for their not so legal activities and the danger surrounding them. The issue? He wants his daughter in his life and so do I. I was committed to her after all of these years goddamit and he was practically a stranger. Neither of us are willing to bend so now we must coexist. It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for the constant teasing about my choice in clothes or my glasses or the way I liked books and learning. That was the least of it. Having to be around a man that aggravated me, tried to boss me around, tell me what to do and how to do it, and drove me - MAKE ME WANT TO SCREAM - out of my mind was pure hell. Not to mention he was my god, hot damn, sexy and made me have all types of thoughts that were totally irrational and out of line. I mean, how can I fantasize about someone I absolutely couldn’t stand? I’ll keep all my dreams – or should I say nightmares – to myself. If I happen to enjoy them in the moment then fine, but I was not going to cross that line with him. Nope.  Psycho Siarra, the little pain in my butt nut job. The girl was a bonafide pint sized crazy person. Most times, I couldn’t decide whether I wanted to brain her or bang her brains out. My little girl was crazy about her, therefore I couldn’t quite get rid of her and bury the body… no matter how much she made me want to. The little librarian nerd had a temper that outrivaled some men. Heck, she’s scared a few of the toughest I know. What’s my biggest problem with her you wanna know right? Her dorky glasses, tight as sin teddy bear pajamas – sans bra, fiery attitude, and fierce protectiveness made me crazy. I was constantly horny around her and I knew that I needed to stay away from her because if I had her I was gonna own her. That wouldn’t work out so well with the whole Addie thing being in the middle. She made my inner caveman come out at all times. But it aint gonna happen, I can hold back. Now, me keeping myself from strangling her is a promise I don’t know if I can keep…",The Rulers of Darkness MC #1,,,November 23rd 2017,[],Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Motorcycle', 'Abuse', 'Action', 'Erotica']",,B0784GMG3P,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511540024l/36653644._SY475_.jpg,3.94,[],56.0,1.0,,36653644-the-librarian,,,,,90.0,1554.0,387,,,"['601', '477', '316', '102', '58']",,,[],,

"Belsebuub (Goodreads Author), Belsebuub (Goodreads Author)",The Path of the Spiritual Sun: Celebrating the Solstices and Equinoxes,,English,,"The ancient veneration of the sun is one of the greatest celebrations in history. It has been encoded in sacred texts and sites by peoples separated by vast distances for thousands of years across the world.Although often looked at as simple-minded sun-worshipers, there is another reason why the ancients aligned some of their most inexplicable and advanced sites to the sun and stars, and encoded the movements of the heavens in their sacred teachings.The sun, source of all light and life, is central to a cosmic spirituality that is both ancient and timeless—and as ever-present as always. Its principles have formed the basis of many of the world’s religions—unbeknownst even to many of those who follow them—and are just as relevant to people searching for spirituality today.The Path of the Spiritual Sun by Belsebuub uncovers the profound spiritual significance of the veneration of the sun, pulling together the sites, texts, traditions, and symbols from around the world that were based on the solar cycle to reveal the common thread of spirituality running like a current of eternal knowledge through all of them and imbued in the very fabric of creation itself.Contains a guide with ceremonies and mantras to celebrate the solstices and equinoxes based on ancient practices from around the worldIn The Path of the Spiritual Sun, Belsebuub has created a comprehensive and practical guide to the celebration of the sun.

For her he would give up everything--his home, his distinguished career, and his freedom. When his flawed marriage begins to fail, a choice must be made. Shall heconsider a step that would force him into flight and a life of hiding? From her earliest years, Tina is exceptional, a brilliant student and a joyous, loving spirit. At the university she falls in love with Gilbert, who graduates from law school just as she is about to enter medical school. Together they go to New York, where she learns the truth about her family's past, a truth that must change her regard for the father who has protected and cherished her. When a terrible lie has been told out of love, can it be forgiven? With courage and compassion, Belva Plain paints a moving portrait of the choices that shape the course of our lives, the secrets that haunt us, and the love that helps us heal and move on.

"Ben Carson, Cecil Murphey",Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,,English,,"Gifted Hands by and about Ben Carson, M.D., is the inspiring story of an inner-city kid with poor grades and little motivation, who, at age thirty-three, became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Gifted Hands will transplace you into the operating room to witness surgeries that made headlines around the world, and into the private mind of a compassionate, God-fearing physician who lives to help others. In 1987, Dr. Carson gained worldwide recognition for his part in the first successful separation of Siamese twins joined at the back of the head -- an extremely complex and delicate operation that was five months of planning and twenty-two hours of actual surgery, involving a surgical plan that Carson helped initiate. Gifted Hands reveals a man with humility, decency, compassion, courage, and sensitivity who serves as a role model for young people (and everyone else) in need of encouragement to attempt the seemingly impossible and to excel in whatever they attempt. Dr. Carson also describes the key role that his highly intelligent though relatively uneducated mother played in his metamorphosis from an unmotivated ghetto youngster into one of the most respected neurosurgeons in the world.",,,02/10/92,November 26th 1996,"['Ben Carson', 'Sonya Carson', 'Robert Solomon Carson', 'Lacena Rustin Carson']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Christian', 'Inspirational', 'African American']",,9780310214694,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331248043l/18422.jpg,4.18,[],192.0,2.0,,18422.Gifted_Hands,,,,,94.0,16553.0,224,,Zondervan,"['7690', '5460', '2416', '635', '352']",,,[],,

Along the way he has written major stories for American outlets, including a remarkable New York Times Magazine cover story. Now comes the powerful new work that has always been his ultimate goal, The Way to the Spring.We are familiar with brave journalists who travel to bleak or war-torn places on a mission to listen and understand, to gather the stories of people suffering from extremes of oppression and want: Katherine Boo, Ryszard Kapuściński, Ted Conover, and Philip Gourevitch among them. Palestine is, by any measure, whatever one's politics, one such place. Ruled by the Israeli military, set upon and harassed constantly by Israeli settlers who admit unapologetically to wanting to drive them from the land, forced to negotiate an ever more elaborate and more suffocating series of fences, checkpoints, and barriers that have sundered home from field, home from home, this is a population whose living conditions are unique, and indeed hard to imagine.

Ben Goldacre,Bad Science,,English,,"Full of spleen, this is a hilarious, invigorating and informative journey through the world of Bad Science. When Dr Ben Goldacre saw someone on daytime TV dipping her feet in an 'Aqua Detox' footbath, releasing her toxins into the water, turning it brown, he thought he'd try the same at home. 'Like some kind of Johnny Ball cum Witchfinder General', using his girlfriend's Barbie doll, he gently passed an electrical current through the warm salt water. It turned brown.

"Ben Jonson, Robert N. Watson (Editor)",Volpone,,English,,"Volphone's reverential prayer to his heaps of gold launches the sharpest, funniest play about money and morals in the 17th century - a play still wickedly relevant on the same topics four centuries later. Ben Jonson's comedy depicts selfishness thinly veiled by sanctimonious speeches, lust and possessiveness poorly disguised as love and marriage, and cynical legalism passing itself off as pure justice, alongside snobbery, class warfare and greed. The wily protagonists keep a dozen conventional plots spinning in the minds of their dupes, and when their amazing juggling act finally unravels, there are yet more twists - and an even deeper cynicisim - to the story. The play is partly a beast-fable: the wily fox, Volpone, plays dead to lure flesh-eating birds that he can then consume. But the beasts are the human race, and polite society the biggest, greediest scam of them all.This student edition contains a lengthy Introduction with background on the author, date and sources, critical interpretation and stage history.Robert N.

Ben Macintyre,"Agent Zigzag: A True Story of Nazi Espionage, Love, and Betrayal",,English,,"Eddie Chapman was a charming criminal, a con man, and a philanderer. He was also one of the most remarkable double agents Britain has ever produced. Inside the traitor was a man of loyalty; inside the villain was a hero. The problem for Chapman, his spymasters, and his lovers was to know where one persona ended and the other began.In 1941, after training as a German spy in occupied France, Chapman was parachuted into Britain with a revolver, a wireless, and a cyanide pill, with orders from the Abwehr to blow up an airplane factory. Instead, he contacted MI5, the British Secret Service. For the next four years, Chapman worked as a double agent, a lone British spy at the heart of the German Secret Service who at one time volunteered to assassinate Hitler for his countrymen. Crisscrossing Europe under different names, all the while weaving plans, spreading disinformation, and, miraculously, keeping his stories straight under intense interrogation, he even managed to gain some profit and seduce beautiful women along the way.The Nazis feted Chapman as a hero and awarded him the Iron Cross. In Britain, he was pardoned for his crimes, becoming the only wartime agent to be thus rewarded. Both countries provided for the mother of his child and his mistress. Sixty years after the end of the war, and ten years after Chapman’s death, MI5 has now declassified all of Chapman’s files, releasing more than 1,800 pages of top secret material and allowing the full story of Agent Zigzag to be told for the first time.A gripping story of loyalty, love, and treachery, Agent Zigzag offers a unique glimpse into the psychology of espionage, with its thin and shifting line between fidelity and betrayal.",,,,September 4th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'Espionage', 'War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Military Fiction', 'Adventure']",,9780307353405,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320497271l/655627.jpg,4.1,[],246.0,4.0,,655627.Agent_Zigzag,,,,,97.0,12277.0,364,,Crown,"['4254', '5485', '2141', '302', '95']",,,[],,
Ben Macintyre,Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies,,English,,"In his celebrated bestsellers Agent Zigzag and Operation Mincemeat, Ben Macintyre told the dazzling true stories of a remarkable WWII double agent and of how the Allies employed a corpse to fool the Nazis and assure a decisive victory.  In Double Cross, Macintyre returns with the untold story of the grand final deception of the war and of the extraordinary spies who achieved it.   On June 6, 1944, 150,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy and suffered an astonishingly low rate of casualties.  D-Day was a stunning military accomplishment, but it was also a masterpiece of trickery. Operation Fortitude, which protected and enabled the invasion, and the Double Cross system, which specialized in turning German spies into double agents, deceived the Nazis into believing that the Allies would attack at Calais and Norway rather than Normandy. It was the most sophisticated and successful deception operation ever carried out, ensuring that Hitler kept an entire army awaiting a fake invasion, saving thousands of lives, and securing an Allied victory at the most critical juncture in the war.   The story of D-Day has been told from the point of view of the soldiers who fought in it, the tacticians who planned it, and the generals who led it. But this epic event in world history has never before been told from the perspectives of the key individuals in the Double Cross System. These include its director (a brilliant, urbane intelligence officer), a colorful assortment of MI5 handlers (as well as their counterparts in Nazi intelligence), and the five spies who formed Double Cross’s nucleus: a dashing  Serbian playboy, a Polish fighter-pilot, a bisexual Peruvian party girl, a deeply eccentric Spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming and a volatile Frenchwoman, whose obsessive love for her pet dog very nearly wrecked the entire plan. The D-Day spies were, without question, one of the oddest military units ever assembled, and their success depended on the delicate, dubious relationship between spy and spymaster, both German and British. Their enterprise was saved from catastrophe by a shadowy sixth spy whose heroic sacrifice is revealed here for the first time.   With the same depth of research, eye for the absurd and masterful storytelling that have made Ben Macintyre an international bestseller,  Double Cross is a captivating narrative of the spies who wove a web so intricate it ensnared Hitler’s army and carried thousands of D-Day troops across the Channel in safety.",,,03/27/12,July 31st 2012,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Espionage', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History']",,9780307990440,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344370635l/13154628.jpg,3.93,"['Agatha Award Nominee for Best Nonfiction (2012)', 'Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2012)']",82.0,1.0,,13154628-double-cross,,,,,94.0,9020.0,399,,Broadway Books,"['2652', '3770', '2037', '438', '123']",,,[],,
"Ben Macintyre, John le Carré (Afterword)",A Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal,,English,,"Master storyteller Ben Macintyre’s most ambitious work to date offers a powerful new angle on the twentieth century’s greatest spy storyKim Philby was the greatest spy in history, a brilliant and charming man who rose to head Britain’s counterintelligence against the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War—while he was secretly working for the enemy. And nobody thought he knew Philby like Nicholas Elliott, Philby’s best friend and fellow officer in MI6. The two men had gone to the same schools, belonged to the same exclusive clubs, grown close through the crucible of wartime intelligence work and long nights of drink and revelry. It was madness for one to think the other might be a communist spy, bent on subverting Western values and the power of the free world. But Philby was secretly betraying his friend. Every word Elliott breathed to Philby was transmitted back to Moscow—and not just Elliott’s words, for in America, Philby had made another powerful friend: James Jesus Angleton, the crafty, paranoid head of CIA counterintelligence. Angleton's and Elliott’s unwitting disclosures helped Philby sink almost every important Anglo-American spy operation for twenty years, leading countless operatives to their doom. Even as the web of suspicion closed around him, and Philby was driven to greater lies to protect his cover, his two friends never abandoned him—until it was too late. The stunning truth of his betrayal would have devastating consequences on the two men who thought they knew him best, and on the intelligence services he left crippled in his wake. Told with heart-pounding suspense and keen psychological insight, and based on personal papers and never-before-seen British intelligence files, A Spy Among Friends is Ben Macintyre’s best book yet, a high-water mark in Cold War history telling.From the Hardcover edition.",,,,March 3rd 2014,"['Nicholas Elliott', 'Guy Burgess', 'James Jesus Angleton', 'Harold Philby', 'Donald Maclean', 'Aileen Philby', 'Eleanor Philby']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Espionage', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Russia', 'Politics', 'Historical']",,9781408851722,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389716939l/20543546.jpg,4.12,"['Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2014)']",55.0,1.0,,20543546-a-spy-among-friends,,,,,95.0,15637.0,368,,Bloomsbury,"['5957', '6674', '2264', '464', '278']",,,"['London, England', 'Washington, D.C.

Ben Mezrich (Goodreads Author),"The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal",,English,,"The high-energy tale of how two socially awkward Ivy Leaguers, trying to increase their chances with the opposite sex, ended up creating Facebook.Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg were Harvard undergraduates and best friends–outsiders at a school filled with polished prep-school grads and long-time legacies. They shared both academic brilliance in math and a geeky awkwardness with women.Eduardo figured their ticket to social acceptance–and sexual success–was getting invited to join one of the university’s Final Clubs, a constellation of elite societies that had groomed generations of the most powerful men in the world and ranked on top of the inflexible hierarchy at Harvard. Mark, with less of an interest in what the campus alpha males thought of him, happened to be a computer genius of the first order.Which he used to find a more direct route to social stardom: one lonely night, Mark hacked into the university's computer system, creating a ratable database of all the female students on campus–and subsequently crashing the university's servers and nearly getting himself kicked out of school. In that moment, in his Harvard dorm room, the framework for Facebook was born.What followed–a real-life adventure filled with slick venture capitalists, stunning women, and six-foot-five-inch identical-twin Olympic rowers–makes for one of the most entertaining and compelling books of the year. Before long, Eduardo’s and Mark’s different ideas about Facebook created in their relationship faint cracks, which soon spiraled into out-and-out warfare. The collegiate exuberance that marked their collaboration fell prey to the adult world of lawyers and money. The great irony is that while Facebook succeeded by bringing people together, its very success tore two best friends apart.The Accidental Billionaires is a compulsively readable story of innocence lost–and of the unusual creation of a company that has revolutionized the way hundreds of millions of people relate to one another.Ben Mezrich, a Harvard graduate, has published ten books, including the New York Times bestseller Bringing Down the House. He is a columnist for Boston Common and a contributor for Flush magazine. Ben lives in Boston with his wife, Tonya.

This time he caught Peter Driscal in the parking lot and smashed his head against the sidewalk. Now, Peter may have permanent brain damage and Cole is in the biggest trouble of his life.Cole is offered Circle Justice: a system based on Native American traditions that attempts to provide healing for the criminal offender, the victim, and the community. With prison as his only alternative, Cole plays along. He says he wants to repent, but in his heart, Cole blames his alcoholic mom, his abusive dad, wimpy Peter (everyone but himself) for his situation.Cole receives a one-year banishment to a remote Alaskan island. There, he is mauled by a mysterious white bear of Native American legend. Hideously injured, Cole waits for death. His thoughts shift from anger to humility. To survive, he must stop blaming others and take responsibility for his life. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's body, but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that may save his soul.Ben Mikaelsen paints a vivid picture of a juvenile offender, examining the roots of his anger without absolving him of responsibility for his actions, and questioning a society in which angry people make victims of their peers and communities.

Like Shawn often does, readers of this work may find themselves in uncharted territory, while at the same time discovering how one can learn lessons and experience growth in the most unlikely of places, even in a city many people believe to be shallower than a puddle.

Ben Shapiro,The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great,,,,"
  America has a God-shaped hole in its heart, argues New York Times bestselling author Ben Shapiro, and we shouldn't fill it with politics and hate.
In 2016, Ben Shapiro spoke at UC Berkeley. Hundreds of police officers were required from 10 UC campuses across the state to protect his speech, which was -- ironically -- about the necessity for free speech and rational debate. He came to argue that Western Civilization is in the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas. Our freedoms are built upon the twin notions that every human being is made in God’s image and that human beings were created with reason capable of exploring God’s world. We can thank these values for the birth of science, the dream of progress, human rights, prosperity, peace, and artistic beauty. Jerusalem and Athens built America, ended slavery, defeated the Nazis and the Communists, lifted billions from poverty and gave billions spiritual purpose. Jerusalem and Athens were the foundations of the Magna Carta and the Treaty of Westphalia; they were the foundations of Declaration of Independence, Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, and Martin Luther King Jr.’s Letter from Birmingham Jail.Civilizations that rejected Jerusalem and Athens have collapsed into dust. The USSR rejected Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, substituting a new utopian vision of “social justice” – and they starved and slaughtered tens of millions of human beings. The Nazis rejected Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, and they shoved children into gas chambers. Venezuela rejects Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, and citizens of their oil-rich nation have been reduced to eating dogs.  We are in the process of abandoning Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, favoring instead moral subjectivism and the rule of passion. And we are watching our civilization collapse into age-old tribalism, individualistic hedonism, and moral subjectivism. We believe we can reject Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law and satisfy ourselves with intersectionality, or scientific materialism, or progressive politics, or authoritarian governance, or nationalistic solidarity. We can’t.The West is special, and in The Right Side of History, Ben Shapiro bravely explains that it’s because too many of us have lost sight of the moral purpose that drives us each to be better, or the sacred duty to work together for the greater good, or both. A stark warning, and a call to spiritual arms, this book may be the first step in getting our civilization back on track.

Benedict Anderson,Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (Revised Edition),,English,,"What makes people love and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name? While many studies have been written on nationalist political movements, the sense of nationality--the personal and cultural feeling of belonging to a nation--has not received proportionate attention. In this widely acclaimed work, Benedict Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the 'imagined communities' of nationality.Anderson explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kingship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of vernacular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was modularly adopted by popular movements in Europe, by the imperialist powers, and by the anti-imperialist resistances in Asia and Africa.This revised edition includes two new chapters, one of which discusses the complex role of the colonialist state's mindset in the develpment of Third World nationalism, while the other analyses the processes by which, all over the world, nations came to imagine themselves as old.",,,05/28/83,July 17th 1991,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Theory', 'Political Science', 'Academic', 'Social Science']",,9780860915461,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577166498l/399136._SY475_.jpg,4.11,[],287.0,3.0,,399136.Imagined_Communities,,,,,96.0,11264.0,224,,Verso/New Left Books Ltd.,"['4268', '4524', '1998', '369', '105']",,,"['South America', 'Asia', 'Africa']",,

"Benito Pérez Galdós, Agnes Moncy Gullón (Translator, Introduction)",Fortunata and Jacinta,,English,,"Capturing a ninteenth-century Spanish world of political tumult and personal obsession, Benito Pérez Galdós's Fortunata and Jacinta tells of two women who love the same man unfailingly—one as his mistress, the other as his wife.In this new and complete translation, Agnes Moncy Gullón presents the detailed realism, the diversity of character and scene that have placed Fortunata and Jacinta alongside the voluminous works of Charles Dickens and Honoré de Balzac. Galdós's Madrid, recast from his youthful wanderings through the city's slums and cafés, includes the egg sellers and faded bullfighters surrounding Fortunata as well as the quieter, sequestered milieu of Jacinta's upbringing. Through Juanito, the lover of both women, the writer reveals Spain as a variegated fabric of delicate traditions and established vices, of shaky politics and rich intrigue. In this vast and colorful world, resonant of Dickens's London and Balzac's France, Galdós presents his characters with a depth, ambiguity, and humor born of the multiplicity of his scene.Galdós's novels enjoyed, for a time, a wide and attentive readership in Spain. As his reputation grew, however, hostility toward his achievements, envy of his success, and political squabbling hampered his progress, stalling his election to the Royal Academy and, in 1912, thoroughly derailing his nomination as Spain's candidate for the Nobel Prize.Though the political controversies that surrounded Galdós's works have long been calmed, this translation by Agnes Moncy Gullón brings alive the tempestuous era in which he lived and wrote, allowing English readers to hear the percussive yet often melodic tones of nineteenth-century Madrid in the correct and casual speech of Jacinta, in the pretty but empty words of Juanito, and in the painfully proper, sometimes vulgar language of Fortunata.",,,10/30/87,September 5th 1988,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Spain', 'Spanish Literature', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classic Literature']",,9780140433050,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365411543l/1118206.jpg,4.18,[],119.0,2.0,,1118206.Fortunata_and_Jacinta,,,,,93.0,1439.0,818,,Penguin Classics,"['705', '418', '216', '68', '32']",,,['Madrid (Spain)'],,

Here was a cosmopolitan statesman, public servant, inventor, and editor with a distinctly Yankee sensibility; here was a moral philosopher who divided his faith between the natural sciences and the American experiment.This volume includes Franklin's reflections on such diverse issues as reason and religion, social status, electricity, America's national character and characters, war, and the societal status of women. Also included is a new transcription of his 1726 journal, and several pieces that have only recently been identified as Franklin's work.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

"Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd, Charles Tatham",Security Analysis: Principles and Technique,,English,,"With nearly a million copies sold, Security Analysis has been continuously in print for more than sixty years. No investment book in history had either the immediate impact, or the long-term relevance and value, of its first edition in 1934. By 1951, seventeen years past its original publication and more than a decade beyond its revised and acclaimed 1940 second edition, authors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd had seen business and investment markets travel from the depths of Depression to the heights of recovery, and had observed investor behavior during both the calm of peacetime and the chaos of World War II.The prescient thinking and insight displayed by Graham and Dodd in the first two editions of Security Analysis reached new heights in the third edition. In words that could just as easily have been written today as fifty years ago, they detail techniques and strategies for attaining success as individual investors, as well as the responsibilities of corporate decision makers to build shareholder value and transparency for those investors.The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century.Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 Edition marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.",,,10/29/34,December 31st 2004,[],Hardcover,"['Finance', 'Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Money', 'Personal Finance', 'Buisness', 'Reference', 'Classics', 'Education']",,9780071448208,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172646390l/203409._SY475_.jpg,4.34,[],198.0,2.0,,203409.Security_Analysis,,,,,96.0,7199.0,770,,McGraw-Hill Education,"['4037', '1999', '851', '211', '101']",,,[],,

Learning of Bruno's ability to speak, Lydia takes Bruno into her home to oversee his education and nurture his passion for painting. But for all of his gifts, the chimpanzee has a rough time caging his more primal urges.

He spends his days cheating death in the skies above the Mojave Desert and his nights at his friend Pancho's bar, often with his wife, Grace. She and Harrison are secretly desperate for a child-and when, against all odds, Grace learns that she is pregnant, the two are overcome with joy.While America becomes swept up in the fervor of the Space Race, Harrison turns his attention home, passing up the chance to become an astronaut to welcome his daughter, Florence, into the world.

But when his family is faced with a sudden and inexplicable tragedy, Harrison's instincts as a father and a pilot are put to test. As a pilot, he feels compelled to lead them through it-and as a father, he fears that he has fallen short.The aftermath will haunt the Harrisons and strain their marriage as Jim struggles under the weight of his decisions. Beginning when the dust of the Second World War has only just begun to settle and rushing onward into the Sixties, Benjamin Johncock traces the path of this young couple as they are uprooted by events much larger than themselves. The turns the Harrisons take together are at once astonishing and recognizable; their journey, both frightening and full of hope. Set against the backdrop of one of the most emotionally charged periods in American history, The Last Pilot is a mesmerizing debut novel of loss and finding courage in the face of it from an extraordinary new talent.",,First Edition,06/30/15,July 7th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Space', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'American']",,9781250066640,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430317694l/22857253.jpg,3.65,[],69.0,1.0,,22857253-the-last-pilot,,,,,89.0,1153.0,298,,Picador,"['227', '455', '346', '95', '30']",,,[],,

To explain how and why this has come about, Barber brings together extensive empirical research with an original theoretical framework for understanding our contemporary predicament.

We just said we were going to publish a few books on the side at random. Let’s call it Random House.” So recounts Bennett Cerf in this wonderfully amusing memoir of the making of a great publishing house. An incomparable raconteur, possessed of an irrepressible wit and an abiding love of books and authors, Cerf brilliantly evokes the heady days of Random House’s first decades.  Part of the vanguard of young New York publishers who revolutionized the book business in the 1920s and ’30s, Cerf helped usher in publishing’s golden age. Cerf was a true personality, whose other pursuits (columnist, anthologist, author, lecturer, radio host, collector of jokes and anecdotes, perennial judge of the Miss America pageant, and panelist on What’s My Line?) helped shape his reputation as a man of boundless energy and enthusiasm and brought unprecedented attention to his company and to his authors.

Benson Bobrick,Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution it Inspired,,English,,"Next to the Bible itself, the English Bible was-and is-the most influential book ever published. The most famous of all English Bibles, the King James Version was the culmination of centuries of work by various translators, from John Wycliffe, the fourteenth-century initiator of English Bible translation, to the committee of scholars who collaborated on the King James translation. ""Wide as the Waters"" examines the life and work of Wycliffe and recounts the tribulations of his successors, including William Tyndale, who was martyred, Miles Coverdale, and others who came to bitter ends, as well as the fifty-four scholars from Oxford and Cambridge who crafted the King James Version of the Bible.  Historian Benson Bobrick traces this story through the tumultuous reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary Tudor, and Elizabeth I, a time of fierce contest between Catholics and Protestants in England.  Once people were free to interpret the word of God, they began to question the authority of their inherited institutions, both religious and secular. This led to reformation within the Church, and to the rise of constitutional government in England and the end of the divine right of kings.  ""Wide as the Waters"" is a story about a crucial epoch in the development of Christianity, about the English language and society, and about a book that changed the course of history.  ""Bobrick is an exceptionally able writer of popular histories. . . . This new book is by far his most ambitious. . . . He succeeds entirely in the challenge he sets himself."" (Simon Winchester, author of ""The Professor and the Madman,"" for ""The New York Times Book Review"")  ""With this compelling study, Bobrick has written an intricate and delightful prelude to any effective understanding of the evolution of modern Western democracy."" (Michael Pakenham, ""The Baltimore Sun"")  ""[""Wide as the Waters""] . . . has the satisfying concreteness of a good novel. . . .

Meski Islam menyebar terutama melalui perang, kaum Muslim mencapai prestasi budaya amat besar—hingga berabad-abad berikutnya, peradaban Arab-Muslim memberi dampak “abadi” terhadap Barat dalam astronomi, geometri, aljabar, obat-obatan, kimia, dan ilmu pengetahuan lainnya. Dari teknik, fashion, hingga persenjataan, pengaruh Arab-Muslim membentuk dunia Barat, begitu pula bidang hukum, musik, dan sastra.Dalam buku memikat ini, Benson Bobrick menceritakan kenaikan Harun ar-Rasyid ke tampuk kekuasaan, juga keagungan dan pengaruhnya yang luas. Perseteruan berabad-abad antara bangsa Arab dan Byzantium pun tak luput dari penuturan. Bahkan, melemah hingga jatuhnya kekhalifahan Baghdad akibat friksi internal keluarga istana terkisahkan pula secara dramatis. Dan, buku ini begitu terang merekam zaman keemasan Islam beserta kontribusi permanennya bagi peradaban yang terus terasa sampai kini.",,,08/14/12,March 2013,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Islam', 'Religion']",,9781416567622,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390799990l/20640618.jpg,3.63,[],97.0,1.0,,20640618-kejayaan-sang-khalifah-harun-ar-rasyid,,,,,93.0,145.0,416,,Pustaka Alvabet,"['26', '53', '56', '7', '3']",,,[],,
"Benson Deng, Alephonsion Deng, Benjamin Ajak, Judy A. Bernstein (Goodreads Author)",They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky: The True Story of Three Lost Boys from Sudan,,English,,"Benjamin, Alepho, and Benson were raised among the Dinka tribe of Sudan. Their world was an insulated, close-knit community of grass-roofed cottages, cattle herders, and tribal councils. The lions and pythons that prowled beyond the village fences were the greatest threat they knew. All that changed the night the government-armed Murahiliin began attacking their villages.Amid the chaos, screams, conflagration, and gunfire, 5-year-old Benson and 7-year-old Benjamin fled into the dark night. Two years later, Alepho, age 7, was forced to do the same. Across the Southern Sudan, over the next 5 years, thousands of other boys did likewise, joining this stream of child refugees that became known as the Lost Boys. Their journey would take them more than 1000 miles across a war-ravaged country, through landmine-sown paths, crocodile-infested waters, and grotesque extremes of hunger, thirst, and disease. The refugee camps they eventually filtered through offered little respite from the brutality they were fleeing.In They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky, Alepho, Benson, and Benjamin, by turn, recount their experiences along this unthinkable journey. They vividly recall the family, friends, and tribal world they left far behind them and their desperate efforts to keep track of one another. This is a captivating memoir of Sudan and a powerful portrait of war as seen through the eyes of children. And it is, in the end, an inspiring and unforgettable tribute to the tenacity of even the youngest human spirits.",,,06/01/05,June 13th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Memoir', 'History', 'War', 'Sudan', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'School', 'Autobiography']",,9781586483883,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348070572l/143819.jpg,4.18,[],88.0,1.0,,143819.They_Poured_Fire_on_Us_from_the_Sky,,,,,96.0,8677.0,334,,PublicAffairs,"['3806', '3134', '1372', '255', '110']",,,"['Juol (Sudan)', 'South Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'Natinga (South Sudan)', 'Kenya']",,
Benson John Lossing,Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence,,English,,"While most children grasp the importance of America's Declaration of Independence, few experience the lives of its multifarious signatories. Few read of the trials & tribulations of those who risked their ""lives, fortunes & sacred honor"" for the liberty we dearly cherish. LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, originally published in 1848, provides a brief biography of each of these men. These biographies, accompanied by fifty engravings, illuminate ""the chief events in the lives of the men who stood sponsors at the baptism of blood of our infant republic."" Children will rediscover the private & public virtues of America's most venerated fathers; they will relive the creation of the most stable & enviable nation in the world.

Beppe Fenoglio,The Twenty-Three Days of the City of Alba: Stories,,English,,"TWO THOUSAND ITALIAN partisans took the city of Alba on October 10, 1944, and two hundred lost it to the Fascists on November 2. Among the bedraggled fighters in this historic siege was Beppe Fenoglio. He later made his debut as a writer with this collection of short stories based on his experiences in the Italian resistance movement.The year 2002 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the collection's original publication in Italy and its first appearance in English. Fenoglio's spare, direct prose still strikes with the staccato-like force of rifle fire. He creates an intimate, unvarnished portrait of his fellow partisans: an ill-equipped, malnourished mix of trained soldiers, eager farmboys, and broken old men. Antiheroes, they all but bumbled their way into playing a crucial role in the Allied victory of World War II, then returned home to nurse their wounds.Fenoglio's cast includes the drunken thief Blister, who opens fire inside a house for a glass of grappa; Hector, a partisan commander who becomes an unemployed mama's boy following the war; and Raul, an intellectual like Fenoglio, who joins the partisans out of ideological commitment, only to find scant room on the battlefield for ideology.",,,1952,April 12th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Italian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'War', 'Italy', 'Literature', 'Historical Romance']",,9781586420406,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172582855l/193127._SY475_.jpg,3.81,[],44.0,1.0,,193127.The_Twenty_Three_Days_of_the_City_of_Alba,,,,,94.0,401.0,176,,Steerforth,"['88', '179', '109', '21', '4']",,,[],,

Bernard Coat L.,Les caprices d'Anaïs,,French,,"Après être resté en apnée pendant mon adolescence, dans les Univers d’Edgar Alan Poe ou de Stephen King et, bien plus tard, dans les textes de Thomas Harris, j’ai découvert un beau jour la littérature noire de Maurice G.Dantec. J’ai pensé à cet instant-là, que plus rien n’y aucun autre auteur ne pourrait me procurer un tel vertige de lecture. Et puis, il y a les auteurs comme Bernard Coat que l’on rencontre un jour, que l’on découvre, que l’on lit.La plume de Bernard Coat est de celles qui me parlent, que je ressens, que j’affectionne car elles impriment en moi, au fil de leurs lectures, des images, des travellings, des plans-séquences. Cela, peut-être, est-il dû au fait que l’auteur soit avant tout un scénariste de talent, avec pour références de nombreuses collaborations pour de prestigieuses institutions, le cinéma ou bien encore des émissions de variétés télévisées. Son écriture reste aérienne, transparente, parfois très sombre. On retrouve aussi dans les dialogues de ses récits de vraies perles métaphoriques, on y sent aussi bien la patte d’Audiard que celle de Balzac.La narration de Bernard Coat est atypique, parfois hypnotique. Tantôt simple, tantôt utile, parfois « rentre-dedans ». La richesse du vocabulaire de Bernard Coat vaut son pesant d’or et donne ses lettres de noblesse à son roman intitulé « Du sang sur les docks » ; un illustre roman noir, social, intriguant. Cet ouvrage semble être un étrange hybride cinémato-littéraire, issu de l’accouplement de « Fight club » de David Fincher, et de « Usual suspect » de Bryan Singer.La faune éditoriale à encore beaucoup de chemin à parcourir, beaucoup de chasseurs de têtes à recruter. Existe-t-il encore beaucoup d’individus tels que Bernard Coat ? Y-a-t-il encore beaucoup d’auteurs de cette trempe, noyés dans la masse, laissés dans l’ombre, des auteurs qui possèdent de vraies pépites dans leurs tiroirs, de vrais langages et de vraies dentelles littéraires dans leurs crânes ? La réponse est oui, et Bernard COAT en est la parfaite émergence. Il représente, à mon sens, un vrai talent ; la prouesse d’une plume excellente comme il me plaît d’en lire, d’en découvrir et d’en parler. Vous découvrirez au fil de ce roman comment, de manière surprenante, le style narratif de l’auteur vous emmaillotera comme l’arachnide le fait avec ses proies.

Non, le talent ne se trouve pas forcément sous les feux de la rampe, à la radio ou sur un plateau télé. A la lecture du Roman noir d’Anaïs, j’ai plongé dans la grâce, la subtilité.

Bernard Cornwell (Goodreads Author),Agincourt,,English,,"Agincourt is one of the epic battles of history. It was fought by two badly matched armies that met in atrocious conditions on St Crispin's Day 1415, and resulted in an extraordinary victory that was celebrated in England long before Shakespeare immortalised it in Henry V. It has always been held to be the triumph of the longbow against the armoured knight, and of the common man against the feudal aristocrat, but those are history's myths. Bernard Cornwell, who has long wanted to write this story, depicts the reality behind the myths.Nicholas Hook is an English archer. He seems born to trouble and, when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising, Nick's headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel, part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe, and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille, a leader of Henry V's army. The army was superb, but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur, reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and, in appalling weather, leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.Azincourt culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side, but also from the French ranks, the scene is vivid, convincing and compelling.

As the ninth century wanes, England appears about to be plunged into chaos once more. For the Viking-raised but Saxon-born warrior, Uhtred, whose life seems to shadow the making of England, this presents him with difficult choices. King Alfred is dying and his passing threatens the island of Britain to renewed warfare. Alfred wants his son, Edward, to succeed him but there are other Saxon claimants to the throne as well as ambitious pagan Vikings to the north.

His own desire is to reclaim his long lost lands and castle to the north.

As the killers sail away, Thomas vows to avenge the murder of his townspeople and to recapture a holy treasure that the black knight stole from the church.To do this, Thomas of Hookton must first make his way to France; So in 1343 he joins the army of King Edward III as it is about to invade the continent -- the beginning of the Hundred Years War. A preternaturally gifted bowman, Thomas quickly becomes recognized as one of England's most deadly archers in King Edward's march across France. Yet he never stops scanning the horizon for his true enemy's flag.When Thomas saves a young Frenchwoman from a bloodthirsty crowd, her father -- French nobleman Sir Guillaume d'Evecque -- rewards his bravery by joining him in the hunt for the mysterious dark knight and the stolen holy relic. What begins as a search for vengeance will soon prove the beginning of an even higher purpose: the quest for the Holy Grail itself.",Grail Quest #1,,10/16/00,November 8th 2005,"['Edward, the Black Prince', 'Edward III of England', 'Thomas of Hookton']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'War', 'Adventure', 'British Literature', 'Audiobook', '14th Century']",,9780060935764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407709312l/68531.jpg,4.13,[],782.0,11.0,,68531.The_Archer_s_Tale,,,,,96.0,25822.0,400,,Harper Perennial,"['9997', '10388', '4443', '765', '229']",,,[],,

Bernard Cornwell (Goodreads Author),Stonehenge,,English,,"Four thousand years ago, a stranger's death at the Old Temple of Ratharryn-and his ominous ""gift"" of gold-precipitates the building of what for centuries to come will be known as one of mankind's most singular and remarkable achievements. Bernard Cornwell's epic novel Stonehenge catapults us into a powerful and vibrant world of ritual and sacrifice at once timeless and wholly original-a tale of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry: and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.Three brothers-deadly rivals-are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. There is Lengar, the eldest, a ruthless warrior intent on replacing his father as chief of the tribe of Ratharryn; Camaban, his bastard brother, a sorcerer whose religious fervor inspires the plan for Stonehenge; and Saban, the youngest, through whose expertise the temple will finally be completed. Divided by blood but united-precariously-by a shared vision, the brothers begin erecting their mighty ring of granite, aligning towering stones to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and raising arches to appease and unite their gods. Caught between the zealousness of his ambitious brothers, Saban becomes the true leader of his people, a peacemaker who will live to see the temple built in the name of salvation and regeneration.Bernard Cornwell, long admired for his rousing narrative and meticulous historical imaginings, has here delivered his masterpiece, the most compelling and powerful human drama of its kind since Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and Edward Rutherford's Sarum. His re-creation of civilization as it might have been in 2000 B.C. at once amplifies the mystery of his subject and makes the world of Stonehenge come alive as never before.",,,10/04/99,December 14th 2004,"['Lengar', 'Camaban', 'Saban']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'British Literature', 'Adventure', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Prehistoric', 'Prehistory', 'Romance']",,9780060956851,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1276681573l/101086.jpg,3.65,[],459.0,6.0,,101086.Stonehenge,,,,,88.0,10199.0,578,,Harper Perennial,"['2320', '3494', '3144', '992', '249']",,,['Britain'],,

Christian Europe was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed. The West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and then in the marketplace. In this elegantly written volume, Bernard Lewis, a renowned authority an Islamic affairs, examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to make sense of how it had been overtaken, overshadowed, and dominated by the West. In a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil, Lewis shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry, industry, government, education, and culture. He also describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, while others asked not ""Who did this to us?"" but rather ""Where did we go wrong?""

The Clash Between Islam & Modernity in the Middle East,,English,,"For centuries, the world of Islam was in the forefront of human achievement -- the foremost military and economic power in the world, the leader in the arts and sciences of civilization. Christian Europe was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed. The West won victory after victory, first on the battlefield and then in the marketplace.In this elegantly written volume, Bernard Lewis, a renowned authority an Islamic affairs, examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to make sense of how it had been overtaken, overshadowed, and dominated by the West. In a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil, Lewis shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry, industry, government, education, and culture. He also describes how some Middle Easterners fastened blame on a series of scapegoats, while others asked not ""Who did this to us?"" but rather ""Where did we go wrong?""With a new Afterword that addresses September 11 and its aftermath, What Went Wrong? is an urgent, accessible book that no one who is concerned with contemporary affairs will want to miss.",,,2001,January 7th 2003,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Islam', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'World History', 'Sociology', 'The World', 'Historical', 'War']",,9780060516055,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407707585l/27577.jpg,3.51,[],39.0,1.0,,27577.What_Went_Wrong_The_Clash_Between_Islam_Modernity_in_the_Middle_East,,,,,85.0,3093.0,186,,Harper Perennial,"['551', '1092', '983', '307', '160']",,,[],,

Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: ""Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives.

Bernard Werber,Empire of the Ants,,English,,"Here is the stunning international bestseller in the tradition of Watership Down but with a dark, original twist. Unique, daring, and unforgettable, it tells the story of an ordinary family who accidentally threaten the security of a hidden civilization as intelligent as our own--a colony of ants determined to survive at any cost....Jonathan Wells and his young family have come to the Paris flat at 3, rue des Sybarites through the bequest of his eccentric late uncle Edmond. Inheriting the dusty apartment, the Wells family are left with only one warning: Never go down into the cellar.But when the family dog disappears down the basement steps, Jonathan follows--and soon his wife, his son, and various would-be rescuers vanish into its mysterious depths.Meanwhile, in a pine stump in a nearby park, a vast civilization is in turmoil. Here a young female from the russet ant nation of Bel-o-kan learns that a strange new weapon has been killing off her comrades. To find out why, she enlists the help of a warrior ant, and the two set off on separate journeys into a harsh and violent world. It is a world where death takes many forms--savage birds and voracious lizards, warlike dwarf ants and rapacious termites, poisonous beetles and, most bizarre of all, the swift, murderous, giant guardians of the edge of the world: cars.Yet the end of the female's desperate quest will be the eerie secret in the cellar at 3, rue des Sybarites--a mystery she must solve in order to fulfill her special destiny as the new queen of her own great empire. But to do so she must first make unthinkable communion with the most barbaric creatures of all. Empire of the Ants is a brilliant evocation of a hidden civilization as complex as our own and far more ancient. It is a fascinating realm where boats are built of leaves and greenflies are domesticated and milked like cows, where citizens lock antennae in ""absolute communication"" and fight wars with precisely coordinated armies using sprays of glue and acids that can dissolve a snail.

Bernard Williams,Moral Luck,Philosophical Papers 1973-1980,,Philosophy,"A new volume of philosophical essays by Bernard Williams. The book is a successor to Problems of the Self, but whereas that volume dealt mainly with questions of personal identity, Moral Luck centres on questions of moral philosophy and the theory of rational action. That whole area has of course been strikingly reinvigorated over the last deacde, and philosophers have both broadened and deepened their concerns in a way that now makes much earlier moral and political philosophy look sterile and trivial. Moral Luck contains a number of essays that have contributed influentially to this development. Among the recurring themes are the moral and philosophical limitations of utilitarianism, the notion of integrity, relativism, and problems of moral conflict and rational choice. The work presented here is marked by a high degree of imagination and acuity, and also conveys a strong sense of psychological reality.

Bernd Heinrich,Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds,,English,,"In Mind of the Raven, Bernd Heinrich, award - winning naturalist, finds himself dreaming of ravens and decides he must get to the truth about this animal reputed to be so intelligent.Much like a sleuth, Heinrich involves us in his quest, letting one clue lead to the next. But as animals can only be spied on by getting quite close Heinrich adopts ravens, thereby becoming a ""raven father,"" as well as observing them in their natural habitat, studying their daily routines, and in the process painting a vivid picture of the world as lived by the ravens. At the heart of this book are Heinrich's love and respect for these complex and engaging creatures, and through his keen observation andanalysis, we become their intimates too.Throughout history there has existed an extraordinary relationship between humans and ravens. Ravens, like early humans, are scavengers on the kills of great carnivores. As scavengers, ravens were associated with hunters they found in the north: wolves and, later, men. The trinity of wolf, man, and raven in the hunt is an extremely ancient one. In considering the appeal of the raven, Bernd Heinrich suspects that a meeting of the minds might reside in that hunting trinity.Heinrich's passion for ravens has led him around the world in his research. Mind of the Raven takes you on an exotic journey--from New England to Germany, Montana to Baffin Island in the high Arctic--offering dazzling accounts of how science works in the field, filtered through the eyes of a passionate observer of nature.Heinrich has a true gift; through his stories, his beautiful writing, illustrations, and photography, the ravens come alive. Each new discovery and insight into their behavior is thrilling to read. just as the title promises, the reader is given a rare glimpse into the mind of these wonderful creatures.Following the dictum of Leonardo da Vinci--""It is not enough to believe what you see. YOU Must also understand what you see""--Bernd Heinrich enables us to see the natural world through the eyes of a scientist. At once lyrical and scientific, Mind of the Raven is bound to be a modern classic.",,,10/30/94,April 5th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Birds', 'Natural History', 'Biology', 'Ornithology', 'Audiobook', 'Science Nature']",,9780060930639,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1173183652l/254704.jpg,4.04,['John Burroughs Medal (2000)'],96.0,2.0,,254704.Mind_of_the_Raven,,,,,94.0,3029.0,380,,Ecco Press,"['1104', '1149', '595', '142', '39']",,,[],,
Bernhard Bueb,Lob der Disziplin. Eine Streitschrift,,German,,"Disziplin, so hat die Erfahrung den langjährigen Schulleiter des Internats Salem, Bernhard Bueb, gelehrt, ist das Tor zum Glück. Sie, so seine These, bildet das Rückgrat einer jeden guten, das heißt: gelingenden Erziehung. Erst durch sie und mit ihr der Fähigkeit, Autorität (und Autoritäten) anzuerkennen, auf die unmittelbare Befriedigung eines jeden Bedürfnisses zu verzichten und Verantwortung zu übernehmen, werden junge Menschen in die Lage versetzt, ein tatsächlich selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen -- was ja unbestritten eines der vorrangigen Ziele von Erziehung darstellt. Seiner Streitschrift, die dem überkommenen Laisser-faire-Leitbild der 68-erPädagogen das Scheitern attestiert, hat der Autor einen Fontane-Vers vorangestellt, der den Kern seines Erziehungskonzepts auf den Punkt bringt: Freiheit freilich. Aber zum Schlimmen. / Führt der Masse sich selbst Bestimmen. / Und das Klügste, das Beste, Bequemste / Das auch freien Seelen weitaus Genehmste / Heißt doch schließlich, ich hab's nicht Hehl: / Festes Gesetz und fester Befehl! Manches Elternohr wird bei solchen Worten erröten. Und dies aus guten Gründen. Das weiß natürlich auch Bernhard Bueb, der auch um die Ursache für solcherlei Unbehagen nur zu genau weiß: Zutiefst erschüttert wurde die pädagogische Kultur in Deutschland durch den Nationalsozialismus, der im Anschluss an den Kadavergehorsam der kaiserlichen Kadettenanstalten Begriffe wie Disziplin und Autorität in der pädagogischen Praxis vollends pervertierte. Die 68-er-Pädagogik war der Pendelschlag in die Richtung des anderen Extrems, der scheinbar völligen Beliebigkeit. Gegen diese Beliebigkeit zieht Bueb bei aller Irritation, die seine provokant klingenden Thesen bei vielen Lesern hervorrufen wird, mit guten Gründen zu Felde. Wir wünschen dem Autor jedenfalls, dass sein Lob der Disziplin eine heftige Debatte auslöst. Schließlich ist das der Sinn einer jeden Streitschrift.

Bernhard Hennen,Die Ordensburg,,German,," Bernhard Hennen ist Fantasy-Lesern längst ein Begriff -- mit der erfolgreichen Elfen-Trilogie hat er sich einen Ruf als erzählmächtiger deutscher Fantasy-Autor geschaffen. In Die Ordensburg, dem ersten Band seiner neuen Trilogie, kehrt Hennen in die beliebte Welt der Elfen zurück und erzählt die Geschichte des Fjordlandes.  Das Fjordland wird von den Ordensrittern bedroht. Unter der Führung der Ritterin Lilianne de Droy und dem Priester Pater Charles rückt das Heer der Tjuredkirche immer weiter vor, um die letzten Enklaven heidnischer Religion zu vernichten. Nach einem erbitterten Kampf haben sie bereits den Südwesten des Landes Drusna erobert, doch die an das Fjordland angrenzenden Fürstentümer leisten weiterhin Widerstand. Der König des Fjordlands, Gunnar Eichenarm, sammelt seine Verbündeten um sich -- die letzten freien Bojaren Drusnas und die Elfen --, um den Ordensrittern entgegenzutreten.  Nach dem tragischen Tod ihres jüngeren Bruders ist das Mädchen Gishild nun das einzige Kind von König Gunnar und soll einmal als Kriegerkönigin die Geschicke des Fjordlandes lenken. Von Elfen ausgebildet, hat sich Gishild bereits in jungen Jahren mit dieser großen Verantwortung abgefunden. Kurz darauf wird sie jedoch von den Ordensrittern entführt, die auf diese Weise ihren Vater zur Kapitulation zwingen wollen. In der Gefangenschaft lernt Gishild den jungen Luc kennen, einen Waisenjungen, der auf der Ordensburg von Valloncour zum Ritter ausgebildet werden soll, und beide fühlen sich schon bald zueinander hingezogen.  Hennen ist ein Meister der atmosphärischen Schilderungen. Seine Elfen sind ätherische und geheimnisvolle Wesen, die im Hintergrund die Geschicke der Menschen lenken. Zugleich erzählt die Trilogie auch die Geschichte einer Welt in Aufruhr -- die Religion der Tjuredkirche droht die alten Völker und damit auch die Elfen zu verdrängen. Ein interessanter Konflikt, gepaart mit lebensecht wirkenden Figuren -- das war das Geheimnis des Erfolges von Hennens erster Elfen-Trilogie. In Die Ordensburg gelingt es ihm, an dieses Erfolgsrezept anzuschließen und den Leser wie gewohnt von der ersten Seite an in seinen Bann zu ziehen. -- Großartige Unterhaltung mit dem beliebtesten aller Fantasy-Völker! -- Gerhard Schildmann",Elfenritter #1,,,2007,[],Broschiert,"['Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy']",,9783453523333,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327354719l/2952803.jpg,4.11,[],100.0,1.0,,2952803-die-ordensburg,,,,,96.0,931.0,638,,Heyne,"['370', '336', '187', '31', '7']",,,[],,

Over sweet-potato pie, an unlikely friendship begins, transforming both women's lives--and the life of an entire town.Sugar brings a Southern African-American town vividly to life, with its flowering magnolia trees, lingering scents of jasmine and honeysuckle, and white picket fences that keep strangers out--but ignorance and superstition in. To read this novel is to take a journey through loss and suffering to a place of forgiveness, understanding, and grace.  McFadden is the author of the novels Gathering of Waters, Glorious, and This Bitter Earth. ",Sugar Lacey #1,,02/01/00,January 2nd 2001,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'African American', 'Historical', 'Southern', 'African American Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels']",,9780452282209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388182590l/495369.jpg,4.3,[],99.0,1.0,,495369.Sugar,,,,,97.0,5824.0,240,,Plume,"['2913', '1959', '787', '128', '37']",,,[],,
Bernice Morgan,Random Passage,,English,,"Forced to flee England, the Andrews family books passage to a fresh start in a distant country, only to discover a barren, inhospitable land at the end of their crossing. To seventeen-year-old Lavinia, uprooted from everything familiar, it seems a fate worse than the one they left behind. Driven by loneliness she begins a journal. Random Passage satisfies the craving for those details that headstones and history books can never give: the real story of our Newfoundland ancestors, of how time and chance brought them to the forbidding shores of a new found land. It is a saga of families and of individuals; of acquisitive Mary Bundle; of charming Ned Andrews, whose thievery has turned his family into exiles; of mad Ida; of Thomas Hutchings, who might be an aristocrat, a holy man, or a murderer; and of Lavinia - who wrote down the truth and lies about them all.

"Bert Hölldobler, Edward O. Wilson",Journey to the Ants: A Story of Scientific Exploration,,English,,"Hailed as ""a masterpiece"" by Scientific American and as ""the greatest of all entomology books"" by Science, Bert Holldobler and Edward O. Wilson's monumental treatise The Ants also was praised in the popular press and won a Pulitzer Prize. This overwhelming success attests to a fact long known and deeply felt by the authors: the infinite fascination of their tiny subjects. This fascination finds its full expression in Journey to the Ants, an overview of myrmecology that is also an eloquent tale of the authors' pursuit of these astonishing insects.Richly illustrated and delightfully written, Journey to the Ants combines autobiography and scientific lore to convey the excitement and pleasure the study of ants can offer. The authors interweave their personal adventures with the social lives of ants, building, from the first minute observations of childhood, a remarkable account of these abundant insects' evolutionary achievement. Accompanying Holldobler and Wilson, we peer into the colony to see how ants cooperate and make war, how they reproduce and bury their dead, how they use propaganda and surveillance, and how they exhibit a startlingly familiar ambivalence between allegiance and self-aggrandizement. This exotic tour of the entire range of formicid biodiversity - from social parasites to army ants, nomadic hunters, camouflaged huntresses, and energetic builders of temperature-controlled skyscrapers - opens out increasingly into natural history, intimating the relevance of ant life to human existence. A window on the world of ants as well as those who study them, this book will be a rich source of knowledge and pleasure for anyone who has ever stopped to wonder about the miniature yet immense civilization at our feet.",,,,August 5th 1994,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Nature', 'Natural History', 'Animals', 'Evolution', 'Business', 'Science Nature', 'Environment']",,9780674485259,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348321088l/1214499.jpg,4.4,['Prismas Casa de las Ciencias a la Divulgación for Libro editado (1997)'],72.0,1.0,,1214499.Journey_to_the_Ants,,,,,98.0,546.0,228,,Belknap Press,"['292', '195', '50', '6', '3']",,,[],,

Battered by hardships, brutality, and the degradation and death of her children, she ultimately finds herself alone with the one thing in which she truly believes -- her ramshackle wagon with its tattered flag and freight of boots and brandy. Fitting herself in its harness, the old woman manages, with the last of her strength, to drag it onward to the next battle.

Bertrand Russell,Has Man a Future?,,English,,"What spurs a famous philosopher, at the age of 89, to plunge into a political campaign of civil disobedience and go to prison for his beliefs? The answer is an urgent concern for the continuance of the human race.In the million years during which man has lived on this planet, he must have survived many hazards. Can he hope to survive a nuclear war? Here lies the most agonizing question of our era.Refuting the theory that scientists have been the willing tools of governments, Russell exposes the hypocrisy of official attitudes to nuclear weapons. The one hope for man, he proclaims, is to be found in world government. He maps out a reasoned scheme in his this book, and details the practical steps we can take towards it today.This moving pronouncement - in its admiration of man's past achievements, in the despair engendered by his present plight, in its unquenchable concern for those who follow - is no less than Russell's living testament to mankind.",,,,1961,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Politics', 'Classics', '20th Century']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542826964l/2258680._SX318_.jpg,3.65,[],55.0,1.0,,2258680.Has_Man_a_Future_,,,,,90.0,181.0,128,,,"['37', '65', '61', '15', '3']",,,[],,

"Bertrand Russell, Paul Edwards (Editor)",Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects,,English,,"Dedicated as few men have been to the life of reason, Bertrand Russell has always been concerned with the basic questions to which religion also addresses itself -- questions about man's place in the universe and the nature of the good life, questions that involve life after death, morality, freedom, education, and sexual ethics. He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire.  ""I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,"" Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954.  The book has been edited, with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix, Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial ""Bertrand Russell Case"" of 1940, in which Russell was judicially declared ""unfit"" to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York.  Whether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand Russell's views, he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions, a masterly statement of a philosophical position, and a pure joy to read.",,,05/28/57,October 30th 1967,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Atheism', 'Essays', 'Classics', 'Science', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Spirituality']",,9780671203238,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347925703l/472025.jpg,4.02,[],556.0,7.0,,472025.Why_I_Am_Not_a_Christian_and_Other_Essays_on_Religion_and_Related_Subjects,,,,,92.0,18449.0,266,,Touchstone,"['6906', '6845', '3312', '916', '470']",,,[],,

Bessel A. van der Kolk,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma",,English,,"A pioneering researcher and one of the world’s foremost experts on traumatic stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing. Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds, emotions, and even on biology. Sadly, trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to their partners and children. Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain’s wiring—specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies.

  Beautiful, seventeen-year-old Violet lives in a perfect world. Everybody loves her.

  In 2012, she's still beautiful, charming, and surrounded by admirers.
 Veronica ""Ronni"" Johnson, licensed practical nurse and aspiring writer, meets the captivating Violet in the assisted living facility where Violet requires no assistance, just lots of male attention. When she dies, she leaves Ronni a very generous bequest―only if Ronni completes a book about her life within one year. As she's drawn into the world of young Violet, Ronni is mesmerized by life in a simpler time. It's an irresistible journey filled with revelations, some of them about men Ronni knew as octogenarians at Fairfield Springs. Struggling, insecure, flailing at the keyboard, Ronni juggles her patients, a new boyfriend, and a Samsonite factory of emotional baggage as she tries to craft a manuscript before her deadline.But then the secrets start to emerge, some of them in person. And they don't stop.Everything changes.

From that moment on, her life is forever changed. She gets a new name, a new identity and a new life in the midst of the gang’s base on the edge of the Florida Everglades—a frightening, rough and violent world much like the swamps themselves, where everyone has an alias and loyalty is tantamount to survival.

It’s not like they were close. She hadn’t seen him — or her grandmother, the ice queen — in almost twenty years. But when Adella Atwater, the manager of her grandmother’s apartment house, called and said her expenses would be paid if she’d fly in for the burial, a free trip to New Orleans was too intriguing to resist. What Adella didn’t tell her was that the apartment house wasn’t a house at all — and that whatever it was, it bore the dead weight of a long and painful history. As soon as Jillian meets the odd assortment of renters and realizes that her grandmother had no idea she was coming, she hatches a plan to escape. But the investigation into her father’s death quickly unfolds and Jillian is drawn into the lives of the colorful collection of saints and sinners who pass through Saint Silvanus. She soon discovers there is more at stake than she ever imagined. Who is behind the baffling messages and the strange relics left on the steps? Is it possible that her family is actually cursed? Or is it just this crazy old house that holds them all under its spell?

Soon, Nikki learns that the powder and lipstick are simply cover-up for the Carrie Mae Foundation: a secret organization of international espionage and high-tech mascara founded for the purpose of “helping women everywhere.” Whisked off to Thailand with the legendary Carrie Mae agent Val Robinson, Nikki is soon in over her head. Between investigating the abduction of a human rights activist, tracking down a murderous arms dealer, keeping up with her wildly dangerous new partner, and occasionally trying to date a hunk who may or may not be CIA, Nikki has to use all the courage and cosmetic technology she’s got to bring down the bad guys and get out alive. With the support of the colorful Carrie Mae crew, Nikki will overcome even the most harrowing obstacles—including incessant phone calls from her mother—or die trying.",Nikki Lanier #1,,02/04/10,March 2nd 2010,[],Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Humor', 'Espionage', 'Action', 'Romance', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780743292771,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404632123l/6773641.jpg,3.58,[],84.0,1.0,,6773641-bulletproof-mascara,,,,,86.0,367.0,400,,Atria Books,"['72', '133', '110', '39', '13']",,,[],,

The first books in the Russian Guns series (The Arrangement, followed by The Life) should be read first*In the mess of love and life, nothing and no one is left untouched. After everything the Russian mob boss Anton Avdonin has done to keep his family safe from the dangers of the world surrounding them, he never thought it would come down to this. The officials are knocking, the charges are piling, his wife is hurting, and they’re facing a fate he never thought to consider. He didn’t just make one mistake … no, he made many. It’s time to answer for them all. Viviana “Vine” Avdonin is stuck watching the life she adores crumble around her. Bad decisions have led to terrible consequences in more ways than one. She doesn’t have time to recover from one devastating tragedy that leaves her shattered before the next one is crushing down, too. Saving her husband from a life sentence might be the easiest thing she has to do when her own misdeeds are staring her in the face.Together, Anton and Viviana have survived more than once, but this path will be by far, the hardest they’ve ever walked. Sometimes they have to walk it alone … because forgiveness isn’t always black and white and love can be blurred by pain. With the blissful ignorance gone and the blinders removed, how much of themselves will they have to sacrifice to come out on top one last time?When everyone has a score to settle, it’s hard to notice the person causing the most heartache is the one staring back in the mirror.

Old rivals from the past and bad blood from the present have mixed in the worst way, threatening to take away the things Viviana loves the very most. No matter what, she can’t let that happen. Both Viviana and Anton know there’s only one way this can all end and it’s up to them to do it. But, who is behind the veiled threats and personal attacks, and how far are they willing to go to get what they want? When the truth finally surfaces, the consequences will be devastating and no one could have seen it coming.

The deal between leading mafia families has more on the line than anyone knew, even if the Bratva and Cosa Nostra shouldn’t mix. When Vine’s family is murdered and she’s left with nothing more than her grief to survive the mob world alone, she believes the arrangement won’t see the light of day. Anton can’t allow the one woman he was supposed to love get away. At the possibility of her death, he steps in to save her with guns blazing, knowing exactly what it might cost him: everything. But it’s been nearly a decade since their last meeting, and he can’t help but wonder if the woman he took back is the same girl he fell for all those years before. Protected and loved, Vine is unable to forget their shared moments a lifetime ago, or the future she knows they’re owed. When an old flame of Anton’s shows up to rip the veil off the carefully constructed secrets he’d been hiding, she learns that nothing about her life is as it seems. But, that’s nothing compared to the bomb about to blow. Can Vine see beyond the pain and blood to take what she always wanted?

Betty Jay,E.M. Forster - A Passage to India,,,Language Arts & Disciplines,"A Passage to India (1924), the last of E. M. Forster's novels to be published in his lifetime, became an immediate bestseller and also met with critical acclaim for its moral and political commentary on the crossings between individuals and cultures in the India of the British Empire. Forster's record of the terrible consequences of failed connection, of the unexpected upheavals that unsettle the calm of middle-class life, and of the challenges to the ideological foundations of Empire draw their strength from the novel's blend of intense realism and complex narrative technique. In this Readers' Guide, Betty Jay considers the establishment of Forster's reputation and the various attempts of critics to decipher the complex codes that are a feature of his novel. Successive chapters focus on debates around Forster's liberal-humanism, with essays from F. R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling and Malcolm Bradbury; on the indeterminacy and ambiguity of the text, with extracts from essays by Gillian Beer, Robert Barratt, Wendy Moffat and Jo-Ann Hoeppner Moran; and on the sexual politics of Forster's work, with writings from Elaine Showalter, Frances L.

Beverly Butler,Light a Single Candle,,,,"When Cathy lost her sight at the age of 14, she faced a very different way of life, where her other senses had to take over the work of her eyes. Adjusting to blindness was often easier than handling the reactions of people. One friend who now avoided her her. Another smothered her with too much kindness. Then came the thrill of independence after completing a tough training course with Trudy, her wonderful new guide dog. With her new freedom of movement, Cathy accepted the challenge of going back to public high school.

Beverly Daniel Tatum,Can We Talk about Race?: And Other Conversations in an Era of School Resegregation,,English,,"Beverly Daniel Tatum emerged on the national scene in 1997 with ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?,"" a book that spoke to a wide audience about the psychological dynamics of race relations in America. Tatum's unique ability to get people talking about race captured the attention of many, from Oprah Winfrey to President Clinton, who invited her to join him in his nationally televised dialogues on race.In her first book since that pathbreaking success, Tatum starts with a warning call about the increasing but underreported resegregation of America. A self-described ""integration baby""--she was born in 1954--Tatum sees our growing isolation from each other as deeply problematic, and she believes that schools can be key institutions for forging connections across the racial divide.In this ambitious, accessible book, Tatum examines some of the most resonant issues in American education and race relations: -The need of African American students to see themselves reflected in curricula and institutions-How unexamined racial attitudes can negatively affect minority-student achievement-The possibilities--and complications--of intimate crossracial friendshipsTatum approaches all these topics with the blend of analysis and storytelling that make her one of our most persuasive and engaging commentators on race.Can We Talk About Race? launches a collaborative lecture and book series between Beacon Press and Simmons College, which aims to reinvigorate a crucial national public conversation on race, education and democracy.""What Tatum seeks to do above all is trigger sometimes challenging discussions about race, and infuse those discussions with a reality-based focus on how race affects us all. Her latest book does that beautifully, asking touch questions, and patiently, inclusively seeking answers."" --Boston Globe Beverly Daniel Tatum is author of Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? and Assimilation Blues.

Bhikkhu Bodhi (Translator),The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya,,English,,"This volume offers a complete translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, the third of the four great collections in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. The Samyutta Nikaya consists of fifty-six chapters, each governed by a unifying theme that binds together the Buddha's suttas or discourses. The chapters are organized into five major parts.The first, The Book with Verses, is a compilation of suttas composed largely in verse. This book ranks as one of the most inspiring compilations in the Buddhist canon, showing the Buddha in his full grandeur as the peerless ""teacher of gods and humans."" The other four books deal in depth with the philosophical principles and meditative structures of early Buddhism. They combine into orderly chapters all the important short discourses of the Buddha on such major topics as dependent origination, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Four Noble Truths.Among the four large Nikayas belonging to the Pali Canon, the Samyutta Nikaya serves as the repository for the many shorter suttas of the Buddha where he discloses his radical insights into the nature of reality and his unique path to spiritual emancipation. This collection, it seems, was directed mainly at those disciples who were capable of grasping the deepest dimensions of wisdom and of clarifying them for others, and also provided guidance to meditators intent on consummating their efforts with the direct realization of the ultimate truth. The present work begins with an insightful general introduction to the Samyutta Nikaya as a whole. Each of the five parts is also provided with its own introduction, intended to guide the reader through this vast, ocean-like collection of suttas. To further assist the reader, the translator has provided an extensive body of notes clarifying various problems concerning both the language and the meaning of the texts. Distinguished by its lucidity and technical precision, this new translation makes this ancient collection of the Buddha's discourses accessible and comprehensible to the thoughtful reader of today. Like its two predecessors in this series, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha is sure to merit a place of honour in the library of every serious student of Buddhism.",,,06/30/00,June 15th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Buddhism', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality']",,9780861713318,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390767363l/846941.jpg,4.62,[],99.0,1.0,,846941.The_Connected_Discourses_of_the_Buddha,,,,,98.0,295.0,2080,,Wisdom Publications,"['218', '48', '24', '3', '2']",,,[],,

For easy reference, the book is arrayed in ten thematic sections ranging from ""The Human Condition"" to ""Mastering the Mind"" to ""The Planes of Realization."" Each section comes with introductions, notes, and essays to help beginners and experts alike draw greater meaning from the Buddha's words. The book also features a general introduction by the author that fully lays out how and why he has arranged the Buddha's teachings in this volume. This thoughtful compilation is a valuable resource for both teachers and those who want to read the Buddha on their own.",,,01/01/05,July 28th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'History', 'Theology', 'Reference', 'Anthologies']",,9780861714919,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428915308l/209576.jpg,4.37,[],96.0,1.0,,209576.In_the_Buddha_s_Words,,,,,96.0,2752.0,486,,Wisdom Publications,"['1613', '696', '337', '71', '35']",,,[],,
Bhikkhu Bodhi (Translator),The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya,,English,,"Discover with the original teachings of the Buddha in this thorough translation of some of the oldest Buddhist texts in the world. Like the River Ganges flowing down from the Himalayas, the entire Buddhist tradition flows down to us from the teachings and deeds of the historical Buddha, who lived and taught in India during the fifth century B.C.E. To ensure that his legacy would survive the ravages of time, his direct disciples compiled records of the Buddha's teachings soon after his passing.In the Theravada Buddhist tradition, which prevails in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, these records are regarded as the definitive ""word of the Buddha."" Preserved in Pali, an ancient Indian language closely related to the language that the Buddha spoke, this full compilation of texts is known as the Pali Canon. At the heart of the Buddha's teaching were the suttas (Sanskrit sutras), his discourses and dialogues. If we want to find out what the Buddha himself actually said, these are the most ancient sources available to us. The suttas were compiled into collections called ""Nikayas,"" of which there are four, each organized according to a different principle. The Digha Nikaya consists of longer discourses; the Majjhima Nikaya of middle-length discourses; the Samyutta Nikaya of thematically connected discourses; and the Anguttara Nikaya of numerically patterned discourses. The Numerical Discourses  contains a full translation of the Anguttara Nikaya. The Anguttara arranges the Buddha's discourses in accordance with a numerical scheme intended to promote retention and easy comprehension. In an age when writing was still in its infancy, this proved to be the most effective way to ensure that the disciples could grasp and replicate the structure of a teaching.Here’s what makes the Numerical Discourses special:Insightful commentary from eminent scholar-monk Bhikkhu Bodhi Its comprehensive translation of the Anguttara Nikaya, part of the Pali Canon Teachings specifically for lay people and families Themes including family life, right livelihood, friendship, and meditation techniques laid out in a carefully organized thematic guide In 2013, Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi was awarded the 2013 Khyentse Foundation Prize for Outstanding Translation.Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation and compilation also includes a useful thematic guide to the Anguttara Nikaya, so that readers can browse the volume by topic. Find the teachings to further your practice and bring clarity to your life today by diving into this rich treasure of the Buddhist literary tradition. With this volume, readers can learn about the life of the Buddha, instructions for maintaining a harmonious household, monastic practice and lifestyle, meditation practice, and the Sangha (Buddhist community).",,,10/31/99,October 16th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Buddhism', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction']",,9781614290407,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562993469l/13594969._SY475_.jpg,4.72,[],100.0,1.0,,13594969-the-numerical-discourses-of-the-buddha,,,,,97.0,197.0,1944,,Wisdom Publications,"['165', '17', '9', '3', '3']",,,[],,
"Bhikkhu Bodhi (Translator), Bhikkhu Ñaṇamoli (Translator)",The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya,,English,,"This book offers a complete translation of the Majjhima Nikaya, or Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. This collection--among the oldest records of the historical Buddha's original teachings--consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikaya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.The translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Nanamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.Winner of the 1995 Choice Magazine Outstanding Academic Book Award, and the Tricycle Prize for Excellence in Buddhist Publishing for Dharma Discourse.",,,,November 9th 1995,[],Hardcover,"['Buddhism', 'Religion', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Eastern Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Scripture', 'Cultural', 'Unfinished']",,9780861710720,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388340396l/232708.jpg,4.53,[],98.0,1.0,,232708.The_Middle_Length_Discourses_of_the_Buddha,,,,,97.0,1106.0,1424,,Wisdom Publications,"['765', '213', '93', '21', '14']",,,[],,

  The memory pieces of the feelings being lost, absence, suffering and insecurity, of the boys facing their fate.
Would I be able to straighten out the errors and mistakes and save all of us? I didn't grasp the depth and weight of this question. It was true that I desperately wanted to save all of us. No one deserves to die, to despair, to be suppressed, and be despised. On top of that, they were my friends. We might've had our flaws and scars and have been twisted up and distorted. We might've been nobodies. But we were alive. We had days to live, plans to follow, and dreams to fulfill.At first, I didn't think much of it. I thought it'd all depend on how much effort I put in after I figured out who I needed to save and from what. That was what I'd thought. I believed I could solve it all by persuading them and changing things. I was that simple and naïve. But it was no more than an attempt to save my own skin. After a series of trials and errors, I had a realization. It wasn't so simple to save the others.

Bill Browder (Goodreads Author),"Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice",,English,,"A real-life political thriller about an American financier in the Wild East of Russia, the murder of his principled young tax attorney, and his dangerous mission to expose the Kremlin's corruption.Bill Browder's journey started on the South Side of Chicago and moved through Stanford Business School to the dog-eat-dog world of hedge fund investing in the 1990s. It continued in Moscow, where Browder made his fortune heading the largest investment fund in Russia after the Soviet Union's collapse. But when he exposed the corrupt oligarchs who were robbing the companies in which he was investing, Vladimir Putin turned on him and, in 2005, had him expelled from Russia. In 2007, a group of law enforcement officers raided Browder's offices in Moscow and stole $230 million of taxes that his fund's companies had paid to the Russian government. Browder's attorney Sergei Magnitsky investigated the incident and uncovered a sprawling criminal enterprise. A month after Sergei testified against the officials involved, he was arrested and thrown into pre-trial detention, where he was tortured for a year. On November 16, 2009, he was led to an isolation chamber, handcuffed to a bedrail, and beaten to death by eight guards in full riot gear. Browder glimpsed the heart of darkness, and it transformed his life: he embarked on an unrelenting quest for justice in Sergei's name, exposing the towering cover-up that leads right up to Putin.

Bill Bryson,A Short History of Nearly Everything,7 Steps to Financial Aid: Facilitator's Guide,,Science,"In this book Bill Bryson explores the most intriguing and consequential questions that science seeks to answer and attempts to understand everything that has transpired from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization. To that end, Bill Bryson apprenticed himself to a host of the world's most profound scientific minds, living and dead. His challenge is to take subjects like geology, chemistry, paleontology, astronomy, and particle physics and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people, like himself, made bored (or scared) stiff of science by school. His interest is not simply to discover what we know but to find out how we know it. How do we know what is in the center of the earth, thousands of miles beneath the surface? How can we know the extent and the composition of the universe, or what a black hole is? How can we know where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out? On his travels through space and time, Bill Bryson encounters a splendid gallery of the most fascinating, eccentric, competitive, and foolish personalities ever to ask a hard question. In their company, he undertakes a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge.",,,,2003.0,,,,096573840X,9780965738408,,,4.2,,,,,,,,,,,,545.0,,,,28.0,,,,

He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way—and a couple of bears.

Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before.Whether braving the homicidal motorist of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations.

But before leaving his much-loved Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around old Blighty, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had for so long been his home. The resulting book, Notes from a Small Island, is a eulogy to the country that produced Marmite, George Formby, by-elections, milky tea, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowels, Gardeners' Question Time and people who say, 'Mustn't grumble'. Britain will never seem the same again.Once ensconced back home in New Hampshire, Bryson couldn't resist the invitation to write a weekly dispatch for the Mail on Sunday's Night & Day magazine. Notes from a Big Country is a collection of eighteen months' worth of his popular columns about that strangest of phenomena - the American way of life.

In A Sunburned Country is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity.Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book.

Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.

Bill Bryson,Bill Bryson's African Diary,,English,,"In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.",,,11/06/02,December 3rd 2002,[],Hardcover,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Kenya', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'History', 'Autobiography']",,9780767915069,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388276959l/22.jpg,3.45,[],89.0,1.0,,22.Bill_Bryson_s_African_Diary,,,,,85.0,8670.0,55,,Broadway Books,"['1460', '2500', '3447', '1009', '254']",,,[],,

They are where history ends up.”Bill Bryson and his family live in a Victorian parsonage in a part of England where nothing of any great significance has happened since the Romans decamped. Yet one day, he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things of life as he found it in that comfortable home. To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to “write a history of the world without leaving home.” The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom, sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen, nutrition and the spice trade; and so on, as Bryson shows how each has figured in the evolution of private life.

Bill Bryson,"One Summer: America, 1927",,English,,"In One Summer Bill Bryson, one of our greatest and most beloved nonfiction writers, transports readers on a journey back to one amazing season in American life.The summer of 1927 began with one of the signature events of the twentieth century: on May 21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first man to cross the Atlantic by plane nonstop, and when he landed in Le Bourget airfield near Paris, he ignited an explosion of worldwide rapture and instantly became the most famous person on the planet. Meanwhile, the titanically talented Babe Ruth was beginning his assault on the home run record, which would culminate on September 30 with his sixtieth blast, one of the most resonant and durable records in sports history. In between those dates a Queens housewife named Ruth Snyder and her corset-salesman lover garroted her husband, leading to a murder trial that became a huge tabloid sensation. Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly sat atop a flagpole in Newark, New Jersey, for twelve days—a new record. The American South was clobbered by unprecedented rain and by flooding of the Mississippi basin, a great human disaster, the relief efforts for which were guided by the uncannily able and insufferably pompous Herbert Hoover. Calvin Coolidge interrupted an already leisurely presidency for an even more relaxing three-month vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The gangster Al Capone tightened his grip on the illegal booze business through a gaudy and murderous reign of terror and municipal corruption. The first true “talking picture,” Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer, was filmed and forever changed the motion picture industry. The four most powerful central bankers on earth met in secret session on a Long Island estate and made a fateful decision that virtually guaranteed a future crash and depression.     All this and much, much more transpired in that epochal summer of 1927, and Bill Bryson captures its outsized personalities, exciting events, and occasional just plain weirdness with his trademark vividness, eye for telling detail, and delicious humor. In that year America stepped out onto the world stage as the main event, and One Summer transforms it all into narrative nonfiction of the highest order.",,,08/01/13,October 1st 2013,"['Charles Lindbergh', 'Babe Ruth', 'Al Jolson', 'Herbert Hoover', 'Al Capone', 'Lou Gehrig', 'Philo Farnsworth', 'Gene Tunney', 'Jack Dempsey', 'Calvin Coolidge']",Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Baseball', 'American', 'Adult']",,9780767919401,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380292864l/17262366.jpg,4.08,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2013)'],290.0,4.0,,17262366-one-summer,,,,,95.0,44513.0,456,,Doubleday,"['16235', '18642', '7310', '1527', '799']",,,['United States of America'],,
"Bill Bryson, Goran Skrobonja (Translator)",The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid,,English,,"From one of the most beloved and bestselling authors in the English language, a vivid, nostalgic, and utterly hilarious memoir of growing up in the 1950sBill Bryson was born in the middle of the American century—1951—in the middle of the United States—Des Moines, Iowa—in the middle of the largest generation in American history—the baby boomers. As one of the best and funniest writers alive, he is perfectly positioned to mine his memories of a totally all-American childhood for 24-carat memoir gold. Like millions of his generational peers, Bill Bryson grew up with a rich fantasy life as a superhero. In his case, he ran around his house and neighborhood with an old football jersey with a thunderbolt on it and a towel about his neck that served as his cape, leaping tall buildings in a single bound and vanquishing awful evildoers (and morons)—in his head—as ""The Thunderbolt Kid."" Using this persona as a springboard, Bill Bryson re-creates the life of his family and his native city in the 1950s in all its transcendent normality—a life at once completely familiar to us all and as far away and unreachable as another galaxy. It was, he reminds us, a happy time, when automobiles and televisions and appliances (not to mention nuclear weapons) grew larger and more numerous with each passing year, and DDT, cigarettes, and the fallout from atmospheric testing were considered harmless or even good for you. He brings us into the life of his loving but eccentric family, including affectionate portraits of his father, a gifted sportswriter for the local paper and dedicated practitioner of isometric exercises, and OF his mother, whose job as the home furnishing editor for the same paper left her little time for practicing the domestic arts at home. The many readers of Bill Bryson’s earlier classic, A Walk in the Woods, will greet the reappearance in these pages of the immortal Stephen Katz, seen hijacking literally boxcar loads of beer. He is joined in the Bryson gallery of immortal characters by the demonically clever Willoughby brothers, who apply their scientific skills and can-do attitude to gleefully destructive ends. Warm and laugh-out-loud funny, and full of his inimitable, pitch-perfect observations, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid is as wondrous a book as Bill Bryson has ever written.

Bill C. Castengera (Goodreads Author),Shift!,,,,"Humankind is evolving. Technology has advanced to the point where God is feeling obsolete and so He has become an alcoholic and is threatening to destroy the world.  An error in judgement leads to a cloning experiment that might just wipe out the world before God can do it Himself, reminding him again that He has become obsolete.  Depressed, confused, and vulnerable, God must make a decision. The ability to sway His decision rests on four people who do not know their role in His plan.  Pablo Benito, afflicted with an advanced case of OCD, fears death is waiting for him at every turn. Kyle Fredrick, a drummer for a wildly popular rap/metal band is a loose cannon, and has stabbed his lead singer in the eye with a plastic fork. Adam Brooks is a scientist, trying to develop a new way to travel, and minister Faldo is a champion of the Lord to his core.  Mankind will fall to it's knees if God cannot be swayed.

Bill Clinton,My Life,,English,,"An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton's My Life is a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a ""vast right-wing operation"" determined to destroy him, and the ""morally indefensible"" acts for which he was nearly impeached. My Life is autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons. Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makes My Life remarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice: I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain. However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion and Kitchen Confidential-type revelations about ""what it is like to be President"" make My Life impossible to put down. To Clinton, ""politics is a contact sport,"" and while he claims that My Life is not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to ""take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could."" While My Life is primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose ""mindless search for scandal"" protected the guilty while ""persecuting the innocent"" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed. At its core, My Life is a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to ""drain the most out of every moment"" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today. --Daphne Durham",,,10/30/04,May 31st 2005,['Bill Clinton'],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Presidents', 'Biography Memoir', 'American History', 'Audiobook']",,9781400030033,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431741967l/49195._SY475_.jpg,3.73,"['Audie Award for Audiobook of the Year (2005)', 'Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album (2005)']",98.0,1.0,,49195.My_Life,,,,,88.0,43964.0,969,,Vintage,"['12025', '14992', '11742', '3331', '1874']",,,['Arkansas (United States)'],,

And there's more: the Reference section covers Win Shares for each season and each player, and even offers a Win Share team comparison. A must-have for baseball fans and historians alike, The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract is as essential, entertaining, and enlightening as the sport itself.",,,10/28/85,June 13th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Baseball', 'Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Reference', 'American', 'Mathematics', 'Research', 'Games', 'American History']",,9780743227223,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442365633l/232459._SX318_.jpg,4.25,[],273.0,3.0,,232459.The_New_Bill_James_Historical_Baseball_Abstract,,,,,94.0,5304.0,1024,,Free Press,"['2838', '1450', '672', '210', '134']",,,[],,
Bill Johnson,The Supernatural Power Of A Transformed Mind,,English,,"
  Moving in the spiritual realm should be as much a part of a believer's routine as prayer, worship and reading Scripture. Yet all too often, Christians practice an intellectual faith, which lacks any supernatural punch. Healing, deliverance and signs and wonders are an inheritance for all followers of Jesus Christ. The Supernatural Power of a Transformed Mind teaches you how to remove the blinders of religious limitation to redeem the lost and transform communities. You too can tap into an abundance of miracle-working authority and unleash the power of God's glory.

Bill Karwin,SQL Antipatterns,,English,,"Bill Karwin has helped thousands of people write better SQL and build stronger relational databases. Now he's sharing his collection of antipatterns--the most common errors he's identified in those thousands of requests for help. Most developers aren't SQL experts, and most of the SQL that gets used is inefficient, hard to maintain, and sometimes just plain wrong. This book shows you all the common mistakes, and then leads you through the best fixes. What's more, it shows you what's behind these fixes, so you'll learn a lot about relational databases along the way. Each chapter in this book helps you identify, explain, and correct a unique and dangerous antipattern. The four parts of the book group the anti​patterns in terms of logical database design, physical database design, queries, and application development. The chances are good that your application's database layer already contains problems such as Index Shotgun, Keyless Entry, Fear of the Unknown, and Spaghetti Query. This book will help you and your team find them. Even better, it will also show you how to fix them, and how to avoid these and other problems in the future. SQL Antipatterns gives you a rare glimpse into an SQL expert's playbook. Now you can stamp out these common database errors once and for all. Whatever platform or programming language you use, whether you're a junior programmer or a Ph.D., SQL Antipatterns will show you how to design and build databases, how to write better database queries, and how to integrate SQL programming with your application like an expert.

"Bill Kovach, Tom Rosenstiel",Sembilan Elemen Jurnalisme,,Indonesian,,"These are tough times for journalism. Newsroom executives' bonuses tend to be based on their company's profit margin. Journalists are constantly jockeying for the time and space necessary to tell their stories as they see fit. Only 47 percent of Americans even read a newspaper. And Time and Newsweek--news magazines, remember?--""were seven times more likely to have the same cover story as People magazine in 1997 than in 1977."" It's no wonder that in 1997, the Committee of Concerned Journalists formed to ""engage journalists and the public in a careful examination of what journalism was supposed to be."" The Elements of Journalism reports the results of that study, which included 21 public forums (attended by 3,000 people), in-depth interviews with 100 journalists, editorial content studies, and research into the history of journalism. Part of what the committee members learned, they already knew. Journalism is complicated business: journalists are paid by management but work for the citizens; they tend to be self-taught (there is little evidence of mentoring and much disdain for journalism schools); and they need to be objective even when they're not impartial. This has always been the case. But the committee also detected a trend, one abundantly evident to anyone who has tried to find news on the evening TV news: ""news was becoming entertainment and entertainment news."" ""Unless we can grasp and reclaim the theory of a free press,"" warn Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, the book's authors, ""journalists risk allowing their profession to disappear."" Through their discussions with journalists, the Committee of Concerned Journalists defined nine ""clear principles"" of journalism, which Kovach and Rosenstiel explore in great detail. The first principle is, ""Journalism's first obligation is to the truth."" The last: ""Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience."" In between come issues of loyalty, verification, independence, and power monitoring, among others.

Bill Myers (Goodreads Author),The God Hater,,English,,"A cranky, atheistic philosophy professor loves to shred the faith of incoming freshmen. He is chosen by a group of scientists to create a philosophy for a computer-generated world exactly like ours. Much to his frustration every model he introduces—from Darwinism, to Existentialism, to Relativism, to Buddhism—fails. The only way to preserve the computer world is to introduce laws from outside their system through a Law Giver. Of course this goes against everything he's ever believed, and he hates it. But even that doesn't completely work because the citizens of that world become legalists and completely miss the spirit behind the Law. The only way to save them is to create a computer character like himself to personally live and explain it. He does. So now there are two of him—the one in our world and the one in the computer world. Unfortunately a rival has introduced a virus into the computer world.

With infectious enthusiasm, he reveals the mechanics of evolutionary theory, explains how it is rooted in the testable and verifiable scientific method, and why it is therefore a sound explanation of our beginning.

Bill O'Reilly (Goodreads Author),A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity,,English,,"The year was 1957, the month September, and I had just turned eight years old. Dwight Eisenhower was President, but in my life it was the diminutive, intense Sister Mary Lurana who ruled, at least in the third-grade class where I was held captive. For reasons you will soon understand, my parents had remanded me to the penal institution of St. Brigid's School in Westbury, New York, a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one. Already, I had barely survived my first two years at St. Brigid's because I was, well, a little nitwit. Not satisfied with memorizing the Baltimore Catechism's fine prose, which featured passages like ""God made me to show his goodness and to make me happy with him in heaven,"" I was constantly annoying my classmates and, of course, the no-nonsense Sister Lurana. With sixty overactive students in her class, she was understandably short on patience. For survival, she had also become quick on the draw. Then it happened. One day I blurted out some dumb remark, and Sister Lurana was on me like a panther. Her black habit blocked out all distractions as she leaned down, looked me in the eye, and uttered words I have never forgotten: ""William, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity."" And she was dead-on. One day in 1957, in the third-grade classroom of St. Brigid's parochial school, an exasperated Sister Mary Lurana bent over a restless young William O'Reilly and said, ""William, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity."" Little did she know that she was, early in his career as a troublemaker, defining the essence of Bill O'Reilly and providing him with the title of his brash and entertaining issues-based memoir. And this time it's personal. In his most intimate book yet, O'Reilly goes back in time to examine the people, places, and experiences that launched him on his journey from working-class kid to immensely influential television personality and bestselling author. Readers will learn how his traditional outlook was formed in the crucible of his family, his neighborhood, his church, and his schools, and how his views on America's proper role in the world emerged from covering four wars on five continents over three-plus decades as a news correspondent. What will delight his numerous fans and surprise many others is the humor and self-deprecation with which he handles one of his core subjects: himself, and just how O'Reilly became O'Reilly.",,,01/01/08,September 23rd 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'American History', 'New York']",,9780767928823,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442766195l/3255666._SY475_.jpg,3.91,[],98.0,1.0,,3255666-a-bold-fresh-piece-of-humanity,,,,,92.0,4925.0,256,,Crown Archetype,"['1557', '1914', '1071', '241', '142']",,,['United States of America'],,

  A riveting historical narrative of the heart-stopping events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the first work of history from mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly
The anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history—how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth—charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist—murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions—including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt. Featuring some of history's most remarkable figures, vivid detail, and page-turning action, Killing Lincoln is history that reads like a thriller. http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebre...~",Bill O'Reilly's Killing Series,First Edition,,September 27th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Civil War', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Presidents', 'True Crime']",,9780805093070,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793681l/10587120.jpg,4.03,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)'],222.0,3.0,,10587120-killing-lincoln,,,,,92.0,92255.0,324,,Henry Holt & Company,"['35943', '33919', '15123', '3698', '3572']",,,[],,

Bill Simmons,The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to The Sports Guy,,English,,"There is only one writer on the planet who possesses enough basketball knowledge and passion to write the definitive book on the NBA.* Bill Simmons, the from-the-womb hoops addict known to millions as ESPN.com’s Sports Guy, is that writer. And The Book of Basketball is that book. Nowhere in the roundball universe will you find another single volume that covers as much in such depth as this wildly opinionated and thoroughly entertaining look at the past, present, and future of pro basketball.From the age-old question of who actually won the rivalry between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to the one about which team was truly the best of all time, Simmons opens–and then closes, once and for all–every major pro basketball debate. Then he takes it further by completely reevaluating not only how NBA Hall of Fame inductees should be chosen but how the institution must be reshaped from the ground up, the result being the Pyramid: Simmons’s one-of-a-kind, five-level shrine to the ninety-six greatest players in the history of pro basketball. And ultimately he takes fans to the heart of it all, as he uses a conversation with one NBA great to uncover that coveted thing: The Secret of Basketball.Comprehensive, authoritative, controversial, hilarious, and impossible to put down (even for Celtic-haters), The Book of Basketball offers every hardwood fan a courtside seat beside the game’s finest, funniest, and fiercest chronicler.* More to the point, he’s the only one crazy enough to try to pull it off.

Calvin's the kid we all wish we'd been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy -- and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers ""Candid Opinions"" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents' authority. ""What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?"" he demands. Calvin and Hobbes manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: ""Eww, mud,"" says Calvin.

Bill White,America's Fiscal Constitution: Its Triumph and Collapse,,,,"What would Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, the Roosevelts, Truman, and Eisenhower have done about today's federal debt crisis? America's Fiscal Constitution tells the remarkable story of fiscal heroes who imposed clear limits on the use of federal debt, limits that for two centuries were part of an unwritten constitution. Those national leaders borrowed only for extraordinary purposes and relied on well-defined budget practices to balance federal spending and revenues.  That traditional fiscal constitution collapsed in 2001. Afterward -- for the first time in history -- federal elected officials cut taxes during war, funded permanent new programs entirely with debt, grew dependent on foreign creditors, and claimed that the economy could not thrive without routine federal borrowing. For most of the nation's history, conservatives fought to restrain the growth of government by insisting that new programs be paid for with taxation, while progressives sought to preserve opportunities for people on the way up by balancing budgets. Virtually all mainstream politicians recognized that excessive debt could jeopardize private investment and national independence. With original scholarship and the benefit of experience in finance and public service, Bill White dispels common budget myths and distills practical lessons from the nation's five previous spikes in debt. America's Fiscal Constitution offers an objective and hopeful guide for people trying to make sense of the nation's current, most severe, debt crisis and its impact on their lives and our future.",,,01/28/14,April 1st 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Economics', 'Government']",,9781610393430,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366561268l/17802766.jpg,3.97,[],99.0,1.0,,17802766-america-s-fiscal-constitution,,,,,97.0,30.0,576,,PublicAffairs,"['10', '10', '9', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Bill Yenne (Goodreads Author),"Area 51 - Black Jets: A History of the Aircraft Developed at Groom Lake, America's Secret Aviation Base",,English,,"Area 51's most important military aviation developments are profiled in an illustrated format. When most of us think of Area 51, we think of aliens, UFOs, and controversial government cover-ups. It's easy to forget that, since the mid-1950s, the United States' famed extension of Edwards Air Force Base has served as a top-secret CIA testing ground for many of the most groundbreaking advancements in American military aviation technology. In Area 51 - Black Jets, author and military historian Bill Yenne offers the first fully illustrated chronology of Area 51's most famous aircraft projects, including Lockheed's U-2 ""Dragon Lady"" and SR-71 ""Blackbird"" reconnaissance planes, drones ranging from the early Lockheed D-21 to the modern-day General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and the famous F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter produced by the Have Blue program during the 1970s. Each project is given its own fascinating chapter illuminating the aircraft's development at this famed location. But beyond the aircraft themselves, Area 51 - Black Jets also covers a handful of the many classified experimental programs carried out at Area 51 over the years, such as Have Doughnut, Have Ferry, and Have Drill - secret undertakings that successfully reverse-engineered such enemy aircraft as the Russian MiG during the Cold War. Presented in beautiful hardcover format and illustrated with historic color and black-and-white photographs, diagrams, and maps, this book reveals Area 51 for what it truly is: a clandestine area for the United States' most cutting-edge technological innovators in military aviation.",,,01/01/14,March 15th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Aviation', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History', 'Nonfiction']",,9780760344262,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384382508l/18249261.jpg,4.07,[],64.0,1.0,,18249261-area-51---black-jets,,,,,96.0,92.0,192,,Zenith Press,"['33', '36', '19', '4', '0']",,,[],,

Billy Crystal,"Still Foolin' 'Em: Where I've Been, Where I'm Going, and Where the Hell Are My Keys",,English,,"Hilarious and heartfelt observations on aging from one of America’s favorite comedians as he turns 65, and a look back at a remarkable careerBilly Crystal is turning 65, and he’s not happy about it. With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like “Buying the Plot” and “Nodding Off,” Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live, When Harry Met Sally, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards. Readers get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever “test positive for Maalox”), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion (“the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac”), grandparenting, and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal’s reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived.

Not only its present but also how I viewed its past.Apart from our struggles with managers, publicists, security and even one or two of the artists themselves, we ran into so many people from ordinary walks of life; cab drivers, hotel porters, fans standing in line to see their heroes, who couldn’t do enough to help or encourage us on our journey.For one long summer, we lived life so brilliantly; so full of laughter and a gathering sense of achievement that I wondered if the artists we were pursuing ever got to see life in anything like the same way.In contrast they seemed so protected, so hidden away, so cut off from the world that, towards the end of our travels, the thought occurred to me that, at that point in time, I wouldn’t swap one year of their lives for one day of ours.My hope is that, in reading my account of those heady days, you will understand why.Billy Franks",,First Edition,,September 19th 2012,[],Paperback,[],,9781479340903,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1350676458l/16092672.jpg,4.33,[],93.0,1.0,,16092672-a-far-cry-from-sunset,,,,,97.0,39.0,196,,The B-Spot!,"['21', '11', '6', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Billy Graham,The Secret of Happiness,,English,,"Happiness. It's what we all long for, what all human beings seek in our jobs, our relationships, our activities. We try so hard to be happy, and all too often we end up empty and unsatisfied. Why? Because, says Billy Graham in this classic work, we are looking for happiness in all the wrong places. We haven't learned the secret Jesus taught in the Beatitudes – that true, lasting happiness simply isn't to be found by seeking it directly. Happiness is a by-product, a bonus that comes when we seek what is really important. And the things that will bring us the satisfaction we long for are not necessarily what the world considers meaningful.Jesus did not have to have an outward stimulus to make Him happy, Billy Graham points out. ""He had learned a secret that allowed Him to live above the circumstances of life and fear of the future. He moved with calmness, certainty, and serenity through the most trying circumstances – even death! What was His secret? He gave it to us in the Beautitudes.""Presented with Billy Graham's characteristic vigor and simplicity in this landmark book, it is a secret that can transform your life.",,,10/30/55,September 7th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Christian', 'Religion', 'Christian Living', 'Inspirational', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity']",,9781593280673,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380857988l/2331988.jpg,4.19,[],95.0,1.0,,2331988.The_Secret_of_Happiness,,,,,96.0,237.0,176,,Thomas Nelson,"['114', '68', '45', '6', '4']",,,[],,

Bjørn Lomborg,Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming,,English,,"Bjørn Lomborg is the best-informed & most humane advocate for environmental change in the world today. In contrast to other figures that promote a single issue while ignoring others, he views the globe as a whole, studies all the problems, ranks them, & determines how best, & in what order, to address them. His 1st book, The Skeptical Environmentalist, established the importance of a fact-based approach. With later books, Global Crises, Global Solutions & How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place, this mild-mannered Danish statistician has steadily gained new converts. Not surprisingly, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Cool It will further enhance his reputation for global analysis & thoughtful response. For anyone who wants an overview of the global warming debate from an objective source, this brief text is a good place to start. He's only interested in real problems. He's no patience with media fear-mongering. He begins by dispatching the myth of endangered polar bears, showing that this Disneyesque cartoon has no relevance to the real world where polar bear populations are in fact increasing. He considers the issue in detail, citing sources from Al Gore to the World Wildlife Fund, then demonstrating that polar bear populations have actually increased fivefold since the '60s. He then works his way thru the concerns we hear so much about: higher temperatures, heat deaths, species extinctions, the cost of cutting carbon, the technology to do it. He believes in climate change--despite his critics, he's no denier--but his fact-based approach, grounded in economic analyses, leads him to a different view. He reviews published estimates of the cost of climate change, & the cost of addressing it, & concludes that ""we actually end up paying more for a partial solution than the cost of the entire problem. That is a bad deal."" In some of the most disturbing chapters, he recounts what leading climate figures have said about anyone who questions the orthodoxy, thus demonstrating the illiberal, antidemocratic tone of the current debate. He himself takes the larger view, detailing why the tone of hysteria is inappropriate to addressing the problems. In the end, his concerns embrace the planet. He contrasts our concern for climate with other concerns such as HIV/AIDS, malnutrition & providing clean water. In the end, his ability to put climate in a global perspective is perhaps the book's greatest value. Lomborg & Cool It are our best guides to our shared environmental future.--Michael Crichton (edited)",,,01/01/07,September 11th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Environment', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Climate Change', 'Sustainability', 'Global Warming', 'Audiobook', 'Nature']",,9780307266927,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423247804l/384311.jpg,3.71,[],90.0,1.0,,384311.Cool_It,,,,,88.0,1007.0,253,,Alfred A.

According to Ebony Brown’s first assessment of Raymond White, he was one such person. And his hood rat trustees, Shuntay, Sonya and Tina, she was convinced had the self esteem of a rice cake.Truth is, some folks are ruined before they’re even old enough to take responsibility for themselves. So when they view their own lives as fucked up, they can’t find worth in the lives of others. That was Raymond White. Not only did his mother deem him a wasted birth but from an early age, he seemed determined to prove himself to be just that.	The self proclaimed, sweet Ray was always claiming something he wasn’t and would never be. And he was always going after something he could never have. 	By the time he was a teenager, his warped sense of worth, paired with advice from his less then stellar followers, convinced him that he was untouchable. He wanted Ebony from first sight but she wasn’t having it. So, he started plotting on how he could have her. Willingly or not. Raymond proves why arrogance and low self esteem combined, are a recipe for disaster. And that’s exactly what him, Shuntay, Sonya and Tina had shopped for, when they plotted an attack to ruin Miss Ebony “baby girl” Brown.	Ebony’s man was Anthony “Ajay” Jackson. The rats were infatuated highly with him and that made Raymond jealous and more determined that he should have Ajay’s girl. Though Ajay warned him not to go near her, Raymond decided to ignore those warnings. That set him on a deadly course. Raymond had harmed others in the past and gotten away with it. That made him think he was invincible. He went through with his mission to steal Ajay’s heaven. From that day on, he was living in his last days. 	Some warnings should be heeded and when someone tells you they aren’t interested in you, you would be wise to adhere to those wishes.

Black Coffee,"The Making of AJAY-""Every Man""-RELOADED-,A Time Will Reveal Novel (Time Will Reveal-RELOADED Book 8)",,English,,"What qualifies a male to be seen as a man, comes from how he’s viewed through the eyes of those in his world. Who that man is, stems from how he’s reared. The lessons he’s taught and the knowledge he takes from those lessons, will manifest as he grows and becomes the man that his world sees. Thus how valuable those teachings are to him, will translate to others by the way he lives his life. AJAY learned about his legacy from his father, his grandfather and the males in his crew. He learned to love his woman, unconditionally. That's what he saw and valued from his forefathers. He also learned how he was expected to carry out that legacy. He’s a man now and he has done well. He’s lived up to his expectations. He’s a father now and the most important part of those lessons, have to now be passed on to his male seed. This is AJAY Jackson: The man, the husband and the father giving the legacy he grew from, over to his only son, lil AJAY. AJAY’s main responsibility is to make sure his son grows up to be a stronger man than him. Which means his toughest job is before him. He has a junior who,s just as head strong and stern. But with even less patience for dishonesty. Lil AJAY already shows that he’s honest, loyal and committed to the family’s creed. The reader will learn of AJAY’s early life, through his weekly talks with his son. Witness how lil AJAY gets to know how his father became the person, whom he views as simply, “The Man.” Lil AJAY is already curious about how his pops learned to love his mother Ebony, the way he’s witnessed him doing, during his 6 years of life. This novel shows you how the man, we know as AJAY, was made and how through lil AJAY that ""Every Man"" legacy will continue. “Every woman wants to be made love too, thoroughly. That’s the only way she’ll know she has you. But a real man won’t kiss nor give that kind of treatment, to every woman. That’s only for his one and only and the one he wants to have and hold, forever. Thorough love making is an art, son. That’s something Jackson men are known for and you’ll have to hold up for that name too. The art of loving a woman takes a lot of preparation. You have to study her, learn what she likes and what she doesn’t like. Not every man can do that. Because he’s never been schooled on what it takes to satisfy his woman. But my daddy told me and I’m gonna make sure you know it too. Pussy will be coming at you, from every angle and direction. That’s because of how you’ll carry yourself. All men fuck. But only real men make love. I learned how to please my woman. Your mama is well taken care of. In ways you can see and ways you’ll never see. My number one thought when I lay eyes on her, is what new ways can I please her and leave her smiling. I’m thinking like that, even when she’s not around. Don’t ever leave the woman you love, wanting more. Because she’ll find it somewhere, other than with you, if she has too. For a Jackson man, that’s a no-no. We don’t share our woman sexually, with anyone. She has to have morals. She has to be a woman who keeps you on your toes too. With positive shit. Good shit, that’s for the betterment of you. She can only chastise you, when it’s for your own good. You have to be man enough to know that she has the right to do that. The good ones just seem to know when to do it. To keep her faithful, you've gotta have the upper hand, long before the sex starts. A real man has it and maintains it, even after she submits to him. I have it and that’s a fact. Good loving keeps your home peaceful. Keeps your woman smiling, in her place and happy. Good loving keeps the order in your relationship and in and in your life too. But your best loving is only for that, one woman.

Black Elk;John Gneisenau Neihardt;Alexis N. Petri;Lori Utecht,Black Elk Speaks,Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux,,Biography & Autobiography,"Black Elk Speaks is the story of the Lakota visionary and healer Nicholas Black Elk (1863-1950) and his people during the momentous twilight years of the nineteenth century. Black Elk met the distinguished poet, writer, and critic John G. Neihardt (1881-1973) in 1930 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and chose Neihardt to tell his story. Neihardt understood and conveyed Black Elk’s experiences in this powerful and inspirational message for all humankind. When Black Elk received his great vision, white settlers were invading the Lakotas’ homeland, decimating buffalo herds, and threatening to extinguish the Lakotas’ way of life. The Lakotas fought fiercely to retain their freedom and way of life, a dogged resistance that resulted in a remarkable victory at the Little Bighorn and an unspeakable tragedy at Wounded Knee. Black Elk Speaks offers much more than a precious glimpse of a vanished time, however. As related by Neihardt, Black Elk’s searing visions of the unity of humanity and the earth have made this book a venerated spiritual classic. Whether appreciated as the poignant tale of a Lakota life, a history of a Native nation, or an enduring spiritual testament, Black Elk Speaks is unforgettable. This new edition features two additional essays by John G. Neihardt that further illuminate his experience with Black Elk; an essay by Alexis Petri, great-granddaughter of John G. Neihardt, that celebrates Neihardt’s remarkable accomplishments; and a look at the legacy of the special relationship between Neihardt and Black Elk, written by Lori Utecht, editor of Knowledge and Opinion: Essays and Literary Criticism of John G.

Blake Butler,Scorch Atlas,,English,,"In this striking novel-in-stories, a series of strange apocalypses have hit America. Entire neighborhoods drown in mud, glass rains from the sky, birds speak gibberish, and parents of young children disappear. Millions starve while others grow coats of mold.

Because of this, The Heroes of Time decided there was no other choice but to drain Sauluma of his remaining magical energy, then lock him away in a fragment of time.The heroes and their faithful companions were praised left and right, but inwardly, they weren’t celebrating.They knew one day that Sauluma could return, but men forget quickly. The people grew used to their security and safety. When the heroes warned those in power about the dragon, they were dismissed time and time again.The Heroes of Time knew better, and continued to ponder the issue with their closest friends and allies.

  ""What ardent, dazzling souls emerge from these American missionaries in China . . . A beautiful, searing book that leaves an indelible presence in the mind."" —Patricia Hampl, author of The Florist's Daughter 
Will Kiehn is seemingly destined for life as a humble farmer in the Midwest when, having felt a call from God, he travels to the vast North China Plain in the early twentieth-century. There he is surprised by love and weds a strong and determined fellow missionary, Katherine. They soon find themselves witnesses to the crumbling of a more than two-thousand-year-old dynasty that plunges the country into decades of civil war. As the couple works to improve the lives of the people of Kuang P'ing Ch'eng— City of Tranquil Light, a place they come to love—and face incredible hardship, will their faith and relationship be enough to sustain them? Told through Will and Katherine's alternating viewpoints—and inspired by the lives of the author's maternal grandparents—City of Tranquil Light is a tender and elegiac portrait of a young marriage set against the backdrop of the shifting face of a beautiful but torn nation. A deeply spiritual book, it shows how those who work to teach others often have the most to learn, and is further evidence that Bo Caldwell writes ""vividly and with great historical perspective"" (San Jose Mercury News).

Joe is a true go-getter, though sometimes he feels as if the harder and faster he works, the further away his goals seem to be. And so one day, desperate to land a key sale at the end of a bad quarter, he seeks advice from the enigmatic Pindar, a legendary consultant referred to by his many devotees simply as the Chairman. Over the next week, Pindar introduces Joe to a series of “go-givers:” a restaurateur, a CEO, a financial adviser, a real estate broker, and the “Connector,” who brought them all together. Pindar’s friends share with Joe the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success and teach him how to open himself up to the power of giving.

This book is as bitchy and packed with names as its readers could want. The Andy Warhol Factory is described (not surprisingly) as an exploitative place where Andy got richer and richer while his drones worked harder and harder. Colacello's straightforward chronology of working and partying in Warhol's circle is tinged by his bitterness over a heavy workload and little pay at the Factory. His tone captures perfectly the self-obsessed philosophy that drove Warhol, his hangers-on, and the subculture of sex, drugs, parties, discos, and the New York art scene of the 1970s and early 1980s.

In his first year there, Will is chasing his dream of eventually playing in the NFL. His hopes all ride on the team's star receiver who goes by the name of Machete. Machete has caught the NFL scouts' attention and is projected to go high in the draft after his senior season. As Machete is all but guaranteed a spot in the NFL, Will pins his hopes on one of the scouts taking notice of him during practice and remembering him come draft day. But Will's hopes and dreams are about to be shattered. One night during an off campus incident, Will and some of his teammates go to some nearby apartments to help a teammate who is in a confrontation with Machete and some of his gang members. As words are exchanged between the football team and the gang, a gun is brought out and Will is shot nine times on Machete's orders, and left to die. Will is fortunate enough to survive the attack but his football days at Delaware state are over. Will returns home and starts the recovery process. As for Machete, he accepts a plea deal and serves six months in prison. Will fights daily with his anger and thoughts of revenge, reliving that fateful night in his dreams over and over.

Bob Dylan,Chronicles,Volume One,,Biography & Autobiography,"WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE The celebrated first memoir from arguably the most influential singer-songwriter in the country, Bob Dylan. “I’d come from a long ways off and had started a long ways down. But now destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else.” So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career. Through Dylan’s eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan’s New York is a magical city of possibilities—smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book’s side trips to New Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota, and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times. By turns revealing, poetical, passionate, and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan’s thoughts and influences. Dylan’s voice is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful, and rhythmic.

Bob Dylan,Tarantula,,English,,"WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE Music legend Bob Dylan's only work of fiction—a combination of stream of consciousness prose, lyrics, and poetry that gives fans insight into one of the most influential singer-songwriters of our time.Written in 1966, Tarantula is a collection of poems and prose that evokes the turbulence of the times in which it was written, and gives a unique insight into Dylan's creative evolution. It captures Bob Dylan's preoccupations at a crucial juncture in his artistic development, showcasing the imagination of a folk poet laureate who was able to combine the humanity and compassion of his country roots with the playful surrealism of modern art. Angry, funny, and strange, the poems and prose in this collection reflect the concerns found in Dylan's most seminal music: a sense of protest, a verbal playfulness and spontaneity, and a belief in the artistic legitimacy of chronicling everyday life and eccentricity on the street.",,,10/30/71,October 19th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Music', 'Fiction', 'Nobel Prize', 'American', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'The United States Of America', 'Poetry Plays']",,9780743230414,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347337122l/132025.jpg,3.26,[],169.0,2.0,,132025.Tarantula,,,,,74.0,3200.0,144,,Scribner,"['576', '768', '1030', '570', '256']",,,[],,
Bob Dylan,Chronicles: Volume One,,English,,"""I'd come from a long ways off and had started a long ways down. But now destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else."" So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career. Through Dylan's eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan's New York is a magical city of possibilities -- smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book's side trips to New Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times.By turns revealing, poetical, passionate and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan's thoughts and influences. Dylan's voice is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful and rhythmic.

Bob Greene,"Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War",,English,,"When Bob Greene went home to central Ohio to be with his dying father, it set off a chain of events that led him to knowing his dad in a way he never had before—thanks to a quiet man who lived just a few miles away, a man who had changed the history of the world.Greene's father—a soldier with an infantry division in World War II—often spoke of seeing the man around town. All but anonymous even in his own city, carefully maintaining his privacy, this man, Greene's father would point out to him, had ""won the war."" He was Paul Tibbets. At the age of twenty-nine, at the request of his country, Tibbets assembled a secret team of 1,800 American soldiers to carry out the single most violent act in the history of mankind. In 1945 Tibbets piloted a plane—which he called Enola Gay, after his mother—to the Japanese city of Hiroshima, where he dropped the atomic bomb.On the morning after the last meal he ever ate with his father, Greene went to meet Tibbets. What developed was an unlikely friendship that allowed Greene to discover things about his father, and his father's generation of soldiers, that he never fully understood before. Duty is the story of three lives connected by history, proximity, and blood; indeed, it is many stories, intimate and achingly personal as well as deeply historic. In one soldier's memory of a mission that transformed the world—and in a son's last attempt to grasp his father's ingrained sense of honor and duty—lies a powerful tribute to the ordinary heroes of an extraordinary time in American life.What Greene came away with is found history and found poetry—a profoundly moving work that offers a vividly new perspective on responsibility, empathy, and love. It is an exploration of and response to the concept of duty as it once was and always should be: quiet and from the heart.

Bob Kealing,"Tupperware Unsealed: Brownie Wise, Earl Tupper, and the Home Party Pioneers",,English,,"Brownie Wise, the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week, was the driving force behind making Tupperware a household name. Fired under mysterious circumstances, she was written out of Tupperware history and died in obscurity. A trailblazing businesswoman decades ahead of her time, Wise created the Tupperware ""home party"" phenomenon in the 1950s. Her drive and creativity fueled sales and profits for the once sleepy plastic containers company. Earl Tupper anointed Wise as the company figurehead and marketing guru. Long before Disney, her lavish national headquarters drew tourists from near and far to the outskirts of Orlando, Florida, where she held court with the press, politicians, and movie stars. Wise's idea to market Tupperware exclusively through in-home sales sparked a cultural revolution in post World War II America. For the first time, minimally educated and economically invisible housewives had opportunities for careers. She became a cultlike, charismatic leader for the Tupperware faithful, so popular that ""Tupperware Ladies"" would vie to win the clothes right off her back. Behind the scenes, few knew Wise was stalked by her alcoholic and abusive ex-husband and feared him appearing out of nowhere to cause shame, embarrassment, or worse. The adoration from a legion of Tupperware dealers made her sudden fall from grace even more shocking and dramatic. At the height of her national celebrity, Tupper unceremoniously released her from the company. Journalist Bob Kealing has interviewed pioneering executives who helped build the company alongside Wise, reviewed hundreds of primary source documents written by Tupper and Wise, and obtained access to a wealth of previously unknown information, including sealed court depositions regarding a series of boat accidents successfully kept out of the press by the company, and details of secret recordings made by Tupperware Home Parties management seeking to prevent their distributors from unionizing. Wise's rise and fall, and her relationship with the eccentric Tupper, is the stuff of legend; a story told finally, and fully, in Tupperware Unsealed.",,,10/30/08,May 25th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Business', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Autobiography', 'American History']",,9780813032276,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328812111l/2875746.jpg,3.45,[],98.0,1.0,,2875746-tupperware-unsealed,,,,,87.0,422.0,264,,University Press of Florida,"['58', '136', '175', '42', '11']",,,[],,

  Water for Elephants
 In Bob Tarte's home, pandemonium is the order of the day, and animals literally rule the roost—thirty-nine of them at last count. Whether it's the knot-tying African grey parrot, or the overweight cat who's trained Bob to hold her water bowl just above the floor, or the nightmarish duck who challenges him to a shoving match, this menagerie, along with his endlessly optimistic wife, Linda, provides daily lessons on the chaos inherent in our lives. But not until this modern-day Noah's Ark hits stormy weather—and Bob's world spins out of control—does he realize that this exuberant gaggle of animals provides his spiritual anchor. It is their alien presence, their sense of humor, and their impulsive behavior that both drive Bob crazy and paradoxically return him to sanity. With the same sly humor and dead-on character portraits that made Enslaved by Ducks such a rousing success, Tarte proves that life with animals offers a wholly different perspective on the world.",,,03/01/07,March 16th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'Memoir', 'Birds', 'Nature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography']",,9781565125025,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404577305l/120405.jpg,3.68,[],86.0,1.0,,120405.Fowl_Weather,,,,,85.0,478.0,306,,Algonquin Books,"['135', '150', '122', '49', '22']",,,[],,
Bob Woodward,Shadow,Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,,History,"A New York Times Notable Book of the Year Twenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Ford declared. But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive.

Bob Woodward,Plan of Attack,,,Political Science,"Plan of Attack is the definitive account of how and why President George W. Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam. Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, Plan of Attack is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization. What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin.

BobHenderson,The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,,English,,"Behold the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), today’s fastest growing carbohydrate-based religion. According to church founder Bobby Henderson, the universe and all life within it were created by a mystical and divine being: the Flying Spaghetti Monster. What drives the FSM’s devout followers, a.k.a. Pastafarians? Some say it’s the assuring touch from the FSM’s “noodly appendage.” Then there are those who love the worship service, which is conducted in pirate talk and attended by congregants in dashing buccaneer garb. Still others are drawn to the Church’s flimsy moral standards, religious holidays every Friday, or the fact that Pastafarian heaven is way cooler: Does your heaven have a Stripper Factory and a Beer Volcano? Intelligent Design has finally met its match–and it has nothing to do with apes or the Olive Garden of Eden.Within these pages, Bobby Henderson outlines the true facts– dispelling such malicious myths as evolution (“only a theory”), science (“only a lot of theories”), and whether we’re really descended from apes (fact: Humans share 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, but they share 99.9 percent with pirates!)See what impressively credentialed top scientists have to say:“If Intelligent Design is taught in schools, equal time should be given to the FSM theory and the non-FSM theory.”–Professor Douglas Shaw, Ph.D.“Do not be hypocritical.

Bobbie Owen-Simonson,The Rage Plague,,English,,"In the winter of 2017 visions were seen by Navajo medicine men that what seemed to be the dead would walk for a time, taking peace from the earth. A warning was given to band with other tribes and prepare; the great enemy was coming and would try to hunt down all the peoples of the earth. In the year 2019 the Rage Plague hit and every human on earth was exposed to the virus. Most people got sick as the virus attacked certain lobes of the brain making some people volatile and animal like and others, psychotic blood thirsty lunatics that were hard to kill and cannibalized their victims. These infected peoples were known as Ragers, due to their ballistic tempers and penchant for horrific violence. The enigma of the Rage Plague is that some people got sick and recovered without any damage to the brain and others were completely immune to the virus and just as the Navajo prophesy predicted none of the Southwestern Indian Tribes were infected. This is a story of Rose Williams who is trying to make it to the Navajo Reservation before the plague is totally out of control and John Paul Bluehouse a retired tribal police officer and medicine man trying to lead his people through this dangerous time and secure the reservation.The Rage Plague is an adventure to a land that holds beauty and mystery and of revelation into the human spirit as it is put through the test of incomparable tribulations. It is an experience into mind and soul, of imagery and imagination and a rare look into the Navajo people and customs.This short story is a risk worth taking, so take it… and come out gratified!",,,,November 20th 2013,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B00GMB7KI6,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385473754l/18964659.jpg,4.0,[],100.0,1.0,,18964659-the-rage-plague,,,,,100.0,8.0,40,,,"['3', '2', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Jde v podstatě o zbeletrizovanou historii dvacátého století – jak se promítala do událostí v nymburském pivovaře, kde byl Hrabalův otec správcem a kde spisovatel prožil podstatnou část dětství. Protagonisty textu jsou opět bratři Francin a Pepin, čtenářům tak dobře známí například z Postřižin, jež ostatně mají v tomto textu původ. Celá knížka je tak trochu autorovým nostalgickým povzdechem nad „koncem starých časů“.

It is the day before her eighteenth Born Remembrance, and she is hunting, though many people refuse to eat animal flesh, tainted by radiation during the Time of Sorrows. What Selah's really after are Landers, mysterious people from a land across the big water who survive the delirium-inducing passage in small boats that occasionally crash against the shoreline. She knows she should leave the capture to the men, but Landers bring a good price from the Company and are especially prized if they keep the markings they arrive with.Everything falls to pieces when the Lander Selah catches is stolen by her brothers--and Selah wakes up the next morning to find the Lander's distinctive mark has suddenly appeared on her own flesh. Once the hunter, Selah is now one of the hunted, and she knows only one person who can help her--Bohdi Locke, the Lander her brothers hope to sell.With evocative descriptions of a strange new world that combines elements of scientific advances, political intrigue, and wilderness survival, Bonnie S.

After writing The Fire Eternal Chris d'Lacey is now working on his new story, Dark Fire. Five years have passed since David Rain disappeared mysteriously in the Arctic. Slowly the ice is changing; bears are starving; dragons are rising;and the souls of the Inuit dead are haunting the skies.The spirit Gaia, goddess of the Earth, is restless, aching to bring her might down upon these changes. But all living things may suffer if she does. As the weather grows wilder and the ice caps melt, all eyes turn from the north to David's daughter, Alexa. She is the key to stopping it. . . .But can one girl save the world from the forces of evil or will she disappear like her father? The book opens with a short chapter about how the Earth, Gaia, is beginning to get restless, and then goes to explain Zanna's sadness about David being gone. She gives the invisible and shapeless dragon G'lant, which David gave to at the end of Fire Star, to her daughter Alexa. Since David's apparent death, Zanna has been trying to get back on her feet. She bought a New Age shop called the Healing Touch and is living with the Pennykettles in David's old room. While Zanna is at her shop one night, Lucy sneaks into her room, and steals a letter that Zanna wrote to David.

Desiree is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmonde, who are wealthy Creoles in Louisiana. As a baby, she was discovered by Monsieur Valmonde lying in the shadow of a stone pillar near the Valmonde gateway. She is courted by another wealthy scion of a Creole family, Armand. They appear very devoted to one another and eventually have a child. The people who see the baby get a sense that something is unusual about it. Eventually they realize that the baby's skin is the same color as the quadroon (one-quarter African) nursemaid - the baby is not white. At the time of the story, this would have been considered a terrible taint. Because of Desirees unknown origins, Armand immediately assumes that she is part Black, and after Madame Valmonde suggests that Desiree and the baby return to the Valmonde estate, Armand tells her to leave. Desiree then takes the child and walks off into a bayou where she is never seen again. Armand then proceeds to burn all of Desirees belongings and the childs cradle, as well as all of the letters that she had sent him during their courtship. With this bundle of letters is also one written from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is in fact the one who is part black. Desiree's race is never definitively determined, although after she is dismissed: ""Moreover no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.""

Excerpt: The Giver is a 1993 soft science fiction novel by Lois Lowry. It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian; therefore, it could be considered anti-utopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness,"" a plan which has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of ""Receiver of Memory,"" the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. When Jonas meets the Giver, he is confused in many ways. The Giver is also able to break some rules, such as turning off the speaker and locking his door. As Jonas receives the memories from the previous receiverthe ""Giver""he discovers the power of knowledge. The people in his community are happy because they don't know of a better life but with the knowledge of what they are missing out on it could create chaos. He faces a dilemma: Should he stay with the community, his family living a shallow life without love, color, sound and knowledge or should he run away to where he can live a full life? Despite controversy and criticism that the book's subject material is inappropriate for young children, The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 5.3 million copies. In Australia, the United States and Canada, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many banned book lists and appeared on the American Library Association's list of the most challenged books of the 1990's....More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=19993",,,,June 21st 2010,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction']",,9781158416752,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348581026l/8707741.jpg,4.49,[],100.0,1.0,,8707741-lois-lowry-giver-series,,,,,98.0,510.0,24,,Books LLC,"['317', '144', '38', '4', '7']",,,[],,

With Irving's companion piece ""Rip Van Winkle,"" ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is among the earliest examples of American fiction still read today. The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane (1858) by John QuidorThe story is set circa 1790 in the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, in a secluded glen called Sleepy Hollow. It tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a sycophantic, lean, lanky, and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who competes with Abraham ""Brom Bones"" Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and sole child of a wealthy farmer, Baltus Van Tassel. As Crane leaves a party he attended at the Van Tassel home on an autumn night, he is pursued by the Headless Horseman, who is supposedly the ghost of a Hessian trooper who had his head shot off by a stray cannonball during ""some nameless battle"" of the American Revolutionary War, and who ""rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head."" Ichabod mysteriously disappears from town, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones, who was ""to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related."" Although the nature of the Headless Horseman is left open to interpretation, the story implies that the Horseman was really Brom Bones in disguise. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was based on a German folktale, set in the Dutch culture of Post-Revolutionary War in New York State.

Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. Today The Magnificent Ambersons is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, ""It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right."" ""The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,"" judged Van Wyck Brooks. ""[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Amber-sons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end.""Booth Tarkington (1869-1946), a prolific writer who achieved overnight success with his first novel, The Gentleman from Indiana (1899), is perhaps best remembered as the author of the popular Penrod adventures and Seventeen (1916). He was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize for the novel Alice Adams (1921).",The Growth Trilogy #2,,10/29/18,November 3rd 2006,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Classic Literature', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'The United States Of America']",,9781406935738,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171925907l/127028.jpg,3.77,['Pulitzer Prize for Novel (1919)'],217.0,4.0,,127028.The_Magnificent_Ambersons,,,,,90.0,10079.0,288,,Hard Press,"['2572', '3835', '2687', '740', '245']",,,"['Indianapolis, Indiana (United States)']",,

Boris Vian,L'Écume des jours,,French,,"Chick, Alise, Chloé et Colin passent leur temps à dire des choses rigolotes, à écouter Duke Ellington et à patiner. Dans ce monde où les pianos sont des mélangeurs à cocktails, la réalité semble ne pas avoir de prise. On se marie à l'église comme on va à la fête foraine et on ignore le travail, qui se réduit à une usine monstrueuse faisant tache sur le paysage. Pied de nez aux conventions romanesques et à la morale commune, L'Écume des jours est un délice verbal et un festin poétique. Jeux de mots, néologismes, décalages incongrus... Vian surenchérit sans cesse, faisant naître comme un vertige chez le lecteur hébété, qui sourit quand il peut. Mais le véritable malaise vient d'ailleurs : ces adolescents éternels à la sensibilité exacerbée constituent des victimes de choix. L'obsession consumériste de Chick, née d'une idolâtrie frénétique pour un certain Jean-Sol Partre, semble vouloir dire que le bonheur ne saurait durer. En effet, l'asphyxie gagne du terrain, et l'on assiste avec effroi au rétrécissement inexorable des appartements. On en veut presque à Vian d'être aussi lucide et de ne pas s'être contenté d'une expérience ludique sur fond de roman d'amour. --Sana Tang-Léopold Wauters",,,03/11/47,February 26th 1997,"['Chloe', 'Colin', 'Alise', 'Chick']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'Roman', 'Fantasy', '20th Century', 'Literature']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332596603l/141828.jpg,3.99,[],3214.0,39.0,,141828.L_cume_des_jours,,,,,90.0,26874.0,351,,Le Livre de Poche,"['10718', '8616', '4861', '1800', '879']",,,['Paris (France)'],,
"Boris Vian, Paul Knobloch (Translator)",Autumn in Peking,,English,,"Boris Vian was a jack of all trades - although unfortunately his name was Boris and ""Boris of all trades"" never took off as a turn of phrase. But nevertheless Vian was a great songwriter, playwright, singer, jazz critic and, of course novelist so it should have been Boris instead of Jack. Vian's 1947 novel Autumn in Peking (L'Automne a Pekin) is perhaps Vian's most slapstick work, with an added amount of despair in its exotic recipe for a violent cocktail drink. The story takes place in the imaginary desert called Exopotamie where all the leading characters take part in the building of a train station with tracks that go nowhere. Houses and buildings are destroyed to build this unnecessary structure - and in Vian's world waste not, make not. In Alistair Rolls' pioneering study of Vian's novels, ""The Flight of the Angels,"" he expresses that Exopotamie is a thinly disguised version of Paris, where after the war the city started changing its previous centuries of architecture to something more modern. Yes, something dull to take the place of what was exciting and mysterious. Vian, in a mixture of great humor and unequal amount of disgust, introduces various 'eccentric' characters in this 'desert' adventure, such as Anne and Angel who are best friends; and Rochelle who is in love and sleeps with Anne, while Angel is madly in love with her. Besides the trio there is also Doctor Mangemanche; the archeologist Athanagore Porphyroginite, his aide, Cuivre; and Pipo - all of them in a locality similar to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, where there is a tinge of darkness and anything is possible, except for happiness.",,,10/28/47,February 29th 2012,['Amadis Dudu'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'France', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Humor', 'Roman', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780966234640,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348225663l/141824.jpg,3.95,[],519.0,6.0,,141824.Autumn_in_Peking,,,,,92.0,2326.0,284,,Tamtam Books,"['805', '831', '498', '154', '38']",,,[],,

"Boris Vian, Vernon Sullivan",I Spit on Your Graves,,English,,"Boris Vian was a novelist, jazz musician, jazz critic, poet, playwright, a friend of Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Raymond Queneau, Jean Cocteau, Louis Malle, Jean Paul Sartre, and numerous others of forties and fifties Parisian cultural society. He was also a French translator of American hard-boiled crime novels. One of his discoveries was an African-American writer by the name of Vernon Sullivan. Vian translated Sullivan's I Spit on Your Graves. The book is about a 'white Negro' who acts out an act of revenge against a small Southern town, in repayment for the death of his brother, who was lynched by an all white mob. Upon its release, I Spit on Your Graves became a bestseller in France, as well as a instruction manual for a copycat killer whose copy of I Spit on Your Graves was found by the murdered body of a prostitute with certain violent passages underlined. A censorship trail also came up where Sullivan as the author was held responsible for the material. It was later disclosed that Vian himself wrote the book and made up the identity of Vernon Sullivan! This edition is a translation by Vian, that was never published in America. I Spit on Your Graves is an extremely violent sexy hard-boiled novel about racial and class prejudice, revenge, justice, and is itself a literary oddity due to the fact that it was written by a jazz-loving white Frenchman, who had never been to America.",Vernon Sullivan #1,,11/21/46,October 31st 2013,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Crime', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Noir', 'Literature', '20th Century']",,9780966234602,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348220009l/766860.jpg,3.6,[],249.0,3.0,,766860.I_Spit_on_Your_Graves,,,,,86.0,8329.0,177,,Tamtam Books,"['1852', '2916', '2366', '795', '400']",,,['United States of America'],,

Renowned tech investor and start-up guru Brad Feld lights YOU on fire with this insider's book that will teach you how to launch, fund and run your own company. If you're already an entrepreneur or have always dreamed of being one, douse yourself in “Feld Thoughts” and catch the spark. You'll be burning, entrepreneur, with this e-book!.  Brad's blog is a backstage pass to the 24/7 rock show that is tech startups. It is a master class in startup investing for givers and takers of funds. It is a rolling critique of tech products vast and simple (with enough edge to make the most scathing restaurant critic in Manhattan blush). And it is the journal of a peripatetic marathoner who still believes he will crack the four-hour mark someday.  From such Feld Thoughts, we have constructed “The Burning Entrepreneur,” the e-book on startups that you would take to a desert island if it had electricity, a decent Internet connection and angel investors. “The Burning Entrepreneur” illuminates the actions and attitudes required to launch, fund and ignite your startup. Brad Feld is on fire. Find out what happens when you stand too close.

I’m constantly pushing, looking for the edge of whatever I do. (pg 14)  Over time, I’ve learned that none of the short-term moves in the stock market matter at all in my life. It’s occasionally entertaining to turn on CNBC and see my friend Paul Kedrosky in the octobox telling all the other people that they don’t actually understand macro-economics, but it’s no different than watching McEnroe when he’s announcing a Nadal–Federer match. It’s just sport. (pg 33)  I don’t create products anymore (I invest in companies that create them), but I’m a great alpha tester. I’ve always been good at this for some reason — bugs just find me. While my UX design skills are merely adequate, I’ve got a great feel for how to simplify things and make them cleaner. (pg 58)  If you are someone who spends 30 minutes or more a day “organizing yourself,” I encourage you to step back and think about what you could change and how that might shift you from focusing on organizing to working toward outcomes. It’s liberating.

A strange sense stole over me, as though Bland and I were two actors on stage, our movements spotlighted, black emptiness between us. But that darkness grew smaller as the space between us shrank. I did not know if this sense was due to my immersion in Bland’s face and mind and world, or to my fear of his threatening presence. Or both . . . The nerves between my shoulder blades began to tingle. Help me, God. Please. For twenty years, a killer has eluded capture for a brutal double murder. Now, forensic artist Annie Kingston has agreed to draw the updated face of Bill Bland for the popular television show American Fugitive. To do so, Annie must immerse herself in Bland’s traits and personality. A single habitual expression could alter the way his face has aged. But as she descends into his criminal mind and world, someone is determined to stop her. At any cost. Annie’s one hope is to complete the drawing and pray it leads authorities to Bland—before Bland can get to her.

She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow.

So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.

Similar to the Bible, its sermons and explications of religious principles are presented against the framework of the story of a people. It is a story that covers a thousand years. In this book Brant Gardner looks around and behind the religious purposes of the book and teases out how those thousand years of Book of Mormon history correspond to those same years in the geographic and cultural context where they most plausibly took place.Gardner works through the Book of Mormon chronologically, examining how events in the Book of Mormon reflect the greater historical and cultural developments happening around them at the same time. Gardner asks and answers questions against particular historical backdrops. Why does Nephi appear to be so Christian so long before Christ, and why does his particular time period in Jerusalem help answer that question? Why do Nephi apostate groups from different times appear to adopt the same religion? Why does the Book of Mormon end around A.D. 400? Why not earlier or later? The answers are developed by looking at the Book of Mormon as history in the context of what has become known of Mesoamerican history.

Brant Hansen,Unoffendable: How Just One Change Can Make All of Life Better,,English,,"
  Not entitled to get angry? Really?
 It’s a radical, provocative idea: We’re not entitled to get offended or stay angry. The idea of our own “righteous anger” is a myth. It is the number one problem in our societies today and, as Dallas Willard says, Christians have not been taught out of it. As it turns out, giving up our “right” to be offended can be one of the most freeing, healthy, simplifying, relaxing, refreshing, stress-relieving, encouraging things we can do. In Unoffendable readers will find something of immeasurable value—a concrete, practical way to live life with less stress. They’ll adjust their expectations to fit human nature and replace perpetual anger with refreshing humility and gratitude. The book offers a unique viewpoint, challenging the idea that Christians can ever harbor “righteous anger” or that there evenis such a thing for believers. Few other books exist with such a radical, provocative proposal to consider. We have no right to anger. We are to get rid of it, period. Completely. And it is possible to choose to be “unoffendable.” Through the author’s winsome, humorous, and conversational style, this book doesn’t add another thing to do on a stressed-out person’s ever-growing list. Better, it actually seeks to lift religious burdens from readers’ backs and allow them to experience the joy of gratitude, perhaps for the first time, every single day of their lives.",,,04/01/15,April 14th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Self Help', 'Faith', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development']",,9780529123855,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440727387l/24648636._SY475_.jpg,4.47,[],100.0,1.0,,24648636-unoffendable,,,,,98.0,3114.0,198,,Thomas Nelson,"['1904', '865', '272', '51', '22']",,,[],,
"Brant Pitre, Scott Hahn (Preface)",Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist: Unlocking the Secrets of the Last Supper,,English,,"A revelatory exploration of the Jewish roots of the Last Supper that seeks to understand exactly what happened at Jesus' final Passover.   ""Clear, profound and practical--you do not want to miss this book.""--Dr. Scott Hahn, author of The Lamb's Supper and The Fourth CupJesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist shines fresh light on the Last Supper by looking at it through Jewish eyes. Using his in-depth knowledge of the Bible and ancient Judaism, Dr. Brant Pitre answers questions such as: What was the Passover like at the time of Jesus? What were the Jewish hopes for the Messiah? What was Jesus' purpose in instituting the Eucharist during the feast of Passover? And, most important of all, what did Jesus mean when he said, ""This is my body... This is my blood""?To answer these questions, Pitre explores ancient Jewish beliefs about the Passover of the Messiah, the miraculous Manna from heaven, and the mysterious Bread of the Presence. As he shows, these three keys--the Passover, the Manna, and the Bread of the Presence--have the power to unlock the original meaning of the Eucharistic words of Jesus. Along the way, Pitre also explains how Jesus united the Last Supper to his death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday.Inspiring and informative, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist is a groundbreaking work that is sure to illuminate one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith: the mystery of Jesus' presence in ""the breaking of the bread.""",,,10/30/11,February 15th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Catholic', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Faith', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Judaism', 'Spirituality']",,9780385531849,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395436683l/8427566.jpg,4.58,[],95.0,1.0,,8427566-jesus-and-the-jewish-roots-of-the-eucharist,,,,,98.0,1828.0,228,,Image,"['1251', '425', '124', '20', '8']",,,[],,
"Brassaï, Timothy Bent (Translator)",Henry Miller: The Paris Years,,English,,"Miller didn't just inhabit Paris, he devoured it. Not the Paris of the guidebooks, but the City of Light's lurid backways and backwaters, the dens of vice where he could slough off the pale cast of American puritanism and embrace the hedonistic facts of life. The Parisian life of Miller was a turbulent quest for new sensations and avenues, a roisterous, slumming exploration of the soul. This world Miller shared with Brassai, one of the greatest photographers of our century. Miller and Brassai's friendship was a recognition of kindred spirits, born of mutual admiration for each other's tireless, restless fascination with Paris and its inhabitants. In Miller, Brassai found his most compelling subject. Using unpublished letters, recollected conversations, and references to Miller's workand featuring sixteen unforgettable examples of Brassai's photography""Henry Miller: The Paris Years"" is an intimate account of a writer's self-discovery, seen through the unblinking eye of a master photographer. Brassai delves into Miller's relationships with Anais Nin and Lawrence Durrell, as well as his hopelessly tangled though wildly inspiring marriage to June. Brassai remembers Miller's favorite cafes and haunts, revives Miller's idols and anathemas, and evokes their shared passion for the street life of a Montparnasse and Montmartre captured, even during those depression years, in a dazzling moment of illumination.",,,11/05/75,August 1st 2007,[],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'France', '20th Century']",,9781559703475,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348005316l/84036.jpg,4.14,[],94.0,1.0,,84036.Henry_Miller,,,,,97.0,344.0,240,,Arcade Publishing,"['133', '137', '65', '8', '1']",,,[],,

Welcome to ""The Hunger But Mainly Death Games,"" the hilarious Hunger Games parody, and the only book brave enough to suggest that Suzanne Collins's epic trilogy was way more about death than food.Or at least this is what Bratniss Everclean discovers, when she leaves the comforts of Slum 12, Pandumb’s garbage dump, to shortsightedly volunteer for a teenage death tournament. But she soon realizes there are fates worse than death…like weirdly having to date her fellow competitor, and lifelong stalker, Pita Malarkey. Okay, okay, it’s not worse than DEATH, but it’s still pretty annoying.Still, with help from her agent Oofie Triptrip and her mentor, Hagridmitch, who’s pretty sure he can guide Bratniss to victory in the Tri-Wizard Cup, maybe Bratniss will somehow survive this book that she’s the narrator of. “The Hunger But Mainly Death Games” is the perfect book for anyone who’s going through Hunger Games withdrawal and ready for a wonderfully twisted take on their favorite story and characters.

By exploring concepts like good versus evil or the effects of magic on society, we can understand something of ourselves and the human experience--with the added benefit of adventures and epic quests to save the world.

"Brent Schlender (Goodreads Author), Rick Tetzeli",Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader,,English,,"
  The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history.  
  
 Becoming Steve Jobs breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people? Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world. A rich and revealing account, Becoming Steve Jobs shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.",,,,March 24th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Leadership', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Apple', 'Entrepreneurship']",,9780385347402,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440109909l/24386240._SX318_.jpg,4.15,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science & Technology (2015)'],99.0,1.0,,24386240-becoming-steve-jobs,,,,,93.0,14453.0,482,,Crown Business,"['6537', '5010', '1911', '562', '433']",,,[],,

Brené Brown (Goodreads Author),Dare to Lead,,English,,"In her #1 NYT bestsellers, Brené Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection and courage to start.Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?Dare to Lead answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.Brené writes, ‘One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work.

Brené Brown (Goodreads Author),"Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead",,English,,"Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection.

Brené Brown (Goodreads Author),The Gifts of Imperfection,,English,,"New York Times best-selling author and professor Brené Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave.

Brené Brown (Goodreads Author),"The Power of Vulnerability: Teachings of Authenticity, Connections and Courage",,English,,"Show Up and Let Yourself be Seen Is vulnerability the same as weakness? “In our culture,” teaches Dr. Brené Brown, “we associate vulnerability with emotions we want to avoid such as fear, shame, and uncertainty. Yet we too often lose sight of the fact that vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, belonging, creativity, authenticity, and love.” On The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brown offers an invitation and a promise - that when we dare to drop the armor that protects us from feeling vulnerable, we open ourselves to the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Here she dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and reveals that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.“The Power of Vulnerability is a very personal project for me,” Brené explains. “This is the first place that all of my work comes together. This audio course draws from all three of my books - it’s the culmination of everything I’ve learned over the past twelve years. I'm very excited to weave it all into a truly comprehensive form that shows what these findings and insights can mean in our lives.”Guidance and Insights for Wholehearted LivingOver the past twelve years, Dr. Brené Brown has interviewed hundreds of people as part of an ongoing study of vulnerability. “The research shows that we try to ward disappointment with a shield of cynicism, disarm shame by numbing ourselves against joy, and circumvent grief by shutting off our willingness to love,” explains Dr. Brown. When we become aware of these patterns, she teaches, we begin to become conscious of how much we sacrifice in the name of self-defense -and how much richer our lives become when we open ourselves to vulnerability.“In my research,” Dr. Brown says, “the word I use to describe people who can live from a place of vulnerability is wholehearted.” Being wholehearted is a practice—one that we can choose to cultivate through empathy, gratitude, and awareness of our vulnerability armor.

Bret Easton Ellis,Imperial Bedrooms,,English,,"Twenty-five years on from ""Less Than Zero"", we pick up again with ""Clay"". In 1985, Bret Easton Ellis shocked, stunned and disturbed with ""Less Than Zero"", his 'extraordinarily accomplished first novel' (""New Yorker""), successfully chronicling the frightening consequences of unmitigated hedonism within the ranks of the ethically bereft youth of 80s Los Angeles. Now, twenty-five years later, Ellis returns to those same characters: to Clay and the band of infamous teenagers whose lives weave sporadically through his. But now, some years on, they face an even greater period of disaffection: their own middle age. Clay seems to have moved on - he's become a successful screenwriter - but when he returns from New York to Los Angeles, to help cast his new movie, he's soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is now married to Trent, and their Beverly Hills parties attract excessive levels of fame and fortune, though for all that Trent is a powerful manager, his baser instincts remain: he's still a bisexual philanderer. Then there's Clay's childhood friend, Julian - who's now a recovering addict - and their old dealer, Rip - face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than he was in his notorious past. Clay, too, struggles with his own demons after a meeting with a gorgeous actress determined to win a role in his movie. And with his life careening out of control, he's forced to come to terms with the deepest recesses of his character - and with his seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal.",,,,June 15th 2010,"['Clay (Less Than Zero)', 'Blair (Less Than Zero)', 'Julian (Less Than Zero)', 'Rip (Less Than Zero)', 'Trent (Less Than Zero)']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'American', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Literature', 'Horror', 'Adult', 'Urban']",,9780330517096,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1278878105l/7519866.jpg,3.15,[],1038.0,12.0,,7519866-imperial-bedrooms,,,,,72.0,20062.0,256,,Picador,"['2805', '4908', '6668', '3759', '1922']",,,"['Los Angeles, California (United States)']",,
Bret Easton Ellis,Glamorama,,English,,"The author of American Psycho and Less Than Zero continues to shock and haunt us with his incisive and brilliant dissection of the modern world.In his most ambitious and gripping book yet, Bret Easton Ellis takes our celebrity obsessed culture and increases the volume exponentially. Set in 90s Manhattan, Victor Ward, a model with perfect abs and all the right friends, is seen and photographed everywhere, even in places he hasn't been and with people he doesn't know. He's living with one beautiful model and having an affair with another onthe eve of opening the trendiest nightclub in New York City history.And now it's time to move to the next stage. But the future he gets is not the one he had in mind. With the same deft satire and savage wit he has brought to his other fiction, Bret Ellis gets beyond the facade and introduces us, unsparingly, to what we always feared was behind it.

Bret Hart,Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling,,English,,"In his own words, Bret Hart’s honest, perceptive, startling account of his life in and out of the pro wrestling ring.The sixth-born son of the pro wrestling dynasty founded by Stu Hart and his elegant wife, Helen, Bret Hart is a Canadian icon. As a teenager, he could have been an amateur wrestling Olympic contender, but instead he turned to the family business, climbing into the ring for his dad’s western circuit, Stampede Wrestling. From his early twenties until he retired at 43, Hart kept an audio diary, recording stories of the wrestling life, the relentless travel, the practical jokes, the sex and drugs, and the real rivalries (as opposed to the staged ones). The result is an intimate, no-holds-barred account that will keep readers, not just wrestling fans, riveted.Hart achieved superstardom in pink tights, and won multiple wrestling belts in multiple territories, for both the WWF (now the WWE) and WCW. But he also paid the price in betrayals (most famously by Vince McMahon, a man he had served loyally); in tragic deaths, including the loss of his brother Owen, who died when a stunt went terribly wrong; and in his own massive stroke, most likely resulting from a concussion he received in the ring, and from which, with the spirit of a true champion, he has battled back.Widely considered by his peers as one of the business’s best technicians and workers, Hart describes pro wrestling as part dancing, part acting, and part dangerous physical pursuit. He is proud that in all his years in the ring he never seriously hurt a single wrestler, yet did his utmost to deliver to his fans an experience as credible as it was exciting. He also records the incredible toll the business takes on its workhorses: he estimates that twenty or more of the wrestlers he was regularly matched with have died young, weakened by their own coping mechanisms, namely drugs, alcohol, and steroids. That toll included his own brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith. No one has ever written about wrestling like Bret Hart. No one has ever lived a life like Bret Hart’s.For as long as I can remember, my world was filled with liars and bullshitters, losers and pretenders, but I also saw the good side of pro wrestling. To me there is something bordering on beautiful about a brotherhood of big tough men who pretended to hurt one another for a living instead of actually doing it. Any idiot can hurt someone.—from Hitman",,,01/01/07,October 16th 2007,"['Bret Hart', 'Owen Hart', 'Bruce Hart', 'Tom ""Dynamite Kid"" Billington', 'Stu Hart']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Sports', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Canada', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'History']",,9780307355669,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387734768l/1110968.jpg,4.37,[],111.0,2.0,,1110968.Hitman,,,,,98.0,4679.0,569,,Grand Central Publishing,"['2481', '1554', '537', '94', '13']",,,[],,

"Brian Cox, Jeffrey R. Forshaw",Why Does E=mc²? (And Why Should We Care?),,English,,"The most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today’s leading scientists.Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up Einstein’s most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine—which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang—Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.Alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed.

Brian D. McLaren,"A Generous Orthodoxy: Why I am a missional, evangelical, post/protestant, liberal/conservative, biblical, charismatic/contemplative, fundamentalist/calvinist, anabaptist/anglican, incarnational, depressed-yet-hopeful, emergent, unfinished Christian",,English,,"Why I am a missional, evangelical, post/protestant, liberal/conservative, mystical/poetic, biblical, charismatic/contemplative, fundamentalist/Calvinist, Anabaptist/Anglican, Methodist, catholic, green, incarnational, depressed- yet hopeful, emergent, unfinished Christian. A confession and manifesto from a senior leader in the emerging church movement. A Generous Orthodoxycalls for a radical, Christ-centered orthodoxy of faith and practice in a missional, generous spirit. Brian McLaren argues for a post-liberal, post-conservative, post-protestant convergence, which will stimulate lively interest and global conversation among thoughtful Christians from all traditions. In a sweeping exploration of belief, author Brian McLaren takes us across the landscape of faith, envisioning an orthodoxy that aims for Jesus, is driven by love, and is defined by missional intent. A Generous Orthodoxy rediscovers the mysterious and compelling ways that Jesus can be embraced across the entire Christian horizon. Rather than establishing what is and is not “orthodox,” McLaren walks through the many traditions of faith, bringing to the center a way of life that draws us closer to Christ and to each other. Whether you find yourself inside, outside, or somewhere on the fringe of Christianity, A Generous Orthodoxy draws you toward a way of living that looks beyond the “us/them” paradigm to the blessed and ancient paradox of “we.” Also available on abridged audio CD, read by the author.",,Abridged,02/01/04,January 29th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Theology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Spirituality', 'Faith', 'Church', 'Christian Living', 'Christian Non Fiction']",,9780310258032,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384949537l/87664.jpg,3.66,[],93.0,2.0,,87664.A_Generous_Orthodoxy,,,,,84.0,5922.0,348,,Zondervan,"['1649', '1981', '1327', '562', '403']",,,[],,
Brian D. McLaren,The Secret Message of Jesus: Uncovering the Truth That Could Change Everything,,English,,"When Brian McLaren began offering an alternative vision of Christian faith and life in books such as ""A New Kind of Christian"" and ""A Generous Orthodoxy, "" he ignited a firestorm of praise and condemnation that continues to spread across the religious landscape. To some religious conservatives, McLaren is a dangerous rebel without a doctrinally-correct cause. Some fundamentalist websites have even claimed he's in league with the devil and have consigned him to flames.To others though, Brian is a fresh voice, a welcome antidote to the staleness, superficiality, and negativity of the religious status quo. A wide array of people from Evangelical, Catholic, and Mainline Protestant backgrounds claim that through his books they have begun to rediscover the faith they'd lost or rejected. And around the world, many readers say that he has helped them find-for the first time in their lives-a faith that makes sense and rings true. For many, he articulates the promise of what is being called ""emerging Christianity.""In ""The Secret Message of Jesus"" you'll find what's at the center of Brian's critique of conventional Christianity, and what's at the heart of his expanding vision. In the process, you'll meet a Jesus who may be altogether new to you, a Jesus who is... Not the crusading conqueror of religious broadcasting; Not the religious mascot of partisan religion; Not heaven's ticket-checker, whose words have been commandeered by the church to include and exclude, judge and stigmatize, pacify and domesticate.McLaren invites you to discover afresh the transforming message of Jesus-an open invitation to radical change, an enlightening revelation that exposes sham and ignites hope, an epic story that is good news for everyone, whatever their gender, race, class, politics, or religion.""Pastor and best-selling author McLaren revisits the gospel material from a fresh-and at times radical-perspective . . . He does an excellent job of capturing Jesus' quiet, revolutionary style.""--""Publishers Weekly"" (starred review)""Here McLaren shares his own ferocious journey in pondering the teachings and actions of Jesus. It is McLaren's lack of salesmanship or agenda that creates a refreshing picture of the man from Galilee who changed history.""--Donald Miller, Author of ""Blue Like Jazz""""In this critical book, Brian challenges us to ask what it would mean to truly live the message of Jesus today, and thus to risk turning everything upside down.""--Jim Wallis, Author of ""God's Politics"" and editor of ""Sojourners""""Compelling, crucial and liberating: a book for those who seek to experience the blessed heat of Christianity at its source.""--Anne Rice, Author of ""Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt""",,,,April 1st 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Faith', 'Philosophy', 'Christian Living', 'History']",,9780849900006,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442117329l/37984._SX318_.jpg,3.77,[],100.0,1.0,,37984.The_Secret_Message_of_Jesus,,,,,88.0,1880.0,237,,W Publishing Group,"['574', '603', '478', '142', '83']",,,[],,

'A must-read' Sunday Times 'Greene takes us to the limits of space and time' Guardian 'Sends the reader's imagination hurtling through the universe on an astonishing ride' The New York Times Brian Greene is well known to many fans as a populariser of theoretical physics. He is the author of the bestselling books about string theory, The Elegant Universe, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction, The Fabric of the Cosmos, and The Hidden Reality. Educated at Harvard and Oxford, he has taught at both Harvard and Cornell and has been Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University since 1996.",,,,2005.0,,,,0141011114,9780141011110,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpSqvJpLe8oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.12,,,,,,,,,,,,592.0,,,,324.0,,,,
Brian Greene,The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,,English,,"From the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos comes his most expansive and accessible book to date—a book that takes on the grandest question: Is ours the only universe?There was a time when “universe” meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of math.Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality’s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And, with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining, Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?Sparked by Greene’s trademark wit and precision, The Hidden Reality is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of reality—a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.",,,01/01/11,January 25th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Philosophy', 'Astronomy', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Unfinished', 'Quantum Mechanics']",,9780307265630,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320431300l/8167094.jpg,4.09,['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee for Science Books (2012)'],52.0,1.0,,8167094-the-hidden-reality,,,,,94.0,16923.0,384,,Knopf,"['6686', '6281', '2995', '638', '323']",,,[],,

Research reveals how over 63 % of these deaths and injuries from the medical system were found to be preventable and over 75 % of the conditions patients were being treated for could be cured without medication or surgery!Dr. Sheen has been a healthcare professional for the past thirty years and has worked with hospitals, Health Departments, schools, wellness task forces and thousands of individuals in communities worldwide. He observed firsthand how the dependency of society upon a money driven sick-care system has caused great harm and dependency upon toxic medications and dangerous medical interventions. In his book he shares how this dependency begins at birth and is systematically impressed upon every person through every stage of life. Is it any wonder those 65 and above fill an average of 15 prescriptions per year, and this number rises with their age!As Dr Sheen shares “After fifty years of involvement in health and wellness, it is clear to me that each person MUST play an active role in maintaining their optimal functioning as a human being, physically, emotionally and mentally. We need to have the most up-to-date information available about our minds and bodies, which we must actively assert to protect our overall health. It is not about trusting or mistrusting the medical establishment, but it is being aware that sick-care is a business with rules and regulations which often prove to be more to their advantage than to ours. We each need to understand the realities of the pressures those in the medical profession have and the near-impossible task of continually staying at the cutting-edge of the many diverse disciplines of medicine, science and technology and become an active and informed participant in maintaining our health and avoiding dangerous medical interventions.”Dr Sheen’s companion book, The Epigenetic Cure; Re-educating Your Cells and DNA for Optimal Health then shares a wide variety of successful non toxic and life sustaining alternative scientific approaches.",,,,May 4th 2020,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B0884LBWG2,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592212844l/54063308._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],4.0,1.0,,54063308-misdiagnosis-and-mistreatment,,,,,,2.0,139,,Quantum Embodiment Publications; 1 edition,[],,,[],,

In his award-winning work on Y THE LAST MAN and EX MACHINA (one of Entertainment Weekly’s 2005 Ten Best Fiction titles), writer Brian K. Vaughan has displayed an understanding of both the cost of survival and the political nuances of the modern world. Now, in this provocative graphic novel, Vaughan examines life on the streets of war-torn Iraq. In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation – can it be given or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity?

It was a testing ground to find minds and souls for the The Nameless God to use, and for tens of thousands of players, the game became reality, when they were put in the bodies of their characters. The Nameless God told them that he would return them to their real lives, if they fought through the Labyrinth of Yggr and freed his body from beneath the city of Haven. After searching for over 11 years, they found the Gate leading to Haven.After being murdered right before the gate to Haven was opened, Mark McGuinness wakes up in a hospital in his original body. As a child, he was in an automobile accident. A freak whose body rejects most medical treatments, he was left scarred and disfigured. Angry, bitter and disgusted with the world, he had used Taereun: Battleground of the Damned to take out his frustration and anger, so he would not lose control and hurt or kill someone in real life. The closest he had ever come to being happy was living as Talon, during the eleven year search for Haven.Having learned about the Power called ki, Mark McGuinness discovers that his human body is capable of channeling and using it. Once again armed with Power, he finds a way to travel from Earth to Taereun. He has questions he wants answered and people he owes.

Brian O'Hare (Goodreads Author),The Dark Web Murders,,English,,"I AM MEMEIN. I AM EMOTIONALLY DETACHED FROM MY KILLINGS. I AM NOT, THEREFORE, A MURDERER. I AM AN INSTRUMENT OF NEMESIS, A PUNISHER.    This is a theme running through a number of blogs on the Dark Web, written by a serial killer. He is highly intelligent and employs philosophical argument to justify a series of gruesome murders.  However, he describes the killings in lurid detail, and with such gloating relish, that he utterly negates his delusion of detachment and reveals himself to be a cold-blooded, narcissistic psychopath.  Sheehan and his team rush headlong down a series of blind alleys in the pursuit of the psychopath, who continues to murder his victims with impunity. He is fiendishly clever, utterly ruthless, and tests Sheehan's famed intuition to the limit.  Indeed, Sheehan only learns the truth during a horrific climax when some members of his team experience a most harrowing ‘laceration of the soul’ that they will never be able to forget. It is unlikely that the reader will either.   ""The first thing I thought after reading this book is: Why isn't Brian O'Hare better known in the crime writing world?

Brian S. Pratt,The Unsuspecting Mage,,English,,"“Want to be a mage? Then do we have the job for you…”Sounds great for a veteran role-player. When on-the-job training entails battling demons, learning magic through trial and error, and living in a world without toilet paper, things could get rough. But to be dropped in the middle of a forest and having to do it on your own with no instruction…welcome to James’ world.It all gets started when his grandfather suggests to James, a young man on the verge of graduating high school, that he check out the following advertisement for a job. “Magic! Real Magic! Ever wanted to learn? We require someone with intelligence and a disciplined mind. Those well versed in fantasy novels and role playing games a plus. May need to travel.”Sounded like the perfect job for a veteran role-player and avid fantasy reader. James had no idea he’d be whisked to another world, completely cut off from friends and family. Arriving in a meadow in the middle of a forest, he’s greeted by a creature not entirely human. He was then told three things:Magic works here…Don’t try to go home…Get to the village of Trendle…Then the creature vanished.Which way was Trendle? Where was he? What might inhabit the forest that will seek his ruination? These were but a few of the questions needing to be unraveled. Alone with only his wits and knowledge gleaned from hundreds of books and dungeon campaigns, he started out just trying to survive. He soon learned that one mistake, one lapse in judgment could mean his death. Not long after arriving, he made the acquaintance of Miko, a street-wise kid who quickly became his friend and companion. Little did he know that the strength within this child from the streets of Bearn, a strength that would be tested again and again as they waded through battle after battle, delved in hidden passages deep beneath the earth, and faced off against an the might of an Empire, would be invaluable in the trials ahead.The Unsuspecting Mage is the first book of The Morcyth Saga, a seven book epic fantasy adventure. It follows James as he seeks first to master the art of magic then to uncover the reason why he had been brought to this strange new world where armies are on the move and gods meddle in the affairs of men.

Hailed by critics worldwide, part one of the movie trilogy was a box-office smash, one of the most successful films of the decade. Peter Jackson's ""fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale,"" wrote Newsweek. ""In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale,"" wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the ""grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth"" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. Including more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley's fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it's all here.""It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull.

Brigid Pasulka (Goodreads Author),"A Long, Long Time Ago and Essentially True",,English,,"On the eve of World War II, in a place called Half-Village, a young man nicknamed the Pigeon falls in love with a girl fabled for her angelic looks. To court Anielica Hetmanská he offers up his ""golden hands"" to transform her family’s modest hut into a beautiful home, thereby building his way into her heart. Then war arrives to cut short their courtship, delay their marriage, and wreak havoc in all their lives, even sending the young lovers far from home to the promise of a new life in Kraków. Nearly fifty years later, their granddaughter, Beata, repeats their postwar journey, seeking a new life in the fairy-tale city of her grandmother’s stories. But when she arrives in Kraków, instead of the whispered prosperity of the New Poland, she discovers a city caught between its future and its past, and full of frustrated youths. Taken in by her toughtalking cousin Irena and Irena’s glamorous daughter Magda, Beata struggles to find her own place in 1990s Kraków and in the constellation of Irena and Magda’s fierce love. But unexpected events-- tragedies and miracles-- can change lives and open eyes. And Beata may just find a new way of seeing her family's and her country's history-- as well as a vision for her own role in the New Poland.

Brigid Schulte (Goodreads Author),"Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time",,English,,"Overwhelmed is a book about time pressure and modern life. It is a deeply reported and researched, honest and often hilarious journey from feeling that, as one character in the book said, time is like a ""rabid lunatic"" running naked and screaming as your life flies past you, to understanding the historical and cultural roots of the overwhelm, how worrying about all there is to do and the pressure of feeling like we're never have enough time to do it all, or do it well, is ""contaminating"" our experience of time, how time pressure and stress is resculpting our brains and shaping our workplaces, our relationships and squeezing the space that the Greeks said was the point of living a Good Life: that elusive moment of peace called leisure.Author Brigid Schulte, an award-winning journalist for the Washington Post - and harried mother of two - began the journey quite by accident, after a time-use researcher insisted that she, like all American women, had 30 hours of leisure each week. Stunned, she accepted his challenge to keep a time diary and began a journey that would take her from the depths of what she described as the Time Confetti of her days to a conference in Paris with time researchers from around the world, to North Dakota, of all places, where academics are studying the modern love affair with busyness, to Yale, where neuroscientists are finding that feeling overwhelmed is actually shrinking our brains, to exploring new lawsuits uncovering unconscious bias in the workplace, why the US has no real family policy, and where states and cities are filling the federal vacuum.She spent time with mothers drawn to increasingly super intensive parenting standards, and mothers seeking to pull away from it. And she visited the walnut farm of the world's most eminent motherhood researcher, an evolutionary anthropologist, to ask, are mothers just ""naturally"" meant to be the primary parent? The answer will surprise you.Along the way, she was driven by two questions, Why are things the way they are? and, How can they be better? She found real world bright spots of innovative workplaces, couples seeking to shift and share the division of labor at home and work more equitably and traveled to Denmark, the happiest country on earth, where fathers - and mothers - have more pure leisure time than parents in other industrial countries. She devoured research about the science of play, why it's what makes us human, and the feminist leisure research that explains why it's so hard for women to allow themselves to. The answers she found are illuminating, perplexing and ultimately hopeful. The book both outlines the structural and policy changes needed - already underway in small pockets - and mines the latest human performance and motivation science to show the way out of the overwhelm and toward a state that time use researchers call ...

It begins with a secret.""All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.""It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance—and the subsequent cover-up—will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt.In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a ""what if"" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever.",,,,October 11th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'African American', 'Novels', 'Coming Of Age', 'Family']",,9780399184512,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1460652458l/28815371.jpg,3.86,"['New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award Nominee (2017)', 'PEN/Robert W.

Brit Bennett (Goodreads Author),The Vanishing Half,,English,,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERLONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD A GOOD MORNING AMERICA Book Club Pick From The New York Times-bestselling author of The Mothers, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one black and one white. The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.As with her New York Times-bestselling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing page-turner about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate and wise.",,,,June 2nd 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Race', 'Adult Fiction', 'Historical', 'Novels']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577090827l/51791252._SX318_SY475_.jpg,4.3,[],85.0,1.0,,51791252-the-vanishing-half,,,,,98.0,131732.0,343,,Riverhead Books,"['59805', '54926', '14668', '1803', '530']",,,[],,

Haunted by her failures, country police officer Detective Isabelle O'Connell is recalled to duty by Detective Alec Goddard to investigate the abduction of yet another child from her old home town.With the killer playing a game of cat and mouse and targeting Bella, they have only days in which to find the girl alive, but they have very few clues, a whole town of suspects, and a vast wilderness to search. For Bella, this case is already personal; for Alec his best intentions to keep it purely professional soon dissolve. He starts to think of the missing child as if she were his own, and his anguish over Bella’s safety moves beyond the just his concern for a colleague. Their mutual attraction leaves them both vulnerable to their private nightmares – nightmares that the killer ruthlessly exploits.For more information on Bronwyn Parry’s debut novel, AS DARKNESS FALLS, please visit the website: www.asdarknessfalls.com.au ",Dungirri #1,,11/06/08,September 1st 2008,"[""Isabelle O'Connell"", 'Alec Goddard']",Trade paperback,"['Romantic Suspense', 'Romance', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Australia', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary']",,9780733623226,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1222832274l/3750342.jpg,4.1,"['Golden Heart by Romance Writers of America for Best Romantic Suspense Manuscript (""Falling into Darkness"" by Bronwyn Clarke) (2007)']",83.0,1.0,,3750342-as-darkness-falls,,,,,95.0,575.0,352,,Hachette Australia,"['236', '199', '109', '21', '10']",,,['Australia'],,

Serving up Nibble My Nuts sundaes and Drunken Sailor boozy shakes are as close to an orgasmic affair as she's had in months thanks to her expanding empire—until the night of her ten-year high school reunion.  When Ryleigh's crush, gorgeous ex-football god Cameron Mathis, comes streaking into her life (literally—streaking), she begins to wonder if she really can have it all.

He comes face-to-face with his doubts in the person of Danny Butler, a mid-level drug runner Miller hopes to use to catch a much larger fish: Roberto Hinestroza, a drug lord Miller has pursued for years. Danny has no interest in being a witness against his boss, both out of a sense of twisted loyalty and because he knows double-crossing Hinestroza is a sure death sentence. But he reluctantly agrees to cooperate, and as he suspects, it doesn't take long for Hinestroza to figure out the betrayal. Miller is surprised to discover Danny's not the career-criminal lowlife he expected; at the same time, Danny finds himself helplessly attracted to Miller's innate goodness.

We must merely open our hearts to receive Him and His loving presence. As a humble cook, Brother Lawrence learned an important lesson through each daily chore: The time he spent in communion with the Lord should be the same, whether he was bustling around in the kitchen—with several people asking questions at the same time—or on his knees in prayer. He learned to cultivate the deep presence of God so thoroughly in his own heart that he was able to joyfully exclaim, “I am doing now what I will do for all eternity.

Do you reveal pivotal plot points like the one at the end of the book where the little girl on crutches points an accusing finger and shouts, ""The killer is Mr. Potter""?I have too much respect for you as an attention-deficient consumer to attempt such an obvious ruse. But let's not play games here. You picked up the book already, so you either: A. Know who I am B. Liked the cool smoking jacket I'm wearing on the coverC. Have just discovered that the bookstore restroom is out of toilet paper Is it a sequel to my autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor? Sadly, no, which made it much harder to write. According to my publisher, I haven't ""done"" enough since 2001 to warrant another memoir. Is it an ""autobiographical novel""? Yes. I'm the lead character in the story, and I'm a real person, and everything in the book actually happened, except for the stuff that didn't. The action revolves around my preparations for a pivotal role in the A-list relationship film Let's Make Love! But my Homeric attempt to break through the glass ceiling of B-grade genre fare is hampered by a vengeful studio executive and a production that becomes infected by something called the ""B movie virus,"" symptoms of which include excessive use of cheesy special effects, slapstick, and projectile vomiting. From a violent fistfight with a Buddhist to a life-altering stint in federal prison, this novel has it all. And if the 72,444 words are too time-consuming, there are lots and lots of cool graphics.Regards, Bruce ""Don't Call Me Ash"" CampbellPraise for Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way""It's a great, goofy what-if.""---Entertainment Weekly""Ultimately, Make Love is a Bruce Campbell novel, starring Bruce Campbell, written for Bruce Campbell fans for whom Bruce Campbell can do no wrong. They'll no doubt find Campbell's latest endeavor nothing short of---to quote one of his most famous characters---groovy.""---The Onion""One of the most delightfully deranged experiences you'll have reading this year.

Bruce Chatwin,The Songlines,,English,,"In this extraordinary book, Bruce Chatwin has adapted a literary form common until the eighteenth century though rare in ours; a story of ideas in which two companions, traveling and talking together, explore the hopes and dreams that animate both them and the people they encounter. Set in almost uninhabitable regions of Central Australia, The Songlines asks and tries to answer these questions: Why is man the most restless, dissatisfied of animals? Why do wandering people conceive the world as perfect whereas sedentary ones always try to change it? Why have the great teachers—Christ or the Buddha—recommended the Road as the way. to salvation? Do we agree with Pascal that all man's troubles stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room?We do not often ask these questions today for we commonly assume that living in a house is normal and that the wandering life is aberrant. But for more than twenty years Chatwin has mulled over the possibility that the reverse might be the case.Pre-colonial Australia was the last landmass on earth peopled not by herdsmen, farmers, or city dwellers, but by hunter-gatherers. Their labyrinths of invisible pathways across the continent are known to us as Songlines or Dreaming Tracks, but to the Aboriginals as the tracks of their ancestors—the Way of the Law. Along these ""roads"" they travel in order to perform all those activities that are distinctively human—song, dance, marriage, exchange of ideas, and arrangements of territorial boundaries by agreement rather than force.In Chatwin's search for the Songlines, Arkady is an ideal friend and guide: Australian by birth, the son of a Cossack exile, with all the strength and warmth of his inheritance. Whether hunting kangaroo from a Land Cruiser, talking to the diminutive Rolf in his book-crammed trailer, buying drinks for a bigoted policeman (and would-be writer), cheering as Arkady's true love declares herself (part of The Songlines is a romantic comedy), Chatwin turns this almost implausible picaresque adventure into something approaching the scale of a Greek tragedy.The life of the Aboriginals stands in vivid contrast, of course, to the prevailing cultures of our time. And The Songlines presents unforgettable details about the kinds of disputes we know all too well from less traumatic confrontations: over sacred lands invaded by railroads, mines, and construction sites, over the laws and rights of a poor people versus a wealthy invasive one. To Chatwin these are but recent, local examples of an eternal basic distinction between settlers and wanderers. His book, devoted to the latter, is a brilliant evocation of this profound optimism: that man is by nature not a bellicose aggressor but a pacific, song-creating, adaptive species whose destiny is to quest for the truth.",,,10/28/87,June 1st 1988,[],Paperback,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Australia', 'History', 'Anthropology', 'Memoir', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'Philosophy']",,9780140094299,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388186150l/76844.jpg,3.98,"[""Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book in South Asia and Europe (1988)""]",322.0,3.0,,76844.The_Songlines,,,,,93.0,9317.0,304,,Penguin,"['3235', '3467', '1941', '522', '152']",,,[],,

Child psychiatrist Bruce Perry has helped children faced with unimaginable horror: genocide survivors, murder witnesses, kidnapped teenagers, and victims of family violence. In The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog, he tells their stories of trauma and transformation through the lens of science, revealing the brain's astonishing capacity for healing. Deftly combining unforgettable case histories with his own compassionate, insightful strategies for rehabilitation, Perry explains what exactly happens to the brain when a child is exposed to extreme stress-and reveals the unexpected measures that can be taken to ease a child's pain and help him grow into a healthy adult. Through the stories of children who recover-physically, mentally, and emotionally-from the most devastating circumstances, Perry shows how simple things like surroundings, affection, language, and touch can deeply impact the developing brain, for better or for worse. In this deeply informed and moving book, Bruce Perry dramatically demonstrates that only when we understand the science of the mind can we hope to heal the spirit of even the most wounded child.",,,,January 8th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Science', 'Social Work', 'Parenting', 'Education', 'Counselling', 'Mental Illness', 'Medical']",,9780465056521,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387708713l/129909.jpg,4.56,[],195.0,2.0,,129909.The_Boy_Who_Was_Raised_as_a_Dog,,,,,99.0,16953.0,288,,Basic Books,"['11100', '4496', '1113', '195', '49']",,,[],,

The latest generation of titles in this series also feature glossaries and visual elements that complement the classic, familiar format.

This study guide carefully walks you through the novel by providing summaries and critical analyses of each section. You'll also explore the life and background of the author, Ken Kesey, and gain insight into how he came to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

Bruce Fogle,New Encyclopedia Of The Dog,,English,,"It's important to choose our friends wisely, and relationships with man's best friend require a special kind of wisdom. Renowned veterinarian Bruce Fogle (Natural Dog Care) has compiled over 400 pages of helpful advice concerning canine companions, and those looking to learn more about their favorite breeds need look no further. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog's six chapters are filled with gorgeous photos illustrating dogs of all ages from every breed imaginable. While the majority of the book is devoted to explanations of specific breeds, five short chapters provide information on evolution, domestication, health and anatomy, communication, and the roles dogs have played in recent human history. With historical photographs of tapestries, ceramics, and movie posters, as well as intricate diagrams of canine anatomy and charts outlining proper health care, these chapters provide great material for middle-school research papers or science-fair projects. The 310 pages that fall within the ""Domestic Dog Breed"" chapter are further divided into nine categories of dogs that range from fascinating primitives to hard-working livestock and guarding dogs. Each breed has multiple photos, both as an adult and a puppy, and a standard set of information that includes size, weight, life expectancy, date and country of origin, and AKC registration. A few simple icons, explained in this chapter's introduction, provide you with information at a glance--when learning about new breeds, you'll know right away if the dog requires extensive grooming and plenty of exercise, or is suitable for small children and city dwelling. From the popular golden retriever to the exotic xoloitzcuintli, the perfect pooches in these photos would melt even the heart of Cruella DeVille. --Jill Lightner",,,09/14/95,October 5th 2000,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Dogs', 'Animals', 'Science', 'Education']",,9780751304718,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394421777l/2804962.jpg,4.38,[],93.0,1.0,,2804962-new-encyclopedia-of-the-dog,,,,,98.0,280.0,416,,Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd,"['157', '80', '36', '6', '1']",,,[],,

Bruce Henderson (Goodreads Author),Sons and Soldiers: The Untold Story of the Jews Who Escaped the Nazis and Returned with the U.S. Army to Fight Hitler,,,,"Joining the ranks of Unbroken, Band of Brothers, and Boys in the Boat, the little-known saga of young German Jews, dubbed The Ritchie Boys, who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s, came of age in America, and returned to Europe at enormous personal risk as members of the U.S. Army to play a key role in the Allied victory.In 1942, the U.S. Army unleashed one of its greatest secret weapons in the battle to defeat Adolf Hitler: training nearly 2,000 German-born Jews in special interrogation techniques and making use of their mastery of the German language, history, and customs. Known as the Ritchie Boys, they were sent in small, elite teams to join every major combat unit in Europe, where they interrogated German POWs and gathered crucial intelligence that saved American lives and helped win the war.Though they knew what the Nazis would do to them if they were captured, the Ritchie Boys eagerly joined the fight to defeat Hitler. As they did, many of them did not know the fates of their own families left behind in occupied Europe. Taking part in every major campaign in Europe, they collected key tactical intelligence on enemy strength, troop and armored movements, and defensive positions. A postwar Army report found that more than sixty percent of the credible intelligence gathered in Europe came from the Ritchie Boys.Bruce Henderson draws on personal interviews with many surviving veterans and extensive archival research to bring this never-before-told chapter of the Second World War to light. Sons and Soldiers traces their stories from childhood and their escapes from Nazi Germany, through their feats and sacrifices during the war, to their desperate attempts to find their missing loved ones in war-torn Europe.

Bruno Jasieński,Palim Pariz,,Croatian,,"Književno djelo Brune Jasieńskog (1901.-1938.) jednog od najznačajnijih predstavnika poljske avangardne književnosti, kao i njegov životni put, od mladalačke opsjednutosti futurizmom, preko pariškog per aspera ad astra, do surove socrealističke zbilje staljinističke Rusije, i dan-danas izazivaju brojna proturječja. Proganjan od policije radi političkih uvjerenja i razočaran recepcijom svojih futurističko-avangardnih pjesama i priča, Bruno Jasieński 1925. odlazi u Pariz gdje četiri godine živi u bijedi i na rubu gladi. Povezuje se s francuskim komunistima, piše u raznim listovima, da bi 1929. bio protjeran iz Francuske zbog svojeg najpoznatijeg djela: ""Palim Pariz"".Taj katastrofično-fantastični roman o propasti velikoga ""buržoaskog"" grada odmah je po izlasku izazvao pravu buru u francuskoj prijestolnici. Napadi na autora dolazili su sa svih strana, a što je činilo dodatnu reklamu knjizi, pa je prva naklada od 140.000 primjeraka razgrabljena te je ubrzo slijedilo drugo izdanje u 220.000 primjeraka... no Francuzima je tada već puna beretka stranca koji pljuje po njihovoj časti i ugledu te mu ukidaju dozvolu boravka.Na progon iz Francuske, sovjetske su vlasti odgovorile dobrodošlicom i Jasieński je u Moskvi dočekan uz brojne počasti, kao heroj. A onda slijedi naoko zbunjujući obrat, ali i, rekli bismo, priča tipična za eru staljinizma: Jasieński počinje stvarati na ruskom jeziku te postupno postaje socrealističkim piscem i jednim od glavnih propagatora režima, da bi na kraju skončao kao žrtva istog.

Bryan Burrough,Dragonfly: NASA and the Crisis Aboard Mir,,English,,"On 2/12/97, two Russian cosmonauts joined an American astronaut on board the only permanent manned space outpost, the 11-year-old Mir. It was to be a routine mission, the 4th of seven trips to Mir that NASA astronauts would take as dress rehearsals for the two countries' partnership in a new Intern'l Space Station they were building back on Earth. But there'd been bad omens: a Moscow psychic who predicted a mysterious disaster; a Russian doctor who warned that the crew was psychologically incompatible. Within two weeks the omens were borne out, as the three were suddenly forced to fight the worst fire in space history. This was only the beginning of what became the most dangerous mission in the 36-year history of manned space travel--a 6-month misadventure that would climax in the most harrowing accident faced in space since Apollo 13. In Dragonfly, bestselling author Burrough tells the story of how a joint Russian-American crew narrowly survived almost every trauma imaginable: fire, power blackouts, chemical leaks, docking failures, nail-biting spacewalks & constant mechanical breakdowns, all climaxing in a dramatic midspace collision that left all on board scrambling for their lives. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with the cosmonauts, astronauts, ground controllers, psychologists & scientists involved, Dragonfly is the saga of a mission as fraught with political & bureaucratic intrigues as any DC potboiler. Using never-before-released internal NASA memoranda, flight logs & debriefings, Burrough portrays a US space program in which many astronauts refuse to raise safety concerns for fear they'll be frozen out of future missions. It offers an unprecedented look inside the rattletrap Russian space program, where the desperate thirst for hard currency leads to safety shortcuts as exhausted, puppetlike cosmonauts endure inhuman pressures from their unfeeling, all-powerful masters on the ground. In Dragonfly, the American astronauts who journeyed to Mir speak out about the failings of the program, from the rigors of training at Russia's Star City military base to the slapdash experiments they were required to perform. Yet thru it all the men & women of the two space programs persevered, forging friendships that will serve them well as the two countries prepare for the 1st launches of the Intern'l Space Station in late 1998. Theirs is a story of a triumph over adversity, destined to be one of the most enduring & widely celebrated adventure stories of our time.",,,January 16th 1997,January 7th 1999 ,[],Hardcover,"['Space', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Astronomy', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Journalism', 'Biography Memoir']",,9781841150871,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1183162444l/1385708.jpg,4.0,[],17.0,1.0,,1385708.Dragonfly,,,,,94.0,584.0,418,,,"['199', '233', '118', '23', '11']",,,[],,

With Hades and Earth locked in a catastrophic merging of their two realms, Arramos, evil incarnate, plans to use Bonnie to add Second Eden to the merging of the worlds, thereby drawing his forces to Heaven’s Gate, where he hopes to gain access to divine authority.     Arramos has two secret weapons: Sir Devin, the greatest of all dragon slayers, lies in wait to destroy all dragons and their offspring, including Billy and Bonnie; and Mardon, a brilliant scientist, knows the secret to the Oracles’ indestructibility, and he has devised a way to steal it from Acacia, thereby draining her strength.     During these preparations, Semiramis, Mardon’s mother, comes to Second Eden and provides Billy with a wealth of information about Arramos’s plans, and with every subsequent challenge, her words are proven true. But can she be trusted?      With mysteries abounding and an ultimate battle looming, every decision could mean the difference between survival and catastrophe, and only a prophesied sacrifice can stop the onslaught of evil.

Bryan Magee,Ultimate Questions,,,,"How to live meaningfully in the face of the unknowableWe human beings had no say in existing--we just opened our eyes and found ourselves here. We have a fundamental need to understand who we are and the world we live in. Reason takes us a long way, but mystery remains. When our minds and senses are baffled, faith can seem justified--but faith is not knowledge. In Ultimate Questions, acclaimed philosopher Bryan Magee provocatively argues that we have no way of fathoming our own natures or finding definitive answers to the big questions we all face.With eloquence and grace, Magee urges us to be the mapmakers of what is intelligible, and to identify the boundaries of meaningfulness. He traces this tradition of thought to his chief philosophical mentors--Locke, Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer--and shows why this approach to the enigma of existence can enrich our lives and transform our understanding of the human predicament. As Magee puts it, There is a world of difference between being lost in the daylight and being lost in the dark.The crowning achievement to a distinguished philosophical career, Ultimate Questions is a deeply personal meditation on the meaning of life and the ways we should live and face death.-- ""Library Journal""",,,02/22/16,March 1st 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Self Help']",,9780691170657,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445791997l/26597404.jpg,3.97,[],100.0,1.0,,26597404-ultimate-questions,,,,,94.0,225.0,144,,Princeton University Press,"['69', '98', '44', '11', '3']",,,[],,

Bryan Sykes,The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,,English,,"One of the most dramatic stories of genetic discovery since James Watson's The Double Helix—a work whose scientific and cultural reverberations will be discussed for years to come.In 1994 Professor Bryan Sykes, a leading world authority on DNA and human evolution, was called in to examine the frozen remains of a man trapped in glacial ice in northern Italy. News of both the Ice Man's discovery and his age, which was put at over five thousand years, fascinated scientists and newspapers throughout the world. But what made Sykes's story particularly revelatory was his successful identification of a genetic descendant of the Ice Man, a woman living in Great Britain today. How was Sykes able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago?In The Seven Daughters of Eve, he gives us a firsthand account of his research into a remarkable gene, which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line. After plotting thousands of DNA sequences from all over the world, Sykes found that they clustered around a handful of distinct groups. Among Europeans and North American Caucasians, there are, in fact, only seven. This conclusion was staggering: almost everyone of native European descent, wherever they may live throughout the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the Seven Daughters of Eve.Naming them Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine, and Jasmine, Sykes has created portraits of their disparate worlds by mapping the migratory patterns followed by millions of their ancestors. In reading the stories of these seven women, we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, and how we are each living proof of the almost indestructible strands of DNA, which have survived over so many thousands of years. Indeed, The Seven Daughters of Eve is filled with dramatic stories: from Sykes's identification, using DNA samples from two living relatives, of the remains of Tsar Nicholas and Tsaress Alexandra, to the Caribbean woman whose family had been sold into slavery centuries before and whose ancestry Sykes was able to trace back to the Eastern coast of central Africa. Ultimately, Sykes's investigation reveals that, as a race, what humans have in common is more deeply embedded than what separates us.",,,01/01/01,July 17th 2001,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Genetics', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Anthropology', 'Popular Science', 'Reference', 'Historical']",,9780393020182,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386919940l/222637.jpg,3.99,['Prismas Casa de las Ciencias a la Divulgación for Libro editado (2002)'],237.0,4.0,,222637.The_Seven_Daughters_of_Eve,,,,,95.0,6351.0,320,,W.

Bryce G. Hoffman,American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company,,English,,"THE INSIDE STORY OF THE EPIC TURNAROUND OF FORD MOTOR COMPANY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CEO ALAN MULALLY. At the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself. Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys­functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family—America’s last great industrial dynasty—could hold on to their company. Mulally and his team pulled off one of the great­est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. American Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround. On the verge of collapse, Ford went outside the auto industry and recruited Mulally—the man who had already saved Boeing from the deathblow of 9/11—to lead a sweeping restructuring of a company that had been unable to overcome decades of mismanage­ment and denial. Mulally applied the principles he developed at Boeing to streamline Ford’s inefficient operations, force its fractious executives to work together as a team, and spark a product renaissance in Dearborn. He also convinced the United Auto Workers to join his fight for the soul of American manufacturing. Bryce Hoffman reveals the untold story of the covert meetings with UAW leaders that led to a game-changing contract, Bill Ford’s battle to hold the Ford family together when many were ready to cash in their stock and write off the company, and the secret alliance with Toyota and Honda that helped prop up the Amer­ican automotive supply base. In one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meet­ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry.  Hoffman was granted unprecedented access to Ford’s top executives and top-secret company documents. He spent countless hours with Alan Mulally, Bill Ford, the Ford family, former executives, labor leaders, and company directors.

When his military days were over, Simmons, a former Air Force sergeant, began a torturous series of acts of violence and humiliation against his family. While a fierce presence to his wife, Becky, and six of their seven children, he became exceptionally tender with his favorite daughter, Sheila, and forced her into an incestuous relationship that culminated in the birth of a child. Simmons went through a series of menial jobs and, after several moves, finally settled his family in the foothills of the Ozarks. But faced with growing frustration of his need for control, along with his daughter's rejection of him and marriage to another man, which he claimed had ruined his plans to have a happy life alone with her, he prepared the ritual killing of all those who had made his dream unworkable. While for the most part, Williams ( Tankwar ) and Marshall, a journalist, tell the story convincingly, they fail when they attempt to re-create and explain Simmons's thought processes.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Library Journal",,,,March 1st 1991,[],Hardcover,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime']",,9780671685119,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420616914l/1020302.jpg,3.85,[],75.0,1.0,,1020302.Zero_at_the_Bone,,,,,93.0,120.0,302,,Pocket Books,"['36', '41', '35', '5', '3']",,,[],,

Budd Schulberg,What Makes Sammy Run?,,English,,"What Makes Sammy Run?Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times—from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.",,,10/29/41,May 7th 2002,['Sammy Glick'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Film', 'American', 'Literature', 'Media Tie In', 'Philosophy', 'Contemporary', 'Psychology']",,9780375508318,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171476932l/101191.jpg,4.09,[],195.0,2.0,,101191.What_Makes_Sammy_Run_,,,,,96.0,2122.0,320,,Random House,"['750', '909', '382', '63', '18']",,,[],,

Buddy Levy (Goodreads Author),River of Darkness: Francisco Orellana's Legendary Voyage of Death and Discovery Down the Amazon,,English,,"From the acclaimed author of Conquistador comes this thrilling account of one of history’s greatest adventures of discovery. With cinematic immediacy and meticulous attention to historical detail, here is the true story of a legendary sixteenth-century explorer and his death-defying navigation of the Amazon—river of darkness, pathway to gold.In 1541, the brutal conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro and his well-born lieutenant Francisco Orellana set off from Quito in search of La Canela, South America’s rumored Land of Cinnamon, and the fabled El Dorado, “the golden man.” Driving an enormous retinue of mercenaries, enslaved natives, horses, hunting dogs, and other animals across the Andes, they watched their proud expedition begin to disintegrate even before they descended into the nightmarish jungle, following the course of a powerful river. Soon hopelessly lost in the swampy labyrinth, their numbers diminishing daily through disease, starvation, and Indian attacks, Pizarro and Orellana made a fateful decision to separate. While Pizarro eventually returned home barefoot and in rags, Orellana and fifty-seven men, in a few fragile craft, continued downriver into the unknown reaches of the mighty Amazon, serenaded by native war drums and the eerie cries of exotic predators. Theirs would be the greater glory.   Interweaving eyewitness accounts of the quest with newly uncovered details, Buddy Levy reconstructs the seminal journey that has electrified adventurers ever since, as Orellana became the first European to navigate and explore the entire length of the world’s largest river. Levy gives a long-overdue account of the native populations—some peaceful and welcoming, offering sustenance and life-saving guidance, others ferociously hostile, subjecting the invaders to gauntlets of unremitting attack and intimations of terrifying rituals. And here is the Amazon itself, a powerful presence whose every twist and turn held the promise of new wonders both natural and man-made, as well as the ever-present risk of death—a river that would hold Orellana in its irresistible embrace to the end of his life. Overflowing with violence and beauty, nobility and tragedy, River of Darkness is both riveting history and a breathtaking adventure that will sweep readers along on an epic voyage unlike any other.",,,,February 22nd 2011,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Survival', 'Historical', 'World History', 'Nature', 'Adult']",,9780553807509,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320390342l/9152282.jpg,4.13,[],100.0,1.0,,9152282-river-of-darkness,,,,,96.0,1857.0,324,,Bantam,"['711', '769', '303', '54', '20']",,,[],,

Burl Barer (Goodreads Author),Man Overboard: The Counterfeit Resurrection of Phil Champagne,,English,,"“True crime at its best. … Barer has undeniable talent, pizzaz and imagination!”—Jack Olsen, bestselling author and award-winning journalist.  1982: Oregon businessman Phil Champagne, age 52, dies in a tragic boating accident off Lopez Island. He is survived by one ex-wife, four adult children, an octogenarian mother, and two despondent brothers. Phil didn't know he was dead until he read it in the paper. All things considered, he took it rather well. So did Phil's brother, Mitch, the beneficiary of a 1.5 million dollar policy on Phil's life.  1992: Wastington restauranteur Harold Stegeman, famous for his thick, juicy steaks, is arrested by the Secret Service for printing counterfeit United States currency in an Idaho shed. In addition to the bogus bills, Stegeman also has a fraudulently obtained passport, a fabricated Cayman Island drivers license, and Phil Champagne's fingerprints.  When the uproarious reality of Harold Stegeman's secret identity hit the headlines, the counterfeit resurrection of Phil Champagne became one of the most celebrated and hysterically funny true-crime stories of the twentieth century. And while every supermarket tabloid and television talk show hounded after the untold story, only Edgar Award winner Burl Barer captured Champagne's confidence and received permission to detail Phil's post-mortem career of fraud, deception, trickery, lies, and fine prime rib, bringing to life the exploits of a man his family thought dead over a decade ago.  “Crisp as a freshly printed C-note. Exceptionally clever and vastly entertaining!”—Lee Goldberg, author, screenwriter and television producer.  “Barer does it again! A deft and dazzling display of solid research and rapier wit—a must for all true crime aficionados.”—Gary C.

"Buzz Aldrin (Goodreads Author), Ken Abraham",Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon,,English,,"Forty years ago, Buzz Aldrin became the second human, minutes after Neil Armstrong, to set foot on a celestial body other than the Earth. The event remains one of mankind’s greatest achievements and was witnessed by the largest worldwide television audience in history. In the years since, millions more have had their Earth-centric perspective unalterably changed by the iconic photograph of Aldrin standing on the surface of the moon, the blackness of space behind him and his fellow explorer and the Eagle reflected in his visor. Describing the alien world he was walking upon, he uttered the words “magnificent desolation.” And as the astronauts later sat in the Eagle, waiting to begin their journey back home, knowing that they were doomed unless every system and part on board worked flawlessly, it was Aldrin who responded to Mission Control’s clearance to take off with the quip, “Roger. Understand. We’re number one on the runway.”The flight of Apollo 11 made Aldrin one of the most famous persons on our planet, yet few people know the rest of this true American hero’s story. In Magnificent Desolation, Aldrin not only gives us a harrowing first-person account of the lunar landing that came within seconds of failure and the ultimate insider’s view of life as one of the superstars of America’s space program, he also opens up with remarkable candor about his more personal trials–and eventual triumphs–back on Earth. From the glory of being part of the mission that fulfilled President Kennedy’s challenge to reach the moon before the decade was out, Aldrin returned home to an Air Force career stripped of purpose or direction, other than as a public relations tool that NASA put to relentless use in a seemingly nonstop world tour. The twin demons of depression and alcoholism emerged–the first of which Aldrin confronted early and publicly, and the second of which he met with denial until it nearly killed him. He burned through two marriages, his Air Force career came to an inglorious end, and he found himself selling cars for a living when he wasn’t drunkenly wrecking them. Redemption came when he finally embraced sobriety, gained the love of a woman, Lois, who would become the great joy of his life, and dedicated himself to being a tireless advocate for the future of space exploration–not only as a scientific endeavor but also as a thriving commercial enterprise.These days Buzz Aldrin is enjoying life with an enthusiasm that reminds us how far it is possible for a person to travel, literally and figuratively. As an adventure story, a searing memoir of self-destruction and self-renewal, and as a visionary rallying cry to once again set our course for Mars and beyond, Magnificent Desolation is the thoroughly human story of a genuine hero.",,First Edition,01/01/09,June 23rd 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Space', 'Science', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Historical']",,9780307463456,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320448912l/6351887.jpg,3.57,[],99.0,1.0,,6351887-magnificent-desolation,,,,,85.0,1544.0,336,,Harmony Books,"['328', '491', '497', '191', '37']",,,[],,
Byrne R.S. Fone (Editor ),The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature: Readings from Western Antiquity to the Present Day,,English,,"In the three decades since New York City's Stonewall rebellion, gay literature has exploded as a distinctive form of cultural expression. In a variety of styles and genres, gay men have increasingly begun to articulate their sexual identities. At the same time, gay writers and scholars have begun in earnest the search for a literary history long denied by the refusal to recognize homosexual love as an integral part of Western literature. Yet to date, no single volume has brought together the full range of poetry, fiction, essays, and autobiography that portray love between men.From the Epic of Gilgamesh to the poems of Allen Ginsberg and gay literature of the 1980s and '90s, The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature draws together hundreds of texts from Western literary history that describe experiences of love, friendship, intimacy, desire, and sex among men. While other anthologies have focused primarily on poetry, drama, or fiction, this volume is the first to include a full range of genres. Spanning more than two millennia, from ancient Mesopotamia to the late twentieth century, this anthology brings together the best-known texts of gay male writing such as the poetry of Martial and Walt Whitman, and excerpts from E. M. Forster's Maurice, as well as from lesser known works such as nineteenth-century English homoerotic poetry and selections from two early American novels of homosexual love--Joseph and His Friend and Imre.In The Columbia Anthology readers become acquainted with the early bonds of male companionship found in Homer's writings on Zeus and Ganymede, and with the homoerotic poetry of Catullus and Juvenal. From Shakespeare's Sonnets to the philosophy of de Sade, to the political writings of Edmund White, this masterful anthology traces a multifaceted tradition.Arranged chronologically, sections are supplemented by illuminating introductory essays; many individual pieces include background commentary on the writer and the work.As a landmark to the enduring spirit of gay writers, this collection is an essential addition to the library of anyone searching for the historical foundations of gay identities. With its excellent annotations and suggestions for further reading, The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature will also serve as an invaluable resource to students and scholars in need of a guide to a massive body of literature that has long been hidden, ignored, or misrepresented.",,,01/01/98,April 12th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Literature', 'LGBT', 'Nonfiction', 'Anthologies', 'History', 'Queer Studies']",,9780231096713,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371333029l/1341693.jpg,4.35,[],91.0,1.0,,1341693.The_Columbia_Anthology_of_Gay_Literature,,,,,100.0,37.0,912,,Columbia University Press,"['18', '14', '5', '0', '0']",,,[],,

"Byron Katie (Goodreads Author), Stephen Mitchell (Goodreads Author)",Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life,,English,,"Out of nowhere, like a breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and “The Work.” In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls “a lover of reality.”",,,10/30/02,December 23rd 2003,[],Paperback,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Inspirational', 'Audiobook', 'Relationships', 'Mental Health']",,9781400045372,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388258105l/9762.jpg,4.1,[],98.0,1.0,,9762.Loving_What_Is,,,,,91.0,18329.0,352,,Harmony,"['8620', '5176', '2937', '991', '605']",,,[],,
