G Egore Pitir,Face of Our Father,,,,"Pitir does it again! Some authors speak of genre bending, some authors prove it. After winning the 2015 Best Indie Book Award for Action/Adventure and receiving the B.R.A.G. Medallion, FACE OF OUR FATHER was just awarded the Bronze Medal for Popular Fiction by the 2016 eLit Awards. This novel has it all. One part ""The Bourne Identity,"" one part ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and one part ""The Notebook,"" this poignant tale leaves the reader haunted by its characters long after the novel's final page has turned. Stuart and Angela Pierce, like many disillusioned careerists, are busy reinventing their lives. Stu reduces his airline flying schedule to train for triathlons, while Angie escapes the daily horrors of a prosecutor's job to pursue pro bono work. But death threats soon prove that the only thing Angie escaped was the protective arm of the District Attorney's office. With a graphic photo of a ritual stoning Stu's only tangible clue, he sets out to protect a wife who refuses to protect herself. Obsessed with catching a murdering rapist, Angie plunges them both into a web of global intrigue. But who, indeed what, is the real enemy? Honor. Love. Life. All are at stake as the Pierces struggle to uncover the truth, both the enemy's, and their own. Sometimes the biggest enemy can be the one right next to you... FACE OF OUR FATHER is too literary to be a thriller, yet too thrilling to put down-a unique blend of action and intimacy-a thriller with a soul. How often does fiction change how we define integrity, prejudice, and evil?

Harry, as head Auror, has been sent to the United States to help investigate a nefarious underground group whose proclaimed goals are to unite the Muggle and magical world by any means necessary. Unwilling to be separated for the lengthy trip, Ginny insists that family accompany Harry, launching a year long journey to the United States and the American wizarding school of Alma Aleron.Determined to avoid adventure for the term, James finds himself unwittingly pulled into an international incident involving Petra Morganstern, who has accompanied the family to the states along with her younger Muggle step-sister Izabella. Apparently framed for a crime she didn't commit, James, Ralph and Zane must prove Petra's innocence before she is separated from Izzy forever.Complicating matters, however, is the very real possibility that, despite James' growing feelings for Petra, she may indeed be guilty of the crime she has been accused of, and perhaps even worse things. Because Petra, as James slowly learns, is no ordinary witch. Her magic is mysteriously powerful, even without a wand, and headmaster Merlin himself seems wary of her.In the end, James must choose to confront the truth that he has been seeking, knowing that it may well shatter his perception of the girl he loves, and even the stability of the magical world at large.",James Potter #3,,,January 1st 2010,"['James Sirius Potter', 'Lily Luna Potter', 'Albus Severus Potter', 'Rose Weasley', 'Zane Walker', 'Ralph Deedle', 'Petra Morganstern', 'Harry Potter']",ebook,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Adventure', 'Fan Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Witches', 'Childrens', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498509799l/7487564._SY475_.jpg,3.76,[],451.0,5.0,,7487564-james-potter-and-the-vault-of-destinies,,,,,85.0,9175.0,576,,,"['2931', '3005', '1901', '747', '591']",,,['Alma Aleron School of Magical Humanities and Spellcraft (United States)'],,

But just once it would be nice to be able to really talk to a man, the way she can talk to Fearghus the Destroyer.Too bad that Fearghus is a dragon, of the large, scaly and deadly type. With him, Annwyl feels safe—a far cry from the feelings aroused by the hard-bodied, arrogant knight Fearghus has arranged to help train her for battle.

According to dragon law, Talaith is now his property, for pleasure…or otherwise. But if Lord Arrogance thinks she’s the kind of damsel to acquiesce without a word, he’s in for a surprise…Is the woman never silent? Briec the Mighty knew the moment he laid eyes on Talaith that she would be his, but he’d counted on tongue-lashings of an altogether different sort. It’s embarrassing, really, that it isn’t this outspoken female’s magicks that have the realm’s greatest dragon in her thrall.

G.B. Edwards,The Book of Ebenezer Le Page,,English,,"Ebenezer Le Page, cantankerous, opinionated, and charming, is one of the most compelling literary creations of the late twentieth century. Eighty years old, Ebenezer has lived his whole life on the Channel Island of Guernsey, a stony speck of a place caught between the coasts of England and France yet a world apart from either. Ebenezer himself is fiercely independent, but as he reaches the end of his life he is determined to tell his own story and the stories of those he has known. He writes of family secrets and feuds, unforgettable friendships and friendships betrayed, love glimpsed and lost. The Book of Ebenezer Le Page is a beautifully detailed chronicle of a life, but it is equally an oblique reckoning with the traumas of the twentieth century, as Ebenezer recalls both the men lost to the Great War and the German Occupation of Guernsey during World War II, and looks with despair at the encroachments of commerce and tourism on his beloved island.

  ¿Usted cree que una IA devenida en CA (Conciencia Artificial) puede gobernarnos mejor, igual o peor al modo en que lo hacemos? ¿Y si los que se quedaran sin trabajo fueran gobiernos y políticos?
 Visionarios como Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking o Mark Zuckerberg discuten y advierten. Si usted no ha entendido el trasfondo del libro ""El planeta de los simios"" de Pierre Boulle, (algo que solo puede apreciarse en las películas viejas), y en cuál de las cinco castas de monos encaja su personalidad en la sociedad, jamás entenderá por qué las sociedades están partidas al medio por una grieta (Síndrome DMA) que las lleva a un vértigo de confrontación eterno sin importar épocas e ideologías. Cuando usted aprenda a reconocer a los cinco tipos de personalidades humanas que interactúan en la sociedad, entenderá el perverso mecanismo de relojería social del que somos víctimas, y podrá reconocer de antemano al mentiroso y manipulador que nos divide. Entenderlo es la mejor cura social... pero tenga cuidado, esa persona podría ser usted.  
   SINOPSIS. 
   En un par de crones, durante el colapso demográfico de La Vía Láctea, la humanidad se prepara para dar el gran salto intergaláctico hacia Andrómeda dejando atrás la metalurgia para comenzar a adoptar un modo de vida biopunk. Imposibilitados de saciar las demandas sociales de toda índole, y ante el hastío generalizado por la falta de control a cualquier tipo de gobierno, la democracia claudica por su propio peso, y surge una algocracia galáctica, acéfala y autorregulada, regida por un grupo de procesadores de IA cuánticos que gobiernan carentes de maldad humana, Los Sabios Errantes. Protegidos por el amparo que otorgan los mitos, y sin ubicación física aparente para evitar atentados o derrocamientos, estos pueden trascender a cuerpos cultivados o volver a ser parte de la Expandnet cuántica galáctica, y gobernar desde allí soltando plebiscitos instantáneos y recurrentes, logrando de esa manera puentear los dos eternos bandos antagónicos dentro de las sociedades, para que la hiperpoblación autogestione directamente leyes de cualquier tipo, sin la necesidad de existencia de líderes políticos y gobiernos humanos.  En ese escenario, un ingenuo inventor bienintencionado, llamado Peter Adams, surge con la revolución más fantástica de todos los tiempos…, y es allí, ante la falta de registros históricos, donde Los Sabios Errantes requieren ayuda de interpretación para aplicar en sus algoritmos. Sin entender el motivo de la convocatoria por parte de Los Sabios, Isaac Mustafá Lee Svensson, en pleno duelo por la reciente tragedia de su esposa, es convocado para ser veedor de este descubrimiento carente de precedentes. De a poco se involucrará emocionalmente con esta revolución, y junto a Peter y la bella María, una biológica con capacidades químicas y genómicas asignada por Los Sabios para acompañarlos como asistente al planeta Darwin, entenderá el motivo evolutivo por el cual fue el misterioso y único elegido entre la infinidad de humanos dispersos en la galaxia.    Inspirado en parte por el guion de “Metrópolis” de Fritz Lang, algo de “Fundación y Tierra” de Asimov, y la idea de las promesas soltadas a los muertos que otorga “Pedro Páramo” de Juan Rulfo.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WWKTPG",,,,July 12th 2017,[],Kindle Edition,[],,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500222627l/35688170._SX318_.jpg,4.63,[],97.0,1.0,,35688170-algocracia-cu-ntica,,,,,100.0,8.0,312,,,"['5', '3', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,

  Compilado de tres libros en uno de Ciencia Ficción. 
  Ciencia ficción contemporánea y racionalista de G.G.Melies. Una muy buena y abundante elección para fanáticos del género. En esta edición G.G.Melies nos entrega tres libros de historias originales y distintas, donde le será absolutamente imposible predecir el nudo y el desenlace que lo tomarán por sorpresa. El desarrollo de la historia es una de las características del autor, que busca siempre mantenerse dentro de la senda del racionalismo sin llegar a la Sci Fi fantástica y carente de fundamentos aceptables. El tramado del relato dentro de los parámetros de la realidad, las hipótesis actuales de la física y el conocimiento es una de las caracteristicas que lo enmarcan.  
  Teoría rudimentaria sobre estados entrelazados y gemelos.
  Scott y Andrew, gemelos separados por las distancias entre la Tierra y Marte, pueden presentirse el uno al otro cuando están en peligro con mayor rapidez de lo que tardan las comunicaciones entre ambos planetas. Inspirado en el libro de Alejandro Dumas ""Los hermanos corsos"" esta novela ambientada en una colonia de Marte y en la Tierra luego de las Greenwars (movimientos eco-terroristas pro planeta donde milita Andrew) traza un paralelismo entre la comunicación de partículas cuánticas y la mente humana desde la concepción.  
  40° Rugientes, 50° Furiosos, 60° Aulladores. Paranoia por asistencia gravitatoria.
  Ficción náutica que toma matices de ciencia ficción en capítulos avanzados, y muestra un sutil paralelismo entre la exploración marina y espacial. Lara y Julio, una pareja recién casada se embarca en una luna de miel de aventuras en un martes trece del año 2213 rumbo a Cabo de Hornos. Es un viaje temático ambientado en 1933 en una vieja goleta de madera de esa época, desprovista de tecnología y donde deberán dejarla antes de abordar. La nave llamada ""Destino"" perteneciente a la familia de Álvaro, un particular Capitán fanático de la edad de oro de la ciencia ficción, carga ese romanticismo que le otorga su dueño y también tiene sus reglas de convivencia. Una novela con humor y aventura donde el mix de personajes del pasaje lo divertirá en sus conflictos de convivencia en las aguas más peligrosas del planeta.  
  ALGOCRACIA CUÁNTICA. Las conciencias muertas de Sagitario A*
  Es un sueño de utopía perfecta para la humanidad. G.G.Melies plantea que tal vez no haya que temer a las inteligencias artificiales sino pisar el acelerador. Es la obra más política y fantástica sin perder la racionalidad debido al contexto futuro que la enmarca; dos crones de aquí en más. El autor nos muestra una Vía Láctea colonizada donde la democracia colapsó por la ""Metáfora del cuarto de baño"" de Asimov, y donde surge un sistema acéfalo y autogestionado de gobierno sin humanos. Los políticos, presidentes, reyes y dictadores son parte del pasado y se vota cada pequeña ley desde dispositivos cuánticos sin demora en los resultados y sin intervención humana. Todas las leyes y distribución de recursos es gestionado con celeridad por la Algocracia ejercida por Conciencias Artificiales (Los Sabios Errantes) que pueden autocultivarse en cuerpos en cualquier rincón de la galaxia si las situaciones lo requiriesen.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0787QN8FG",,,,December 12th 2017,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B0787QN8FG,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513310360l/37539893._SX318_.jpg,3.5,[],97.0,1.0,,37539893-edici-n-especial-de-ciencia-ficci-n-g-g-melies,,,,,75.0,4.0,652,,,[],,,[],,

Gurdjieff (1866-1949) has come to be recognized as one of the most original, enduring, and penetrating of our century. While Gurdjieff used many different means to transmit his vision of the human dilemma and human possibility, he gave special importance to his acknowledged masterwork, Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson.  Beelzebub's Tales is an ""ocean of story"" and of ideas that one can explore for a lifetime. It is majestic in scale and content, challengingly inventive in prose style, and, for those very reasons, often approached with apprehension. The first English language edition of the Russian original appeared in 1950. Since then, readers have recognized the need for a revised translation that would clarify the verbal surface while respecting the author's own thought and style.  This revised edition, in preparation for many years under the direction of Gurdjieff's closest pupil, Jeanne de Salzmann, meets this need. Originally published in 1992, this translation offers a new experience of Gurdjieff's masterpiece for contemporary readers.

Their fanatically held opinions—leading to a duel that is proposed but never fought—inspire a host of comic adventures whose allegorical levels vigorously explore the debate between theism and atheism.Martin Gardner's superb introduction to The Ball and the Cross reveals the real-life debate between Chesterton and a famous atheist that provided inspiration for the story, and it explores some of the novel's possible allegorical meanings.

G.K. Chesterton,Heretics,,English,,"G. K. Chesterton, the ""Prince of Paradox,"" is at his witty best in this collection of twenty essays and articles from the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing on ""heretics"" — those who pride themselves on their superiority to Christian views — Chesterton appraises prominent figures who fall into that category from the literary and art worlds. Luminaries such as Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and James McNeill Whistler come under the author's scrutiny, where they meet with equal measures of his characteristic wisdom and good humor.In addition to incisive assessments of well-known individuals (""Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Making the World Small"" and ""Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants""), these essays contain observations on the wider world. ""On Sandals and Simplicity,"" ""Science and the Savages,"" ""On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of the Family,"" ""On Smart Novelists and the Smart Set,"" and ""Slum Novelists and the Slums"" reflect the main themes of Chesterton's life's work. Heretics roused the ire of some critics for censuring contemporary philosophies without providing alternatives; the author responded a few years later with a companion volume, Orthodoxy. Sardonic, jolly, and generous, both books are vintage Chesterton.He is criticizing those who hold incomplete and inadequate views about ""life, the universe, and everything."" He is, in short, criticizing all that host of non-Christian views of reality, as he demonstrated in his follow-up book Orthodoxy. The book is both an easy read and a difficult read. But he manages to demonstrate, among other things, that our new 21st century heresies are really not new because he himself deals with most of them.",,,10/30/05,June 23rd 2006,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Classics', 'Catholic', 'Faith', 'Essays']",,9780486449142,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416873240l/612143.jpg,4.18,[],100.0,1.0,,612143.Heretics,,,,,96.0,3748.0,176,,Dover Publications,"['1583', '1427', '587', '125', '26']",,,[],,

A steadfast champion of the working man, family, and faith, Chesterton eloquently opposed materialism, snobbery, hypocrisy, and any adversary of freedom and simplicity in modern society.Culled from the thousands of essays he contributed to newspapers and periodicals over his lifetime, the critical works collected for this edition pulse with the author's unique brand of clever commentary.

""When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were three of them with spiked bracelets."" Not long after he published Orthodoxy, G. K. Chesterton moved from London to Beaconsfield, and met Father O'Connor. O'Connor had a shrewd insight to the darker side of man's nature and a mild appearance to go with it--and together those came together to become Chesterton's unassuming Father Brown. Chesterton loved the character, and the magazines he wrote for loved the stories.

G.K. Chesterton,The Everlasting Man,,English,,"What, if anything, is it that makes the human uniquely human? This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. ""Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world,"" he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon.  As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) ""very plain and emphatic."" He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true.

G.K. Chesterton,The Napoleon of Notting Hill,,English,,"In a London of the future, the drudgery of capitalism and bureaucracy have worn the human spirit down to the point where it can barely stand. When a pint-sized clerk named Auberon Quinn is randomly selected as head of state, he decides to turn London into a medieval carnival for his own amusement. One man, Adam Wayne, takes the new order of things seriously, organizing a Notting Hill army to fight invaders from other neighborhoods. At first his project baffles everyone, but eventually his dedication proves infectious, with delightful results. First published in 1904, The Napoleon of Notting Hill was Chesterton's first novel.

G.K. Chesterton,Orthodoxy,,English,,"This book is meant to be a companion to ""Heretics,"" and to put the positive side in addition to the negative. Many critics complained of the book because it merely criticised current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy. This book is an attempt to answer the challenge. It is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it. The book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle and its answer. It deals first with all the writer's own solitary and sincere speculations and then with the startling style in which they were all suddenly satisfied by the Christian Theology. The writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed.

G.K. Chesterton,The Ballad of the White Horse,,English,,"The Ballad of the White Horse is one of the last great epic poems in the English language. On the one hand it describes King Alfred's battle against the Danes in 878. On the other hand it is a timeless allegory about the ongoing battle between Christianity and the forces of nihilistic heathenism. Filled with colorful characters, thrilling battles and mystical visions, it is as lively as it is profound. Chesterton incorporates brilliant imagination, atmosphere, moral concern, chronological continuity, wisdom and fancy. He makes his stanzas reverberate with sound, and hurries his readers into the heart of the battle. This deluxe volume is the definitive edition of the poem. It exactly reproduces the 1928 edition with Robert Austin's beautiful woodcuts, and includes a thorough introduction and wonderful endnotes by Sister Bernadette Sheridan, from her 60 years researching the poem.""When Chesterton writes poetry, he excels like no other modern writer. The rhyme, rhythm, alliteration and imagery are a complete joy to the ear. But The Ballad of the White Horse is not just a poem.

Gabor Maté,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,,English,,"He would probably dispute it, but Gabor Maté is something of a compassion machine. Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Maté never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Maté observes, ""Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves."" In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Maté's most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Maté looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such catastrophe on themselves.Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril. When it comes to combating the drug trade and the ravages of addiction, society can use all the help it can get. --Kim Hughes",,,02/12/07,February 12th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Science', 'Mental Health', 'Self Help', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Social Work', 'Memoir']",,9780676977400,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327970900l/617702.jpg,4.48,['Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize (2009)'],60.0,1.0,,617702.In_the_Realm_of_Hungry_Ghosts,,,,,98.0,7872.0,480,,Knopf Canada,"['4710', '2400', '626', '104', '32']",,,[],,

The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez,One Hundred Years of Solitude,,,Fiction,"One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career.

The carefully orchestrated abductions were Escobar's attempt to extort from the government its assurance that he, and other narcotics traffickers, would not be extradited to the United States if they were to surrender.From the highest corridors of government to the domain of the ruthless drug cartels, we watch the unfolding of a bizarre drama replete with fascinating characters Cesar Gaviria, the nation's cool and secretive president; Diana Turbay, a famous television journalist and magazine editor; three indomitable women who are imprisoned for miserable months in a small room with a light perpetually on; an eighty-two-year-old priest with a mission to bring the regime and the cartel to the negotiating table; and Escobar himself, the legendary drug baron who changes his bodyguards daily and maintains a private zoo with giraffes and hippos from Africa.All of this takes place in a country where presidential candidates and cabinet officers are routinely assassinated; where police go into the Medellín slums to murder boys they think may be working for Escobar; but where brave and honest citizens are trying desperately to make democracy survive.An international best-seller, News of a Kidnapping combines journalistic tenacity with the breathtaking language and perception that distinguish the writings of Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez.

Gabriel McCaughry,hAurorae. The recalling or the retelling of the many Pasts made Present & Whole again.,,,,"• By Gabriel McCaughry (Editor-in-chief of Anathema Publishing Ltd.)• Preface by Shani Oates (Maid of the Clan of Tubal Cain, and author of Tubelos Green Fire, Crafting the Arte of Tradition, and The Devils Supper)• Thoroughly illumined by the talented artist José Gabriel Alegría Sabogal (Handbook of Sacred Anatomy, and A Second Nature)(h)Auroræ is a mystifying, albeit utterly profound journey. Part ontological synthesis, philosophical rambling, magickal diary, visual grimoire, inspired mystical poem, revelatory/individuation process, and part alchemical vessel of expression, the book exists under the umbrella of what the author refers to as Gnostic Luciferianism. First and foremost, however, (h)Auroræ exists as an act of eternal remembrance.“This alchemical treatise walks us through a startling expression of emotive gnosis… (h)Auroræ seeks beyond and above the all-too-human condition in order to understand it, and advance it vis-à-vis a sensual Sophianic psychology, witnessed in cogitation. Mind in tandem with vision, incorporates a veiled process of subtle Jungian analysis leading to a Grail quest, of intent to remove the blindfold from the Holy Fool… A work of pilgrimage, conjunction and apotheosis, it directs the reader through pause, anticipation and intake. Sometimes rapturous, sometimes ponderous.”  (~Shani Oates, Preface to (h)Aurorae.)G. McCaughry writes:“This Opus Alchymicum is presented in a certain “light” and, at its core, (h)Auroræ is centred on the sempiternal theosophical discourse which sparks anew the Flame of Old within the heart of the predisposed reader, struggling, yet inclined, to separate the subtil from the dross so that we may uncover our inner philosophers stone or perfected being.“Tis a work of Agapae, in the purest sense of the words“This manuscript, far from being a modern-day grimoire by any means, is, primarily, a mystical handbook. A useful resource to have by ones side upon undertaking an initiatory odyssey on the Path of Exile & Exalt – regardless of which favoured system or tradition the practitioner employs.”(h)Auroræ is Gabriel McCaughrys first published manuscript, a tome which correlates directly with Anathema Publishings mandate, and his views and methodologies on alchemical book-making. This is very much a continuation in the spirit of his previous contributions to the PILLARS occult periodical (and elsewhere), but within (h)Auroræ these concepts are fully developed and actualized.“A supreme work of Beauty, in every sense of that aesthetic. A sublime work of Arte, in every sense of that metaphysic. In short, a meditational treatise of transformative alchemy of – and for – the Soul.”  (~Shani Oates)¶ Hardcover Standard Edition (limited to approx. 500 copies):5.25 x 8.5 inches. 304 pages.

Gabriel Packard,The Painted Ocean,,English,,"When I was a little girl, my dad left me and my mum, and he never came back. And you're supposed to be gutted when that happens. But secretly I preferred it without him, cos it meant I had my mum completely to myself, without having to share her with anyone. And I sort of inherited all the affection she used to give to my dad - like he'd left it behind for me as a gift, to say sorry for deserting meSo says eleven year old Shruti of her broken home in suburban middle England. But hopes of her mother's affection are in vain: speaking little English, and fluent in only Hindi and Punjabi, Shruti's mother is lost, and soon falls prey to family pressure to remarry. To find another husband means returning to India and leaving Shruti behind.Meanwhile at school a new arrival, the indomitable Meena, dispenses with Shruti's bullying problems and transforms her day to day life. Desperate for companionship Shruti latches on to Meena to the point of obsession, following her through high school and on to university. But when Meena invites Shruti to join her on holiday in India, she has no idea how dangerous her obsession will turn out to be...Gabriel Packard's THE PAINTED OCEAN has been described by Colum McCann 'as fearless tour de force.

Gabriel Wyner,Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It,,English,,"The ultimate rapid language-learning guide! For those who’ve despaired of ever learning a foreign language, here, finally, is a book that will make the words stick. At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks six languages fluently.  He didn’t learn them in school -- who does? -- rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources. In Fluent Forever Wyner reveals what he’s discovered.   The greatest challenge to learning a foreign language is the challenge of memory; there are just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem to forget two old ones, and as a result, fluency can seem out of reach. Fluent Forever tackles this challenge head-on. With empathy for the language-challenged and abundant humor, Wyner deconstructs the learning process, revealing how to build a foreign language in your mind from the ground up.  Starting with pronunciation, you’ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar sounds. You'll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you'll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery, rather than translations, which will enable you to think in a foreign language.  And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you'll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in minutes every day. Soon, you'll gain the ability to learn grammar and more difficult abstract words--without the tedious drills and exercises of language classes and grammar books.  This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.",,,,August 5th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Language', 'Self Help', 'Linguistics', 'Education', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Reference', 'How To']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387702551l/19661852.jpg,4.19,[],97.0,1.0,,19661852-fluent-forever,,,,,96.0,6934.0,326,,Harmony,"['2875', '2831', '981', '191', '56']",,,[],,

  Editorial review

  I absolutely love this book! I especially treasure the author’s takeaways at the end of each interview. As an introvert myself, I can identify with so many! I so appreciate how she made the connections between what has been said and how this applies to other introverts. These valuable chapters of exploration help us understand, appreciate and further develop our own unique strengths.

Amid the pristine, island-dotted lakes, the granite cliffs, and pine-scented forests of the Canadian wilderness, the young and carefree amuse themselves with glittering balls, lavish picnics, and friendly competitions. But this summer promises to be different when the charming, ambitious, and destitute son of a disowned heir joins his wealthy family at their cottage on Wyndwood Island.Through Jack's introduction into the privileged life of the aristocratic Wyndhams and their social circle - including captains of industry and financial titans - he seeks opportunities and alliances to better himself, including in his schemes, his beautiful, headstrong, and audacious cousin, Victoria.A cast of engaging characters vividly brings to life the idyllic lifestyle of endless summers on tranquil lakes.

Gabriele Wills (Goodreads Author),Elusive Dawn,,English,,"It happened slowly at first. Thread by thread, the fabric of privilege and complacency enveloping the Wyndham family began to unravel. A carefree summer at their island house, disrupted by the arrival of long lost kin, ended in tragedy, betrayal, and war. Now, in the compelling sequel to the acclaimed epic, The Summer Before The Storm, Ria and her friends find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control. It's late summer, 1916. While some members of the Wyndham family revel in the last resplendent days of the season at their Muskoka cottage, others continue to be drawn inexorably into the Great War, going from a world of misty sunrises across a tranquil lake to deadly moonlight bombing raids, festering trenches, and visceral terror. For Ria, too many things have happened to hope that life would ever return to normal, that innocence could be regained. Caught in a vortex of turbulent events and emotions, she abandons the safety of the sidelines in Britain for the nightmare of France. Her fate as an ambulance driver remains entwined with those of her summer friends, all bound by a sense of duty. Living in the shadows of fear and danger awakens the urgency to grasp life, to live more immediately, more passionately amid the enormity of unprecedented death. Together, their lives weave a tale of liberation and loss, evolution and redemption.

"Gabrielle Giffords, Mark Edward Kelly",Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,,English,,"From one of the most admired and beloved couples in recent American history, an extraordinarily moving story of public service, risk-taking, romance—and the journey toward recovery. This book delivers hope and redemption in the face of the tragic shooting, and introduces two unforgettable heroes.AS INDIVIDUALS, CONGRESSWOMAN GABRIELLE GIFFORDS and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, showed Americans how optimism, an adventurous spirit, and a call to service can help change the world. As a couple, they became a national example of the healing power to be found in deeply shared love and courage. Their arrival in the world spotlight came under the worst of circumstances. On January 8, 2011, while meeting with her constituents in Tucson, Arizona, Gabby was the victim of an assassination attempt that left six people dead and thirteen wounded. Gabby was shot in the head; doctors called her survival “miraculous.” As the nation grieved and sought to understand the attack, Gabby remained in private, focused on her against-all-odds recovery. Mark spent every possible moment by her side, as he also prepared for his final mission as commander of space shuttle Endeavour. Now, as Gabby’s health continues to improve, the couple is sharing their remarkable untold story. Intimate, inspiring, and unforgettably moving, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope provides an unflinching look at the overwhelming challenges of brain injury, the painstaking process of learning to communicate again, and the responsibilities that fall to a loving spouse who wants the best possible treatment for his wife. Told in Mark’s voice and from Gabby’s heart, the book also chronicles the lives that brought these two extraordinary people together—their humor, their ambitions, their sense of duty, their long-distance marriage, and their desire for family. Gabby and Mark made a pledge to tell their account as honestly as possible, and they have done so in riveting detail. Both Gabby and Mark have lived large public lives, but this book takes readers behind many closed doors—from the flight deck of the space shuttle to the cloakrooms of Congress to the hospital wards where Gabby struggled to reclaim herself with the help of formidable medical teams and devoted family and friends. Questions are answered with unvarnished candor. How do Gabby and Mark feel about the angry political discourse that was swirling in America at the time of the shooting, and that remains prevalent today? How do they see government living up to the highest possible ideals? And how do they understand and mourn the loss of the people who did not survive that day? Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope is a reminder of the power of true grit, the patience needed to overcome unimaginable obstacles, and the transcendence of love. In the story of Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly, we all can see the best in ourselves. As Mark and Gabby’s friends have said: “The two of them are America as we dream it can be.”",,,,November 15th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Inspirational', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Space']",,9781451661064,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330113014l/12628536.jpg,4.1,[],85.0,1.0,,12628536-gabby,,,,,95.0,2455.0,320,,Scribner,"['953', '961', '412', '92', '37']",,,[],,

For Maggie declares she is ""cursed."" Undaunted by her admission, N. wants to marry her, so Maggie takes him home to meet her family. But it doesn't take long for N. to realize that something very strange is afoot in Margarettown; for Maggie's family consists of a handful of women -- of varying ages -- each of whom carries a name derived from that of his beloved.Zevin's novel takes several unusual turns as she leads readers on a survey of the many forms of love. Ultimately, the tale is revealed as a kind of diary, which N. has written for his daughter. But the narration changes midstream, and Maggie gets a chance to tell her side of the story before handing it off to the couple's unborn children.

Gadriel Demartinos,"Eternal Darkness, Blood King",,English,,"Get ready for the ultimate showdown between fangs and pure evil!It's evil versus evil when Renzo, a proud immortal, who wonders if there still is some shred of human emotion inside of him, faces an ancient evil force, who seems to be as powerful as he is, with the perfect bait; the secret of how to turn immortals back into mortals in exchange for Renzo's soul. ""Immortality is not easy"" - says Renzo, a vampire, several times in the book more as a warning than an explanation. The fact of conquering death must have a powerful effect inside anyone's mind. How an immortal of any kind could believe in any type of deities, beliefs, myths or any other human concept regarding the afterlife? In the same way, how come someone who defies all laws of nature and those of physics can validate an improbability like that ""it"" we call soul? That's the core of ""Eternal Darkness, Blood King."" From the beginning the story sounds familiar; the vampire with a story to tell, but all similarities end when the plot quickly transforms into something deeper with an array of fascinating characters; like Frank Lopez, a seventy year old alcoholic, cannibal and psychic whose mental power only increases by the consumption of human flesh; specially if it comes from children. Also, Jason Drake and Julia Saravova; Renzo's loyal protégés and eternal twenty something vampires with a taste for violence. Maximilian Hunter; an ex-USMC captain on a man-hunt trying to stop Renzo without fully realizing what he's getting himself into. The young Lucy Buren; a gifted artists and Renzo's business associate who knows the truth about Renzo but refuses to walk away from their friendship. Erika Foster; a tragic teenager with a mysterious past and on a mission. Jean Charles Reneu and Amy Harlow; a pair of millionaire ""collectors"" obsessed with capturing Renzo and unlock the mystery of his immortality, and a tactical unit of mercenaries trying to destroy ""the most dangerous of all creatures"" are the elements of this vampire epic tale. When Renzo decides to accept to trade his soul he asks;""who cares to whom my inexistent soul belongs to when I will go on living forever?” The answer to his question will take the reader to a surprising journey beyond faith, the mysteries of immortality and time itself. ""Eternal Darkness, Blood King"" is a true feast for all vampire lovers, and a new take on the immortal lore with unexpected twists and turns that will leave the reader asking for more.",,First edition,,December 14th 2012,[],ebook,"['Vampires', 'Horror', 'Paranormal']",,9781301796861,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355867879l/17155673.jpg,3.37,[],200.0,2.0,,17155673-eternal-darkness-blood-king,,,,,78.0,46.0,446,,Demar Communications,"['12', '8', '16', '5', '5']",,,[],,

Chairiste alone managed to escape, and now, living in the modern world as Christa Cruitaire, a quiet harp teacher, she is all but resigned to her inability to win her beloved’s freedom . . . until she discovers that the volume and violence of the electric guitar and heavy metal might prove brutal enough to forcibly breach the barriers between the human and fairy worlds.

Gael Baudino,Strands of Starlight,,English,,"""Baudino sets this engrossing fantasy-adventure in a mythical land that replicates the political and religious tensions of 14th-century Europe. The heroine, Miriam, unwillingly gifted with the power to heal, falls victim to a savage Inquisition that condemns her ability as witchcraft, and to a ruthless nobleman who rapes her after she saves his life. Baudino understands the psychology of the persecuted, astutely motivating the self-immolating rage that consumes Miriam and leads her to undergo a complete, magical physical metamorphosis (she becomes tall, strong and beautiful) so that she can be a scourge for her enemies. Though the plot has its share of exciting sword fights, bold rescues and similar stock-in-trade, Baudino focuses on Miriam's interior journey--her spiritual (which accompanies the corporeal) transformation through contact with the uncorrupted Elves, with the pagan priestesses known as witches and with simple Christians. Her tale acquires an elegiac power, mourning the loss of innocent sources of wisdom even as it vividly imagines them.""",Strands #1,,,November 7th 1989,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Feminism', 'Witches', 'Historical Fiction', 'Magic']",,9780451453167,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387664783l/291252.jpg,3.98,[],93.0,1.0,,291252.Strands_of_Starlight,,,,,92.0,701.0,384,,Roc,"['267', '222', '155', '44', '13']",,,[],,

It is also the first time ever that workers have spoken publicly about what’s really taking place behind the closed doors of America’s slaughterhouses. In this new paperback edition, author Gail A. Eisnitz brings the story up to date since the book’s original publication. She describes the ongoing efforts by the Humane Farming Association to improve conditions in the meatpacking industry, media exposés that have prompted reforms resulting in multimillion dollar appropriations by Congress to try to enforce federal inspection laws, and a favorable decision by the Supreme Court to block construction of what was slated to be one of the largest hog factory farms in the country.

But friendship with an Indian girl connects her to a mythology that enriches her landscape; and an unexpected protector shores up her world.

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve.

Gail Tsukiyama,The Street of a Thousand Blossoms,,English,,"
  ""Just remember,"" Yoshio said quietly to his grandsons. ""Every day of your lives, you must always be sure what you're fighting for."" It is Tokyo in 1939. On the Street of a Thousand Blossoms, two orphaned brothers are growing up with their loving grandparents, who inspire them to dream of a future firmly rooted in tradition. The older boy, Hiroshi, shows unusual skill at the national obsession of sumo wrestling, while Kenji is fascinated by the art of creating hard-carved masks for actors in the Noh theater.Across town, a renowned sumo master, Sho Tanaka, lives with his wife and their two young daughters: the delicate, daydreaming Aki and her independent sister, Haru. Life seems full of promise as Kenji begins an informal apprenticeship with the most famous mask-maker in Japan and Hiroshi receives a coveted invitation to train with Tanaka. But then Pearl Harbor changes everything. As the ripples of war spread to both families' quiet neighborhoods, all of the generations must put their dreams on hold---and then find their way in a new Japan.In an exquisitely moving story that spans almost thirty years, Gail Tsukiyama draws us irresistibly into the world of the brothers and the women who love them. It is a world of tradition and change, of heartbreaking loss and surprising hope, and of the impact of events beyond their control on ordinary, decent men and women. Above all, The Street of a Thousand Blossoms is a masterpiece about love and family from a glorious storyteller at the height of her powers.

Wanneer hij deze gebeurtenis vele jaren later in een Engelstalige roman van een zekere Alexander Wolf tot in het kleinste detail beschreven vindt, concludeert hij dat zijn toenmalige achtervolger nog moet leven. Hij doet er alles aan om de mysterieuze auteur van het boek te vinden. Iedereen die hij ontmoet blijkt de schrijver op een andere manier te kennen, en merkwaardig genoeg is ook zijn vriendin Jelena opvallend geïnteresseerd in Wolf. Gajto Gazdanov (1903-1971) meldde zich op zestienjarige leeftijd vrijwillig bij het leger en leerde zo de verschrikkingen van de burgeroorlog kennen. Na een conflict met een meerdere belandde hij via Turkije en Bulgarije in Parijs. Aanvankelijk was hij dakloos, maar al snel vond hij werk en begon hij deel uit te maken van het literaire leven van de Russische ballingen in Frankrijk. Vanaf zijn eerste publicaties werd hij geprezen om zijn talent en in één adem genoemd met onder anderen Vladimir Nabokov.`Wie dit boek leest, houdt daarna nog meer van het leven!

In One Man's Bible, Gao gives us a profound meditation on a life marked by personal and political trauma. The nameless narrator of the novel -- which begins in contemporary Hong Kong -- is clearly Gao himself. In the intimate aftermath of a sexual encounter, Gao revisits the central moments of his life, traveling, in memory, to the Beijing of his childhood, a childhood scarred at the age of ten by his mother's accidental drowning. From emblematic moments like this, Gao's memory ranges across time and space, gradually illuminating the nature of life before, during, and after China's disastrous Cultural Revolution. Gao Xingjian is one of the most eloquent, authoritative voices of 20th-century China, and his personal, political, and aesthetic musings shine a light on a world that very few Westerners have ever truly understood.

While this makes the The Good New Stuff somewhat dubious as a historical overview of the adventure SF field, it allows Dozois to uncover some real gems that might otherwise have gone overlooked, including a couple of stories first published in the Brit-lit SF magazine Interzone. It's safe to say that in the hands of authors like Robert Reed, Walter Jon Williams, and Stephen Baxter, the grand tradition of SF is alive and well. --Craig E.

Garrard Conley (Goodreads Author),"Boy Erased: A Memoir of Identity, Faith, and Family",,English,,"A beautiful, raw and compassionate memoir about identity, love and understanding.   The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality.   When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to “cure” him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness.    By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community.

The chessboard is the ultimate mental battleground and the world champions themselves are supreme intellectual gladiators.This magnificent compilation of chess from the mid-20th century forms the basis of the second part of Garry Kasparov's long-awaited definitive history of the World Chess Championship. Garry Kasparov, who is universally acclaimed as the greatest chess player ever, subjects the play of his early predecessors to a rigorous analysis. This volume features the play of champions Max Euwe (1935-1937) Mikhail Botvinnik (1946-1957, 1958-1961 and 1961-1963), Vassily Smyslov (1957-1958) and Mikhail Tal (1960-1961).However, this book is more than just a compilation of the games of these champions.

"Garry Kasparov, Dmitry Plisetsky (With the participation of), Kenneth P. Neat (Translator)","Garry Kasparov on Fischer: My Great Predecessors, Part IV",,English,,"This book brings together the two greatest names in the history of chess. The author, Garry Kasparov, is the world number one, and by common consent, the greatest player ever. The subject of the book, Bobby Fischer, is the only American to have become world champion and is probably the greatest natural talent the world has ever seen.In the period between 1955 and 1972, Fischer, more or less single-handedly, took on the might of the Soviet Chess Empire and won. During this time Fischer scored astonishing successes, the likes of which had not been seen before. These included 11/11 in the 1963/64 U.S. Championship and match victories (en route to the World Championship) by the score of 6-0 against two of the strongest players in the world, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen. The climax of Fischer's campaign was his unforgettable match win in Reykjavik in 1972 against Boris Spassky.However, Fischer is not only remembered for his achievements over-the-board, he is almost equally well-known for his temperamental behavior away from the board. He made extreme demands of all those around him, including tournament organizers. When these demands were not met he often refused to play. The 1972 match against Spassky required the intervention of no less than Henry Kissinger to smooth things over. In 1975, when he was due to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, Fischer was completely unable to agree terms with FIDE (the World Chess Federation) and was defaulted. After this, he more or less gave up chess, playing only once, a ""return"" match against Spassky in 1992.In this book, a must for all serious chess players, Kasparov deeply analyzes Fischer's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great American genius.",My Great Predecessors #4,,,January 1st 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Chess', 'Games', 'Nonfiction']",,9781857443950,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389215488l/370243.jpg,4.4,['English Chess Federation Book of the Year (2005)'],89.0,1.0,,370243.Garry_Kasparov_on_Fischer,,,,,98.0,213.0,496,,Everyman Chess,"['116', '72', '21', '3', '1']",,,[],,

Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation “a new birth of freedom” in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood.

Built from the spoils of a massive timber fortune, the legendary family mansion is constructed of giant, whole trees, and is set on a huge estate overlooking Puget Sound. Trevor’s bankrupt parents have begun a trial separation, and his father, Jones Riddell, has brought Trevor to Riddell House with a goal: to join forces with his sister, Serena, dispatch Grandpa Samuel—who is flickering in and out of dementia—to a graduated living facility, sell off the house and property for development into “tract housing for millionaires,” divide up the profits, and live happily ever after.But Trevor soon discovers there’s someone else living in Riddell House: a ghost with an agenda of his own. For while the land holds tremendous value, it is also burdened by the final wishes of the family patriarch, Elijah, who mandated it be allowed to return to untamed forestland as a penance for the millions of trees harvested over the decades by the Riddell Timber company. The ghost will not rest until Elijah’s wish is fulfilled, and Trevor’s willingness to face the past holds the key to his family’s future.A Sudden Light is a rich, atmospheric work that is at once a multigenerational family saga, a historical novel, a ghost story, and the story of a contemporary family’s struggle to connect with each other.

They were a quiet people who trusted in the goodness of the Father of Spirits and lived from the fruit of the ground. Because they lived in such close communion with the land, the Peacemakers were a humble people, holding gentleness in high esteem. They were a people made up of many tribes of the old country that had been brought together by the Great Hand of Mercy. In the early days, there were many peoples scattered over the old lands of Ability. Ability lay east of the Triall and was an ever-present reminder to the Peacemakers of the land they were now exiled from. The river was, for the most part, feared by many who wandered in the wilderness; for, it was the great river that had separated them from their homeland. The river was believed to be the curse that kept them estranged from their heritage, thereby keeping them besieged by the evil ways of the Horsemen. Yet, it was this same river which forced them to seek every means possible to live peaceably together. Hence, their namesake. Stephen is a fictional story about a Nomadic Tribe.

On Becoming Babywise brings hope to the tired and bewildered parents looking for an alternative to sleepless nights and fussy babies.

It teaches parents how to lovingly guide their baby's day rather than be guided or enslaved to the infant's unknown needs. The information contained within On Becoming Babywise is loaded with success.

Gary J. Bass,"The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide",,English,,"A riveting history—the first full account—of the involvement of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1971 atrocities in Bangladesh that led to war between India and Pakistan, shaped the fate of Asia, and left in their wake a host of major strategic consequences for the world today.Giving an astonishing inside view of how the White House really works in a crisis, The Blood Telegram is an unprecedented chronicle of a pivotal but little-known chapter of the Cold War. Gary J. Bass shows how Nixon and Kissinger supported Pakistan’s military dictatorship as it brutally quashed the results of a historic free election. The Pakistani army launched a crackdown on what was then East Pakistan (today an independent Bangladesh), killing hundreds of thousands of people and sending ten million refugees fleeing to India—one of the worst humanitarian crises of the twentieth century.Nixon and Kissinger, unswayed by detailed warnings of genocide from American diplomats witnessing the bloodshed, stood behind Pakistan’s military rulers. Driven not just by Cold War realpolitik but by a bitter personal dislike of India and its leader Indira Gandhi, Nixon and Kissinger actively helped the Pakistani government even as it careened toward a devastating war against India. They silenced American officials who dared to speak up, secretly encouraged China to mass troops on the Indian border, and illegally supplied weapons to the Pakistani military—an overlooked scandal that presages Watergate.Drawing on previously unheard White House tapes, recently declassified documents, and extensive interviews with White House staffers and Indian military leaders, The Blood Telegram tells this thrilling, shadowy story in full. Bringing us into the drama of a crisis exploding into war, Bass follows reporters, consuls, and guerrilla warriors on the ground—from the desperate refugee camps to the most secretive conversations in the Oval Office. Bass makes clear how the United States’ embrace of the military dictatorship in Islamabad would mold Asia’s destiny for decades, and confronts for the first time Nixon and Kissinger’s hidden role in a tragedy that was far bloodier than Bosnia. This is a revelatory, compulsively readable work of politics, personalities, military confrontation, and Cold War brinksmanship. ",,,,September 24th 2013,"['Richard Nixon', 'Henry Kissinger']",Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'War', 'Bangladesh', 'Asia', 'American History', 'World History']",,9780307700209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1363836984l/17262102.jpg,4.33,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2014)', 'Lionel Gelber Prize (2014)', 'Arthur Ross Book Award for Gold Medal (2014)', 'Robert H.

As he lay dying, his priest, family, and friends offered him a last chance to confess his mendacity, and Marco, it is said, replied ""I have not told the half of what I saw and did."" Now Gary Jennings has imagined the half that Marco left unsaid as even more elaborate and adventurous than the tall tales thought to be lies. From the palazzi and back streets of medieval Venice to the sumptuous court of Kublai Khan, from the perfumed sexuality of the Levant to the dangers and rigors of travel along the Silk Road, Marco meets all manner of people, survives all manner of danger, and, insatiably curious, becomes an almost compulsive collector of customs, languages and women.In more than two decades of travel, Marco was variously a merchant, a warrior, a lover, a spy, even a tax collector - but always a journeyer, unflagging in his appetite for new experiences, regretting only what he missed. Here - recreated and reimagined with all the splendor, the love of adventure, the zest for the rare and curious that are Jennings's hallmarks - is the epic account, at once magnificent and delightful, of the greatest real-life adventurer in human history.",,,10/28/84,June 27th 2006,['Marco Polo'],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Adventure', 'Travel', 'Asia', 'Fantasy', 'China', 'Medieval', 'Novels']",,9780765349644,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388231815l/79155.jpg,4.32,[],455.0,5.0,,79155.The_Journeyer,,,,,95.0,3363.0,1024,,Forge Books,"['1831', '964', '415', '109', '44']",,,['Venice (Italy)'],,

Gary Paul Stephenson (Goodreads Author),The Pacific Depths,,English,,"KIRKUS REVIEWA billionaire’s attempts to make profound changes to counter global problems such as climate change are met with severe resistance from the U.S. president in Stephenson’s debut thriller.New Zealander Charles Langham, at a United Nations meeting, implores the U.N. to take more active roles in combating famine and the deforestation of rain forests and promoting alternative fuels. This plea includes a vague warning, giving the U.N. a week to comply or Charles will take action. It seems that U.S. President Mike Read, who views Charles as a threat to the American economy, may be the billionaire’s biggest adversary. President Read sends a U.S. ship after Charles’ superyacht, Sundancer, presumably to attack, and Charles responds by disabling the vessel with an electromagnetic pulse fired from one of his subs. Charles then makes a statement to the public that he plans to use a device to create two tsunamis (designed to inflict only “minor damage”)to hit the U.S., but Read soon sends a covert team to eliminate Charles. The novel embraces its climate change message by directly addressing the issue, and its suggested solution—Charles sends specialists to countries to help the people become self-reliant—is both practical and feasible within the novel’s context. America initially is the villain, but as the story progresses, it’s clear that the true antagonist is President Read, who gradually loses the support of other nations and even his own advisers. The bulk of the novel is essentially a showdown between Read and Charles, who seemingly has enough money and employees to be a viable opponent for a man who leads a country. There’s very little suspense, however, as Charles is never in any real danger; he’s protected by boats, submarines, “extremely well paid” security teams and a deep-sea HQ. He supplements his story by moving beyond the U.S. situation, including Charles’ team making a strike against a drug cartel in Brazil, and spotlighting strong characters—although the book is nearly stolen by Abbey, Charles’ border collie, who has more personality than his children, Cathy and Chris.Charles isn’t terribly charismatic, but his integrity and seemingly endless resources make for a great read.",,,,April 25th 2014,[],ebook,[],,9781493137992,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410494815l/23203724.jpg,4.07,[],100.0,1.0,,23203724-the-pacific-depths,,,,,93.0,15.0,226,,Xlibris Corporation,"['6', '5', '3', '1', '0']",,,[],,

His hatchet and knife would have done nothing more than make the bear really angry -- something he did not like to think about -- and his bow was good only for smaller game. He had never tried to shoot anything bigger than a fool bird or rabbit with it and doubted that the bow would push the arrow deep enough to do anything but -- again -- make the bear really mad. He bundled in his bag that night, the end of the two weeks of warm weather. He kept putting wood on the fire, half afraid the bear would come back. All the while he tried to think of a solution. But in reality, the bear was not his primary adversary. Nor was the wolf, nor any animal. Brian had become his own worst enemy because in all the business of hunting, fishing and surviving he had forgotten the primary rule: Always, always pay attention to what was happening. Everything in nature means something and he had missed the warnings that summer was ending, had in many ways already ended, and what was coming would be the most dangerous thing he had faced since the plane crashed.",Brian's Saga #3,,01/01/96,January 12th 1998,['Brian Robeson'],Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Adventure', 'Survival', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Classics', 'Action', 'Teen']",,9780440227199,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438636861l/141372._SY475_.jpg,4.02,['Iowa Teen Award (1998)'],80.0,1.0,,141372.Brian_s_Winter,,,,,94.0,25747.0,144,,Laurel Leaf,"['9329', '9359', '5617', '1078', '364']",,,['Canada'],,

He has stood up to the challenge of surviving alone in the woods. He prefers being on his own in the natural world to civilization.

Gary Paulsen,Hatchet,,English,,"Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive.

Gary Shteyngart (Goodreads Author),Super Sad True Love Story,,English,,"The author of two critically acclaimed novels, The Russian Debutante’s Handbook and Absurdistan, Gary Shteyngart has risen to the top of the fiction world. Now, in his hilarious and heartfelt new novel, he envisions a deliciously dark tale of America’s dysfunctional coming years—and the timeless and tender feelings that just might bring us back from the brink.In a very near future—oh, let’s say next Tuesday—a functionally illiterate America is about to collapse. But don’t that tell that to poor Lenny Abramov, the thirty-nine-year-old son of an angry Russian immigrant janitor, proud author of what may well be the world’s last diary, and less-proud owner of a bald spot shaped like the great state of Ohio. Despite his job at an outfit called Post-Human Services, which attempts to provide immortality for its super-rich clientele, death is clearly stalking this cholesterol-rich morsel of a man. And why shouldn’t it? Lenny’s from a different century—he totally loves books (or “printed, bound media artifacts,” as they’re now known), even though most of his peers find them smelly and annoying. But even more than books, Lenny loves Eunice Park, an impossibly cute and impossibly cruel twenty-four-year-old Korean American woman who just graduated from Elderbird College with a major in Images and a minor in Assertiveness.After meeting Lenny on an extended Roman holiday, blistering Eunice puts that Assertiveness minor to work, teaching our “ancient dork” effective new ways to brush his teeth and making him buy a cottony nonflammable wardrobe. But America proves less flame-resistant than Lenny’s new threads. The country is crushed by a credit crisis, riots break out in New York’s Central Park, the city’s streets are lined with National Guard tanks on every corner, the dollar is so over, and our patient Chinese creditors may just be ready to foreclose on the whole mess. Undeterred, Lenny vows to love both Eunice and his homeland. He’s going to convince his fickle new love that in a time without standards or stability, in a world where single people can determine a dating prospect’s “hotness” and “sustainability” with the click of a button, in a society where the privileged may live forever but the unfortunate will die all too soon, there is still value in being a real human being.Wildly funny, rich, and humane, Super Sad True Love Story is a knockout novel by a young master, a book in which falling in love just may redeem a planet falling apart. ",,,07/06/10,July 27th 2010,"['Leonard Abramov', 'Eunice Park']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'Adult Fiction', 'American', 'Literature']",,9781400066407,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320540909l/7334201.jpg,3.45,"['Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize Nominee for Comic Fiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2010)']",89.0,1.0,,7334201-super-sad-true-love-story,,,,,81.0,38049.0,331,,Random House Publishing Group,"['6748', '12856', '11293', '4949', '2203']",,,"['Lower East Side, New York City, New York (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', 'Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)']",,

Gary Taubes (Goodreads Author),Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It,,English,,"
  [image]
An eye-opening, myth-shattering examination of what makes us fat, from acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes.In his New York Times best seller, Good Calories, Bad Calories, Taubes argued that our diet’s overemphasis on certain kinds of carbohydrates—not fats and not simply excess calories—has led directly to the obesity epidemic we face today. The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, Good Calories, Bad Calories immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as “a vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.” Building upon this critical work in Good Calories, Bad Calories and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what’s making us fat—and how we can change—in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, Why We Get Fat makes Taubes’s crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience.Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the “calories-in, calories-out” model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin’s regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, Why We Get Fat is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it.",,,,December 28th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Health', 'Food', 'Science', 'Nutrition', 'Self Help', 'Diets', 'Fitness', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']",,9780307272706,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320563681l/8727466.jpg,4.05,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Food & Cooking (2011)'],155.0,2.0,,8727466-why-we-get-fat,,,,,93.0,19140.0,272,,Knopf,"['7413', '6925', '3461', '940', '401']",,,[],,

Gary Taubes (Goodreads Author),"Good Calories, Bad Calories",,English,,"Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight, and DiseaseIn this groundbreaking book, the result of seven years of research in every science connected with the impact of nutrition on health, award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less and exercising more. Yet with more and more people acting on this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates (white flour, sugar, easily digested starches) and sugars–via their dramatic and longterm effects on insulin, the hormone that regulates fat accumulation–and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. There are good calories, and bad ones.Good CaloriesThese are from foods without easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. These foods can be eaten without restraint.Meat, fish, fowl, cheese, eggs, butter, and non-starchy vegetables. Bad CaloriesThese are from foods that stimulate excessive insulin secretion and so make us fat and increase our risk of chronic disease—all refined and easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. The key is not how much vitamins and minerals they contain, but how quickly they are digested. (So apple juice or even green vegetable juices are not necessarily any healthier than soda.) Bread and other baked goods, potatoes, yams, rice, pasta, cereal grains, corn, sugar (sucrose and high fructose corn syrup), ice cream, candy, soft drinks, fruit juices, bananas and other tropical fruits, and beer. Taubes traces how the common assumption that carbohydrates are fattening was abandoned in the 1960s when fat and cholesterol were blamed for heart disease and then –wrongly–were seen as the causes of a host of other maladies, including cancer. He shows us how these unproven hypotheses were emphatically embraced by authorities in nutrition, public health, and clinical medicine, in spite of how well-conceived clinical trials have consistently refuted them. He also documents the dietary trials of carbohydrate-restriction, which consistently show that the fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. With precise references to the most significant existing clinical studies, he convinces us that there is no compelling scientific evidence demonstrating that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease, that salt causes high blood pressure, and that fiber is a necessary part of a healthy diet. Based on the evidence that does exist, he leads us to conclude that the only healthy way to lose weight and remain lean is to eat fewer carbohydrates or to change the type of the carbohydrates we do eat, and, for some of us, perhaps to eat virtually none at all.The 11 Critical Conclusions of Good Calories, Bad Calories: 1. Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, does not cause heart disease. 2. Carbohydrates do, because of their effect on the hormone insulin. The more easily-digestible and refined the carbohydrates and the more fructose they contain, the greater the effect on our health, weight, and well-being. 3. Sugars—sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup specifically—are particularly harmful. The glucose in these sugars raises insulin levels; the fructose they contain overloads the liver.4. Refined carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are also the most likely dietary causes of cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, and the other common chronic diseases of modern times. 5. Obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation, not overeating and not sedentary behavior. 6. Consuming excess calories does not cause us to grow fatter any more than it causes a child to grow taller. 7. Exercise does not make us lose excess fat; it makes us hungry. 8. We get fat because of an imbalance—a disequilibrium—in the hormonal regulation of fat tissue and fat metabolism. More fat is stored in the fat tissue than is mobilized and used for fuel. We become leaner when the hormonal regulation of the fat tissue reverses this imbalance. 9. Insulin is the primary regulator of fat storage. When insulin levels are elevated, we stockpile calories as fat. When insulin levels fall, we release fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel. 10. By stimulating insulin secretion, carbohydrates make us fat and ultimately cause obesity. By driving fat accumulation, carbohydrates also increase hunger and decrease the amount of energy we expend in metabolism and physical activity.11. The fewer carbohydrates we eat, the leaner we will be. Good Calories, Bad Calories is a tour de force of scientific investigation–certain to redefine the ongoing debate about the foods we eat and their effects on our health.From the Hardcover edition.",,,08/05/04,September 23rd 2008,[],Paperback,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Nutrition', 'Science', 'Fitness', 'Diets', 'Cooking', 'Medicine', 'Self Help']",,9781400033461,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348003139l/2442529.jpg,4.18,[],97.0,1.0,,2442529.Good_Calories_Bad_Calories,,,,,94.0,8833.0,634,,Anchor,"['4187', '2745', '1344', '385', '172']",,,[],,

Gary Zukav,Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics (Perennial Classics),,English,,"Gary Zukav has written ""the Bible"" for those who are curious about the mind-expanding discoveries of advanced physics, but who have no scientific background. Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language—with no mathematical equations—opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, ""patterns of organic energy."" Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further: The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The ""new physics"" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction. The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. --Mary Ellen Curtin",,,03/29/79,August 1st 2001,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics', 'Popular Science', 'New Age', 'Quantum Mechanics']",,9780060959685,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410138626l/64794.jpg,3.97,['National Book Award for Science (Paperback) (1980)'],230.0,3.0,,64794.Dancing_Wu_Li_Masters,,,,,92.0,10105.0,416,,Perennial Classics,"['3780', '3446', '2030', '535', '314']",,,[],,
Gary Zukav,The Seat of the Soul,,English,," A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: This hardcover edition of The Seat of the Soul celebrates its tenth anniversary. The Seat of the Soul became a national bestseller when it was first published, but more people are buying it now than ever before. Why is this?  It is because a new species is being born. The Seat of the Soul is about this birth. This new species longs for harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for Life. It uses higher orders of logic and justice -- those of the heart. The number of people who are becoming aware of this birth is growing very fast, because the new species is being born inside all of us.  The Seat of the Soul provides a vocabulary for this new species -- a vocabulary of authentic power, the alignment of the personality with the soul. Human experience is exploding beyond the five senses, and The Seat of the Soul is about that, too. This is the most exciting time to be on Earth, and The Seat of the Soul describes why.  As we become aware of our new abilities and values, like a baby opening its eyes and stretching its arms and legs for the first time, we are also becoming aware of an entirely new potential that we have never had before. I have been writing a book about this new potential for nine years. I am looking forward to sharing that with you, too.  The tremendous growth of interest in The Seat of the Soul is humbling to me. I dream of a world where people respect each other and the living Earth, and spiritual growth is the first priority. I work daily to develop the awareness, compassion, and intentions that are necessary to create it. The extraordinary reception of The Seat of the Soul shows me, among other things, how many fellow souls are doing the same.  The more this happens, the more I see myself, with gratitude, as a traveler among travelers, an experimenter among experimenters, and a soul among souls.

Gaston Bachelard,The Flame of a Candle,,English,,"""This book further-cements his thematic contention that the imagination is a flame, the flame of the psyche."" - Joanne Stroud. Chapters include ""Poetic Images of the Flame in Plant Life,"" ''The Solitude of the Candle Dreamer,"" and ""The Light of the Lamp."" THE BACHELARD TRANSLATIONS are the inspiration of Joanne H. Stroud, Director of Publications for The Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture, who in 1981 contracted with Jose Corti to publish in English the untranslated works of Bachelard on the imagination. Gaston Bachelard is acclaimed as one of the most significant modern French thinkers. From 1929 to 1962 he authored twenty-three books addressing his dual concerns, the philosophy of science and the analysis of the imagination of matter. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities - art, architecture, literature, language, poetics, philosophy, and depth psychology. His teaching career included posts at the College de Bar-sur-Aube, the University of Dijon, and from 1940 to 1962 the chair of history and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. One of the amphitheaters of the Sorbonne is called ""L'Amphi Gaston Bachelard,"" an honor Bachelard shared with Descartes and Richelieu. He received the Grand Prix National Lettres in 1961-one of only three philosophers ever to have achieved this honor. The influence of his thought can be felt in all disciplines of the humanities-art, architecture, literature, poetics, psychology, philosophy, and language.",,,11/06/61,February 28th 2012,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Psychology', 'Literature', 'French Literature']",,9780911005158,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356092314l/437010.jpg,3.92,[],65.0,1.0,,437010.The_Flame_of_a_Candle,,,,,91.0,202.0,110,,Dallas Institute Publications,"['67', '74', '43', '14', '4']",,,[],,

When her locked door is finally broken down by her father and a servant, they find the woman on the floor, badly hurt and bleeding. No one else is in the room. There is no other exit except through a barred window. How did the attacker escape?First published in 1907, this intriguing and baffling tale is a classic of early 20th-century detective fiction. At the heart of the novel is a perplexing mystery: How could a crime take place in a locked room which shows no sign of being entered? Nearly a century after its initial publication, Leroux's landmark tale of foul play, deception, and unbridled ambition remains a blueprint for the detective novel genre.

Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations.

Gautam Malkani,Londonstani,,English,,"Jas is in trouble. Because of who he is-an eighteen-year-old Asian living in London. Because of the gang he hangs out with. And because of the woman he fancies, Samira, who Jas shouldn't have taken a shining to because she is, as his pals point out, not one of his own. He's in trouble because his education, never mind his career, is going nowhere. And he's fallen into the schemes, games and prejudices of his friends on the streets of the big western city in which he lives. But Jas's main trouble is Jas himself, and he doesn't even know the trouble he's in, and try as hard as he does, he's failing to make sense of what it is to be young, male and what you might say is Indostani in a city that professes to be a melting pot but is a city of racial and religious exclusion zones. Without his parents' aspirations to assimilate, without the gifts of his more academically accomplished contemporaries, Jas is a young man without a survival plan to get by in the big city. He's out of touch, an anachronism posing as young man who's up-to-date, living free-style, making things up as he goes along in suburbs of West London.  Gautam Malkani's extraordinary comic novel portrays the lives of young Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu men in the ethnically charged enclave of one of the biggest western cities, London. A world usually-but wrongly-portrayed as the breeding ground for Islamic militants is, in actuality, a world of money (sometimes), flash cars (usually), cell phones (all the time), rap music and MTV, as well as rivalries and feuds, and the small-time crooks who exploit them. In Malkani's hilarious depiction of multiculturalism, race is no more than a proxy for masculinity, or lack of masculinity, among young men struggling to get by in a remorseless city. Just as Martin Amis and Irving Welsh captured the mood and the ethos of the eighties and nighties, twenty-nine-year-old Gautam Malkani brilliantly evokes the life of immigrants who are not immigrants in Londonstani, bringing an entirely fresh perspective to contemporary fiction as he does so.",,,10/28/06,June 22nd 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'India', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Asia', 'Cultural', 'Modern', 'Race']",,9781594200977,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309288159l/386347.jpg,3.35,['Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης ΕΚΕΜΕΛ Nominee for Αγγλόφωνη Λογοτεχνία (2008)'],265.0,3.0,,386347.Londonstani,,,,,80.0,1512.0,342,,Penguin Press,"['231', '440', '543', '216', '82']",,,['United Kingdom'],,
Gavan Daws,Prisoners of the Japanese,,English,,"Gavan Daws combined ten years of documentary research and hundreds of interviews with POWs on three continents to write this shattering re-creation of the experience of Allied POWs of the Second World War in the Pacific -- British, Australian, American and Dutch. The Japanese army took over 140,000 military prisoners, and one in four died at the hands of their captors. Drawing directly on the vivid memories of the survivors, Daws brings the reader heart-breakingly close to the atrocities of the Burma--Siam railway and the Bataan death march, the horrors of Japanese medical experiments, the struggles of POWs to stay alive and remain human, the permanent scars that the survivors carry, and the incomprehensible refusal of their own governments to support their attempts to get an apology from Japan. Daws' account, which was neither researched nor written under military auspices, is the humanly indispensable reverse side of official history.

Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,An Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization,,English,,"During the past twenty years, the world’s most renowned critical theorist—the scholar who defined the field of postcolonial studies—has experienced a radical reorientation in her thinking. Finding the neat polarities of tradition and modernity, colonial and postcolonial, no longer sufficient for interpreting the globalized present, she turns elsewhere to make her central argument: that aesthetic education is the last available instrument for implementing global justice and democracy.Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s unwillingness to sacrifice the ethical in the name of the aesthetic, or to sacrifice the aesthetic in grappling with the political, makes her task formidable. As she wrestles with these fraught relationships, she rewrites Friedrich Schiller’s concept of play as double bind, reading Gregory Bateson with Gramsci as she negotiates Immanuel Kant, while in dialogue with her teacher Paul de Man. Among the concerns Spivak addresses is this: Are we ready to forfeit the wealth of the world’s languages in the name of global communication? “Even a good globalization (the failed dream of socialism) requires the uniformity which the diversity of mother-tongues must challenge,” Spivak writes. “The tower of Babel is our refuge.”In essays on theory, translation, Marxism, gender, and world literature, and on writers such as Assia Djebar, J. M. Coetzee, and Rabindranath Tagore, Spivak argues for the social urgency of the humanities and renews the case for literary studies, imprisoned in the corporate university. “Perhaps,” she writes, “the literary can still do something.”",,,,February 27th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Education', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Post Colonial', 'Politics', 'Feminism', 'Womens']",,9780674051836,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328044833l/13373822.jpg,4.05,[],100.0,1.0,,13373822-an-aesthetic-education-in-the-era-of-globalization,,,,,91.0,57.0,607,,Harvard University Press,"['22', '21', '9', '5', '0']",,,[],,

The one where you know you're not crazy, but no one around you--not your parents, not your teachers, not even the authorities--will listen to you? For sixteen-year-old Brit Hemphill, the out-of-control dream comes true when her dad enrolls her at Red Rock, a bogus treatment center that claims to cure rebellious teen girls. At Red Rock, Brit is forced into therapy, and her only hope of getting her life back is in the hands of an underqualified staff of counselors. Brit's dad thinks Red Rock can save her, but the truth is it's doing more harm than good. No girl could survive Red Rock alone--but at a treatment center where you earn privileges for ratting out your peers, it's hard to know who you can trust.

Geert Mak,In Europa,,Dutch,,"Verschenen in 2004 - Geert Mak reisde met de twintigste eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl.Wat heeft een straatarme, tandeloze bejaarde in een afgelegen, vervallen dorpje in Roemenië gemeen met de bewoner van een Hollandse nieuwbouwwijk, hybride auto voor de deur, golfset in de gang? Niet veel – maar ze wonen wel allebei in een land dat deel uitmaakt van Europa. Binnen de grenzen van dat continent lijken de verschillende tijdlagen soms als kruiend ijs over elkaar te schuiven: de ene plaats geeft je het gevoel dat de tijd heeft stilgestaan, op andere plekken vallen de vernieuwingen niet bij te benen.In 1999, vlak voordat er weer een hoofdstuk van een eeuw Europa ten einde zou gaan, maakte Geert Mak in opdracht van NRCHandelsblad een reis door die oude wereld. Zijn doel: ‘een soort eindinspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het slot van de twintigste eeuw?’ Tegelijk was het een ‘historische reis’: ‘ik volgde, voor zover mogelijk, de loop van de geschiedenis, op zoek naar sporen die waren achtergebleven.’ De inhoudsopgave van het boek bestaat uit een indrukwekkende lijst plaatsen waar geschiedenis is geschreven: Verdun, Ieper, Berlijn, Predappio, Leningrad, Vichy, Neurenberg, Lourdes, Tsjernobyl en Novi Sad, om er een paar te noemen. Overal bezocht Mak plaatsen van herinnering, hij dook in archieven en sprak met schrijvers, historici, filosofen, politici, verzetslieden en militairen, maar ook met hele gewone mensen die over hun leven vertelden. Al die gesprekken, al die documenten, al die boeken, ze hebben geleid tot een imposant verhaal over een eeuw Europa, een werelddeel dat wel één naam draagt maar nooit echt een eenheid was. En hoe kan het anders, gezien de totaal verschillende culturen binnen de grenzen ervan en het gegeven dat het gelijktijdige zo ongelijk kan zijn – niet lang geleden nog heel schrijnend, toen er in Joegoslavië, op twee uurtjes vliegen afstand van het kalme, nijvere Nederland, een burgeroorlog uitbrak.De twintigste eeuw is verleden tijd, geschiedenis. Er woedden oorlogen, de Muur viel, er kwam een Europese munt. In de machtige studie die In Europa is, maken we het allemaal nog een keer mee, vaak via verhalen uit de eerste hand, via ooggetuigenverslagen. Dat het daarbij lijkt dat de chaos toeneemt naarmate we het heden naderen, maakt deel uit van de paradox van de geschiedenis: hoe verder een tijdvak uit het zicht verdwijnt, hoe scherper het beeld zich toont. Maks boek is een fascinerend mozaïek van verhalen en geschiedenissen, waar we later, op grotere afstand, misschien heel nieuwe patronen in zullen ontwaren.`Begin 1999 verliet ik Amsterdam voor een reis door Europa die een vol jaar zou duren. Het was een soort laatste inspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het eind van de twintigste eeuw? Maar het was ook een historische reis: ik volgde letterlijk de sporen van de geschiedenis, door de eeuw en door het continent, beginnend in januari, bij de resten van de Parijse Wereldtentoonstelling en het bruisende Wenen, eindigend in december, in de ruïnes van Sarajevo.Dat hele jaar reisde ik zo met de eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl. En ik praatte met de getuigen: met schrijvers en politici, met verzetsmensen en hoge offi cie ren, met een boer in de Pyreneeën en met de kleinzoon van de Duitse keizer, tientallen Europeanen die hun verhaal op tafel legden.Dit reisverslag gaat over het verleden, en wat het verleden met ons doet. Het gaat over ver­scheurd heid en onwetendheid, over historie en angst, over armoede en hoop, over alles wat ons nieuwe Europa scheidt en bindt.' - Geert Mak",,Herziene editie met nieuw nawoord,10/30/04,November 2007,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Historical', 'Society', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'War', '20th Century', 'Unfinished']",,9789045003726,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1286468201l/9470575.jpg,4.34,"['Publieksprijs voor het Nederlandse Boek (2004)', 'Bob den Uyl Prijs Nominee (2005)', 'Leipzig Book Award for European Understanding (2008)']",98.0,1.0,,9470575-in-europa,,,,,98.0,3283.0,853,,Atlas,"['1595', '1305', '312', '48', '23']",,,[],,

"Gendün Chöphel, Donald S. Lopez Jr. (Translator)","In the Forest of Faded Wisdom: 104 Poems by Gendun Chopel, a Bilingual Edition",,English,,"In a culture where poetry is considered the highest form of human language, Gendun Chopel is revered as Tibet’s greatest modern poet. Born in 1903 as British troops were preparing to invade his homeland, Gendun Chopel was identified at any early age as the incarnation of a famous lama and became a Buddhist monk, excelling in the debating courtyards of the great monasteries of Tibet. At the age of thirty-one, he gave up his monk’s vows and set off for India, where he would wander, often alone and impoverished, for over a decade. Returning to Tibet, he was arrested by the government of the young Dalai Lama on trumped-up charges of treason, emerging from prison three years later a broken man. He died in 1951 as troops of the People’s Liberation Army marched into Lhasa.Throughout his life, from his childhood to his time in prison, Gendun Chopel wrote poetry that conveyed the events of his remarkable life. In the Forest of Faded Wisdom is the first comprehensive collection of his oeuvre in any language, assembling poems in both the original Tibetan and in English translation. A master of many forms of Tibetan verse, Gendun Chopel composed heartfelt hymns to the Buddha, pithy instructions for the practice of the dharma, stirring tributes to the Tibetan warrior-kings, cynical reflections on the ways of the world, and laments of a wanderer, forgotten in a foreign land. These poems exhibit the technical skill—wordplay, puns, the ability to evoke moods of pathos and irony—for which Gendun Chopel was known and reveal the poet to be a consummate craftsman, skilled in both Tibetan and Indian poetics. With a directness and force often at odds with the conventions of belles lettres, this is a poetry that is at once elegant and earthy. In the Forest of Faded Wisdom is a remarkable introduction to Tibet’s sophisticated poetic tradition and its most intriguing twentieth-century writer.",,,06/15/09,November 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Buddhism']",,9780226104522,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348208062l/6085994.jpg,4.11,[],86.0,1.0,,6085994-in-the-forest-of-faded-wisdom,,,,,94.0,18.0,199,,University of Chicago Press,"['8', '5', '4', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Gene Baur (Goodreads Author),Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food,,English,,"Leading animal rights activist Gene Baur examines the real cost of the meat on our plates -- for both humans and animals alike -- in this provocative and thorough examination of the modern farm industry. Many people picture cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens as friendly creatures who live happily within the confines of a peaceful family farm, arriving as food for humans only at the end of their sun-drenched lives. That's what Gene Baur had been told -- but when he first visited a stockyard he realized that this rosy depiction couldn't be more inaccurate. Amid the stench, noise, and filth, his attention was drawn in particular to one sheep who had been cast aside for dead. But as Baur walked by, the sheep raised her head and looked right at him. She was still alive, and the one thing Baur knew for sure that day was that he had to get her to safety. Hilda, as she was later named, was nursed back to health and soon became the first resident of Farm Sanctuary -- an organization dedicated to the rescue, care, and protection of farm animals. The truth is that farm production does not depend on the family farmer with a small herd of animals but instead resembles a large, assembly-line factory. Animals raised for human consumption are confined for the entirety of their lives and often live without companionship, fresh air, or even adequate food and water.Viewed as production units rather than living beings with feelings, ten billion farm animals are exploited specifically for food in the United States every year. In Farm Sanctuary, Baur provides a thoughtprovoking investigation of the ethical questions involved in the production of beef, poultry, pork, milk,and eggs -- and what each of us can do to stop the mistreatment of farm animals and promote compassion. He details the triumphs and the disappointments of more than twenty years on the front lines of the animal protection movement.

Gene Edward Veith Jr. (Goodreads Author),Reading Between the Lines,,English,,"Here is a guidebook for those who want to learn how to recognize books that are spiritually and aesthetically good–to cultivate good literary taste. Gene Edward Veith presents basic information to help book lovers understand what they read–from the classics to the bestsellers. He explains how the major genres of literature communicate. He explores ways comedy, tragedy, realism, and fantasy can portray the Christian worldview. These discussions lead to a host of related topics—the value of fairy tales for children, the tragic and the comic sense of life, the interplay between Greek and Biblical concepts in the imagination, and the new ""post-modernism"" (a subject of vital importance to Christians).In the pages of this book, readers will meet writers, past and present who carry on a great literary tradition. By supporting worthy authors, Christians can exert a powerful influence on their culture.""What a superb resource this is! It resonates with profound perceptions of how good literature works to enrich and illuminate us. Dr. Veith proves himself once again to be a knowledgeable guide through the landscape of the written word."" —Luci Shaw, author of God in the Dark and Polishing the Petoskey Stone""Veith makes it clear that the joys of reading can be deep joys of the type which can enliven our souls.

Gene Edward Veith Jr. (Goodreads Author),God at Work: Your Christian Vocation in All of Life,,English,,"When you understand it properly, the doctrine of vocation—""doing everything for God's glory""—is not a platitude or an outdated notion. This principle that we vaguely apply to our lives and our work is actually the key to Christian ethics, to influencing our culture for Christ, and to infusing our ordinary, everyday lives with the presence of God. For when we realize that the ""mundane"" activities that consume most of our time are ""God's hiding places,"" our perspective changes.Culture expert Gene Veith unpacks the biblical, Reformation teaching about the doctrine of vocation, emphasizing not what we should specifically do with our time or what careers we are called to, but what God does in and through our callings—even within the home. In each task He has given us—in our workplaces and families, our churches and society—God Himself is at work. Veith guides you to discover God's purpose and calling in those seemingly ordinary areas by providing you with a spiritual framework for thinking about such issues and for acting upon them with a changed perspective.",,,,March 22nd 2002,[],Paperback,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Christianity', 'Cultural', 'Faith', 'Personal Development']",,9781581344035,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924364l/255685.jpg,4.01,[],93.0,1.0,,255685.God_at_Work,,,,,95.0,639.0,176,,Crossway Books,"['222', '245', '137', '25', '10']",,,[],,

"Gene Roberts, Hank Klibanoff","The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation",,English,,"This is the story of how America awakened to its race problem, of how a nation that longed for unity after World War II came instead to see, hear, and learn about the shocking indignities and injustices of racial segregation in the South—and the brutality used to enforce it. It is the story of how the nation’s press, after decades of ignoring the problem, came to recognize the importance of the civil rights struggle and turn it into the most significant domestic news event of the twentieth century.Drawing on private correspondence, notes from secret meetings, unpublished articles, and interviews, veteran journalists Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff go behind the headlines and datelines to show how a dedicated cadre of newsmen—first black reporters, then liberal southern editors, then reporters and photographers from the national press and the broadcast media—revealed to a nation its most shameful shortcomings and propelled its citizens to act. We watch the black press move bravely into the front row of the confrontation, only to be attacked and kept away from the action. Following the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision striking down school segregation and the South’s mobilization against it, we see a growing number of white reporters venture South to cover the Emmett Till murder trial, the Montgomery bus boycott, and the integration of the University of Alabama. We witness some southern editors joining the call for massive resistance and working with segregationist organizations to thwart compliance. But we also see a handful of other southern editors write forcefully and daringly for obedience to federal mandates, signaling to the nation that moderate forces were prepared to push the region into the mainstream.The pace quickens in Little Rock, where reporters test the boundaries of journalistic integrity, then gain momentum as they cover shuttered schools in Virginia, sit-ins in North Carolina, mob-led riots in Mississippi, Freedom Ride buses being set afire, fire hoses and dogs in Birmingham, and long, tense marches through the rural South. For many journalists, the conditions they found, the fear they felt, and the violence they saw were transforming. Their growing disgust matched the mounting countrywide outrage as The New York Times, Newsweek, NBC News, and other major news organizations, many of them headed by southerners, turned a regional story into a national drama.Meticulously researched and vividly rendered, The Race Beat is an unprecedented account of one of the most volatile periods in our nation’s history, as told by those who covered it.",,,,October 31st 2006,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Journalism', 'Race', 'American History', 'Politics', 'African American', 'Historical', 'Social Justice', 'American']",,9780679403814,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320445224l/108422.jpg,4.21,"['Pulitzer Prize for History (2007)', 'Goldsmith Book Prize for Trade (2007)', 'PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction Nominee (2007)']",70.0,1.0,,108422.The_Race_Beat,,,,,95.0,1447.0,528,,Knopf,"['687', '474', '207', '56', '23']",,,[],,

Gene Stratton-Porter,A Girl of the Limberlost,,English,,"Set amid Indiana's vast Limberlost Swamp, this treasured children's classic mixes astute observations on nature with the struggles of growing up in the early 20th century. Harassed by her mother and scorned by her peers, Elnora Comstock finds solace in natural beauty along with friendship, independence, and romance.--Synopsis from Huffington Post: Cornfields, soy fields, alfalfa fields ― Indiana has long been seen as an agricultural plain. But to make it a lucrative farming state, much of the land had to be deforested, leaving behind devastated habitats. The Limberlost, a wetland in northern Indiana, was mostly destroyed by drainage, logging and oil production. Gene Stratton-Porter, an early 20th-century naturalist and novelist, captured the fading beauty of the swamp in books like A Girl of the Limberlost, a novel about a smart, ambitious girl who lives in the dwindling wetland with her mother and pays for school by collecting local moth specimens to sell to naturalists.

In a world like that, how will we and our children achieve a rising standard of living?The real issue is what we humans are hardwired to do for and with one another, arising from our deepest, most essentially human abilities—empathy, social sensitivity, storytelling, humor, forming relationships, creativity. These are how we create value that all people hunger for, that is unique and not easily quantified.Individuals and companies are already discovering that these high-value abilities create tremendous competitive advantage—more devoted customers, stronger cultures, breakthrough ideas, more effective teams. They’re discovering also that while many of us regard these abilities as innate traits—“he’s a real people person,” “she’s naturally creative”—it turns out they can all be developed and are being developed in far-sighted organizations from software firms to the U.S. Army to the Cleveland Clinic.

"Geoffrey C. Ward, Ken Burns",Jazz: A History of America's Music,,English,,"The companion volume to the ten-part PBS TV series by the team responsible forThe Civil War and Baseball.Continuing in the tradition of their critically acclaimed works, Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns vividly bring to life the story of the quintessential American music—jazz. Born in the black community of turn-of-the-century New Orleans but played from the beginning by musicians of every color, jazz celebrates all Americans at their best.Here are the stories of the extraordinary men and women who made the music: Louis Armstrong, the fatherless waif whose unrivaled genius helped turn jazz into a soloist's art and influenced every singer, every instrumentalist who came after him; Duke Ellington, the pampered son of middle-class parents who turned a whole orchestra into his personal instrument, wrote nearly two thousand pieces for it, and captured more of American life than any other composer. Bix Beiderbecke, the doomed cornet prodigy who showed white musicians that they too could make an important contribution to the music; Benny Goodman, the immigrants' son who learned the clarinet to help feed his family, but who grew up to teach a whole country how to dance; Billie Holiday, whose distinctive style routinely transformed mediocre music into great art; Charlie Parker, who helped lead a musical revolution, only to destroy himself at thirty-four; and Miles Davis, whose search for fresh ways to sound made him the most influential jazz musician of his generation, and then led him to abandon jazz altogether. Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Tatum, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Artie Shaw, and Ella Fitzgerald are all here; so are Sidney Bechet, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and a host of others.But Jazz is more than mere biography. The history of the music echoes the history of twentieth-century America. Jazz provided the background for the giddy era that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Jazz Age. The irresistible pulse of big-band swing lifted the spirits and boosted American morale during the Great Depression and World War II. The virtuosic, demanding style called bebop mirrored the stepped-up pace and dislocation that came with peace. During the Cold War era, jazz served as a propaganda weapon—and forged links with the burgeoning counterculture. The story of jazz encompasses the story of American courtship and show business; the epic growth of great cities—New Orleans and Chicago, Kansas City and New York—and the struggle for civil rights and simple justice that continues into the new millennium.Visually stunning, with more than five hundred photographs, some never before published, this book, like the music it chronicles, is an exploration—and a celebration—of the American experiment.From the Hardcover edition.",,,11/07/00,October 8th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Music', 'History', 'Jazz', 'Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'American History', 'Pop Culture']",,9780679765394,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348341668l/178100.jpg,4.12,[],93.0,1.0,,178100.Jazz,,,,,96.0,505.0,512,,Knopf,"['200', '194', '91', '14', '6']",,,[],,
Geoffrey Chaucer,The Canterbury Tales,,,Poetry,"'Now as I've drunk a draught of corn-ripe ale, By God it stands to reason I can strike On some good story that you all will like' In The Canterbury Tales Chaucer created one of the great touchstones of English literature, a masterly collection of chivalric romances, moral allegories and low farce. A story-telling competition within a group of pilgrims from all walks of life is the occasion for a series of tales that range from the Knight's account of courtly love and the ebullient Wife of Bath's Arthurian legend, to the ribald anecdotes of the Miller and the Cook.

"Geoffrey Chaucer, Nevill Coghill (Translation)",Troilus and Criseyde,,English,,"Considered one of Chaucer’s finest poems, second only to The Canterbury Tales in richness and depth, Troilus and Cressida is a tragic love story set against the background of the siege of Troy by the Greeks. Written in the 1380s, it presents Troilus, son of Priam and younger brother of Hector as a Trojan warrior of renown who sees, and falls deeply in love with the beautiful Cressida. Cressida is the daughter of Calchas, a Trojan priest and seer who, having divined the eventual fall of Troy, has deserted to Agamemnon’s camp, leaving his daughter in the besieged city, With the help of Pander, friend to Troilus and uncle to Cressida, the young couple meet and merge – but with unhappy consequences. Chaucer’s long poem is cast in seven-line rhymed stanzas, and is eased out of Middle English to be presented here in a lively modern verse translation by George Philip Krapp, who has retained not only the structure, but its spirit. Emotions run high, the love is intense, the story unfolds with a dramatic urgency that draws the listener ever onwards; yet Chaucer is Chaucer, and there are times when a deft line, a light insinuation, suggests the smile, the benevolence and the immediacy of the author of The Canterbury Tales. Troilus and Cressida, though often overshadowed by the Tales and time (and even Shakespeare who took up the story) is a monument in its own right in the canon of English literature. Once read it will never be forgotten.",,,10/30/85,August 26th 2004,"['Criseyde', 'Troilus']",Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'School', 'Geoffrey Chaucer', 'College', 'British Literature']",,9780140442397,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387707225l/820905.jpg,3.77,[],98.0,1.0,,820905.Troilus_and_Criseyde,,,,,90.0,5986.0,368,,Penguin Classics,"['1693', '2000', '1676', '474', '143']",,,['Troy'],,
"Geoffrey Chaucer, Nevill Coghill (Translator)",The Canterbury Tales,,English,,"The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.",,This translation by Nevill Coghill first published in 1951,10/28/00,01/30/03,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'School', 'Medieval', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classic Literature', 'Read For School']",,9780140424386,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589l/2696.jpg,3.5,[],73812.0,984.0,,2696.The_Canterbury_Tales,,,,,84.0,188606.0,521,,Penguin Books/Penguin Classics,"['37516', '58287', '62106', '22655', '8042']",,,['England'],,

"Geoffrey Holiday Hall, Simona Modica (translator), Leonardo Sciascia (contributor)",La fine è nota,,Italian,,"«Più di trent'anni fa - racconta Leonardo Sciascia nella presentazione a questo volume - precisamente nell'autunno del 1952, alla stazione ferroviaria di Caltanissetta acquistai l'ultimo dei ""gialli"" settimanali Mondadori: La morte alla finestra di G. Holiday Hall. E non che nei ""gialli"" Mondadori ne fossero mancati fino a quel momento di buoni, ma fin dalle prime pagine La morte alla finestra mi parve di qualità diversa, di livello più alto. Ero allora fortemente affezionato agli scrittori americani, da Steinbeck a Caldwell a Faulkner a Cain: e mi parve che in quella pleiade si accendesse il lumicino del giovane Holiday Hall, intruppato tra i ""giallisti"" ma di miglior vocazione e di diverso avvenire. Più precisamente avevo l'impressione che quel giovane scrittore (giovane e nuovo lo diceva la presentazione editoriale) avesse fatto i suoi latinucci sugli altri maggiori, e su Faulkner specialmente. Mi avvenne di leggere il libro qualche anno dopo, l'impressione di allora mi si confermò al punto che volli saperne di più. Scorsi l'elenco di tutti i ""gialli"" settimanali che erano nel frattempo usciti: ma non ne trovai altri di G. Holiday Hall. Andai a trovare Alberto Tedeschi, che della collana era direttore, per chiedergli di quell'autore, di quel libro. Tedeschi molto gentilmente cercò di soddisfare la mia curiosità, ma senza alcun risultato. G. Holiday Hall era scomparso dal mondo della detective story, né si era ripresentato al mondo letterario americano. Non ne seppi più nulla. Riletto dopo trentasette anni ancora mi pare valga la pena cercare di saperne di più sul suo autore. Un piccolo mistero che sarebbe divertente risolvere». Alla piccola inchiesta di Sciascia, sull'autore di questo strano giallo à rebours, a ritroso (al quale è parso giusto nella presente edizione restituire un titolo vicino all'originale tratto dal Giulio Cesare shakespeariano: La fine è nota), si è in grado di aggiungere queste poche notizie: Geoffrey Holiday Hall scrisse nel 1954 un nuovo romanzo The Watcher at the Door, poi più nulla; il suo editore americano non conserva più traccia di lui negli archivi; comparso in Francia col titolo L'homme de nulle part e con una conclusione diversa dall'originale, questo romanzo vinse nel 1954 il Grand Prix de la Litérature Policière; nemmeno l'editore francese ne sa di più su Geoffrey Holiday Hall.",,La memoria #210,02/28/49,1990,[],Paperback,"['Noir', 'Fiction', 'Americana', 'The United States Of America', 'Thriller']",,9788838906145,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1250730237l/6725978.jpg,4.09,"['Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for Romans étrangers (tie) (1953)', 'Edgar Award Nominee for Best First Novel (1950)']",97.0,1.0,,6725978-la-fine-nota,,,,,99.0,182.0,260,,Sellerio,"['55', '92', '33', '1', '1']",,,[],,

For centuries it seemed an impossible dream that international institutions could ever tell nation-states how to treat their own citizens. But after a century in which 160 million lives have been wasted by war, genocide, and torture, the worldwide human rights movement is gaining popular and political strength. In a book that has been called ""an epic work"" by ""The Times"" (London), Geoffrey Robertson, one of the world's leading human rights lawyers, weaves together disparate strands of history, philosophy, international law, and politics to show how an identification of the crime against humanity, first defined at Nuremberg, has become the key that unlocks the closed door of state sovereignty, enabling the international community to bring tyrants and torturers to heel. This newly revised and expanded edition features additional chapters on Iraq and Guantanamo, and incorporates insights from the author's experience since 2002 as a UN appeals judge for the Special Court on war crimes in Sierra Leone.

Georg Wilhelm Fredrich Hegel,Hegel: Elements of the Philosophy of Right,,,History,"This book is a translation of a classic work of modern social and political thought. Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Hegel's last major published work, is an attempt to systematize ethical theory, natural right, the philosophy of law, political theory, and the sociology of the modern state into the framework of Hegel's philosophy of history. Hegel's work has been interpreted in radically different ways, influencing many political movements from far right to far left, and is widely perceived as central to the communitarian tradition in modern ethical, social, and political thought. This edition includes extensive editorial material informing the reader of the historical background of Hegel's text, and explaining his allusions to Roman law and other sources, making use of lecture materials which have only recently become available.

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,The Berlin Phenomenology,,,History,"Since the three volume edition ofHegel's Philosophy of Subjective Spirit (1978, 19792) has been so well received, I have been encouraged to select that part of it most suitable for teaching purposes, and to publish it here as a separate work. As a teaching text, the Berlin Phenomenology has several important advan­ tages. Unlike so many ofHegel's writings, must notably theJena Phenomeno­ logy of 1807, it is concise and to the point, and concemed with issues already familiar to most students of philosophy. Since it consists for the most part of a searching and radical analysis of Kant's epistemology, Fichte's ethics and Schelling's system-building, it provides tirst-rate insight into Hegel's assessment of his immedi~te predecessors. When considered in context, as part of the Encyclopaedia if the Philosophical Sciences, it enables us to distinguish dearly between the systematic, the logical and the psychological aspects of Hegelianism, and is therefore also relevant to some of the central issues in modem phenomenology. It is to be hoped that the introduction and notes prepared for the present edition will prove helpful to both teachers and students. Every effort has been ma de to produce a thoroughly reliable ba sic text and an accurate translation. The text published in 1978 was prepared at the Hegel Archive in Bochum from photocopies, and I am most grateful to the Central Interfaculty of the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, for having made it possible for me to check the printed version against the original manuscripts.",,,,1981.0,,,,9027712050,9789027712059,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vy7SkjvmfLMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,210.0,,,,0.0,,,,

Miller (Translator), John Niemeyer Findlay (Foreword)",Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit,,English,,"Perhaps one of the most revolutionary works of philosophy ever presented, The Phenomenology of Spirit is Hegel's 1807 work that is in numerous ways extraordinary. It begins with a Preface, created after the rest of the manuscript was completed, that explains the core of his method and what sets it apart from any preceding philosophy. The Introduction, written before the rest of the work, summarizes and completes Kant's ideas on skepticism by rendering it moot and encouraging idealism and self-realization. The body of the work is divided into six sections of varying length, entitled ""Consciousness,"" ""Self-Consciousness,"" ""Reason,"" ""Spirit,"" ""Religion,"" and ""Absolute Knowledge."" A myriad of topics are discussed, and explained in such a harmoniously complex way that the method has been termed Hegelian dialectic.

An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system. In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language.

"George Bernard Shaw, John A. Bertolini (Introduction)",Pygmalion and Three Other Plays,,English,,"Pygmalion and Three Other Plays, by George Bernard Shaw, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Hailed as “a Tolstoy with jokes” by one critic, George Bernard Shaw was the most significant British playwright since the seventeenth century. Pygmalion persists as his best-loved play, one made into both a classic film—which won Shaw an Academy Award for best screenplay—and the perennially popular musical My Fair Lady.Pygmalion follows the adventures of phonetics professor Henry Higgins as he attempts to transform cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a refined lady. The scene in which Eliza appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most of Shaw’s work, Pygmalion wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality, and an innate understanding of human relationships.This volume also includes Major Barbara, which attacks both capitalism and charitable organizations, The Doctor’s Dilemma, a keen-eyed examination of medical morals and malpractice, and Heartbreak House, which exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I.John A.

"George Bishop (Goodreads Author), Tavia Gilbert (Goodreads Author)",Letter to My Daughter: A Novel,,English,,"Dear Elizabeth, It's early morning and I'm sitting here wondering where you are, hoping you're all right. A fight, ended by a slap, sends Elizabeth out the door of her Baton Rouge home on the eve of her fifteenth birthday. Her mother, Laura, is left to fret and worry—and remember. Wracked with guilt as she awaits Liz's return, Laura begins a letter to her daughter, hoping to convey ""everything I've always meant to tell you but never have."" In her painfully candid confession, Laura shares memories of her own troubled adolescence in rural Louisiana, growing up in an intensely conservative household. She recounts her relationship with a boy she loved despite her parents' disapproval, the fateful events that led to her being sent away to a strict Catholic boarding school, the personal tragedy brought upon her by the Vietnam War, and, finally, the meaning of the enigmatic tattoo below her right hip. Absorbing and affirming, George Bishop's magnificent debut brilliantly captures a sense of time and place with a distinct and inviting voice.

George Crile,Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of our Times,,English,,"Charlie Wilson's War was a publishing sensation and a New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times bestseller. In the early 1980s, a Houston socialite turned the attention of maverick Texas congressman Charlie Wilson to the ragged band of Afghan ""freedom fighters"" who continued, despite overwhelming odds, to fight the Soviet invaders. Wilson, who sat on the all-powerful House Appropriations Committee, managed to procure hundreds of millions of dollars to support the mujahideen. The arms were secretly procured and distributed with the help of an out-of-favor CIA operative, Gust Avrokotos, whose working-class Greek-American background made him an anomaly among the Ivy League world of American spies. Avrakotos handpicked a staff of CIA outcasts to run his operation and, with their help, continually stretched the Agency's rules to the breaking point. Moving from the back rooms of the Capitol, to secret chambers at Langley, to arms-dealers' conventions, to the Khyber Pass, this book presents an astonishing chapter of our recent past, and the key to understanding what helped trigger the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and ultimately led to the emergence of a brand-new foe in the form of radical Islam.",,,January 1st 2003,April 22nd 2004,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'War', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Espionage', 'Military History']",,9780802141248,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440722168l/29358._SY475_.jpg,4.01,"['Audie Award for Nonfiction, Unabridged (2004)']",37.0,1.0,,29358.Charlie_Wilson_s_War,,,,,95.0,7710.0,560,,Grove Press,"['2513', '3269', '1515', '325', '88']",,,[],,
George Dangerfield,The Strange Death of Liberal England,,English,,"At the beginning of the twentieth century England's empire spanned the globe, its economy was strong, and its political system seemed immune to the ills that inflicted so many other countries. After a resounding electoral triumph in 1906, the Liberals formed the government of the most powerful nation on earth, yet within a few years the House of Lords lost its absolute veto over legislation, the Home Rule crisis brought Ireland to the brink of civil war and led to an army mutiny, the campaign for woman's suffrage created widespread civil disorder and discredited the legal and penal systems, and an unprecedented wave of strikes swept the land.This is a classic account, first published in 1935, of the dramatic upheaval and political change that overwhelmed England in the period 1910-1914. Few books of history retain their relevance and vitality after more than sixty years. The Strange Death of Liberal England is one of the most important books of the English past, a prime example that history can be abiding literature. As a portrait of England enmeshed in the turbulence of new movements, which often led to violence against the pieties of Liberal England—until it was overwhelmed by the greatest violence of all, World War I—this extraordinary book has continued to exert a powerful influence on the way historians have observed early twentieth-century England.",,,1935,March 1st 1997,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'European History', 'British Literature', 'Ireland', 'Edwardian', 'Philosophy', '20th Century', 'Military Fiction']",,9780804729307,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351223081l/1138543.jpg,4.1,[],46.0,1.0,,1138543.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England,,,,,94.0,366.0,364,,Stanford University Press,"['146', '137', '62', '15', '6']",,,[],,

George Dohrmann,"Play Their Hearts Out: A Coach, His Star Recruit, and the Youth Basketball Machine",,English,,"Eight years of unfettered access, a keen sense of a story’s deepest truths, and a genuine compassion for his subject allow Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist George Dohrmann to take readers inside the machine that produces America’s basketball stars.    Hoop dreams aren’t just for players. The fever that grips college basketball prospects hoping to strike big-time NBA gold afflicts coaches, parents, and sneaker executives as well. Every one of them has a stake in keeping America’s wildly dysfunctional, incredibly lucrative youth basketball machine up and running—no matter the consequences. In Play Their Hearts Out, George Dohrmann offers an up-close and unforgettable look inside the maw of that machine. He shares what he learned from his years spent embedded with a group of talented young recruits from Southern California as they traveled the country playing in elite Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) events. It’s a cutthroat world where boys as young as eight or nine are subjected to a dizzying torrent of scrutiny and exploitation. Coaches vie to have them on their teams. Sneaker companies ply them with free shoes and gear. “All-star camps” are glorified cattle auctions, providing make-or-break opportunities to secure the promise of an elusive college scholarship.    At the book’s heart are the personal stories of two compelling figures: Joe Keller, an ambitious AAU coach with a master plan to find and promote “the next LeBron”—thereby paving his own path to power and riches; and Demetrius Walker, a fatherless latchkey kid who falls under Keller’s sway and struggles to live up to the unrealistic expectations his supposed benefactor has set for him. As their fortunes take shape and the pressure mounts—Demetrius finds himself profiled in Sports Illustrated at age fourteen, while Keller cultivates his business empire—Dohrmann weaves in the stories of numerous other parents, coaches, and players. Some of them see their prospects evaporate as a result of poor decisions and worse luck. Others learn how to thrive in a corrupt system by playing the right angles. Written with incomparable detail and insight, Play Their Hearts Out is a thoroughly unique narrative that reveals the inner workings of an American game, exposing the gritty reality that lies beneath so many dreams of fame and glory.",,,October 5th 2009,October 5th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'Basketball', 'Biography', 'History', 'High School', 'American', 'Sociology']",,9780345508607,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320501257l/8124176.jpg,4.21,['PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing (2011)'],39.0,1.0,,8124176-play-their-hearts-out,,,,,94.0,4201.0,432,,Ballantine Books,"['2153', '1170', '606', '172', '100']",,,[],,
George Dyson,Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe,,English,,"“It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence,” twenty-four-year-old Alan Turing announced in 1936. In Turing’s Cathedral, George Dyson focuses on a small group of men and women, led by John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who built one of the first computers to realize Alan Turing’s vision of a Universal Machine. Their work would break the distinction between numbers that mean things and numbers that do things—and our universe would never be the same. Using five kilobytes of memory (the amount allocated to displaying the cursor on a computer desktop of today), they achieved unprecedented success in both weather prediction and nuclear weapons design, while tackling, in their spare time, problems ranging from the evolution of viruses to the evolution of stars. Dyson’s account, both historic and prophetic, sheds important new light on how the digital universe exploded in the aftermath of World War II. The proliferation of both codes and machines was paralleled by two historic developments: the decoding of self-replicating sequences in biology and the invention of the hydrogen bomb. It’s no coincidence that the most destructive and the most constructive of human inventions appeared at exactly the same time.  How did code take over the world? In retracing how Alan Turing’s one-dimensional model became John von Neumann’s two-dimensional implementation, Turing’s Cathedral offers a series of provocative suggestions as to where the digital universe, now fully three-dimensional, may be heading next.",,,01/01/12,March 6th 2012,[],ebook,"['History', 'Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Technology', 'Computer Science', 'Biography', 'Computers', 'Mathematics', 'Audiobook', 'Programming']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1322700777l/12625589.jpg,3.57,['Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)'],92.0,1.0,,12625589-turing-s-cathedral,,,,,83.0,4161.0,505,,Pantheon,"['1037', '1226', '1203', '481', '214']",,,[],,

George Eliot,Daniel Deronda,,,Fiction,"Daniel Deronda, by George Eliot, is part of theBarnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. George Eliot''s last, most ambitious novel, Daniel Deronda aroused scandal when it first appeared in 1876. What begins as a passionate love story takes a surprising turn into the hidden world of the early Zionist movement in Victorian England. The story opens memorably at a roulette table, where we first meet the young and idealistic Daniel Deronda and the enchanting Gwendolen Harleth--whom many critics consider to be George Eliot''s finest creation. Although the two are immediately drawn to one another, Gwendolen--outwardly alluring and vivacious, inwardly complex and unsettled--is forced by circumstance into an oppressive marriage with the harsh aristocratic Henleigh Grandcourt. Deeply unhappy, she turns for friendship to Daniel, only to discover his involvement with Mirah Lapidoth, a talented young Jewish woman. Torn between his devotion to Gwendolen and his passion for Mirah and the plight of her people, Daniel is forced to look at his own mysterious past and find out who he really is--and who he wants to become.

George Eliot,Silas Marner,,English,,"George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, Silas Marner is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics.Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis.Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published Scenes of Clerical Life, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including The Mill on the Floss, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda.If you enjoyed Silas Marner, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, also available in Penguin Classics.'I think Silas Marner holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

As she reaches adulthood, the clash between their expectations and her desires is painfully played out as she finds herself torn between her relationships with three very different men: her proud and stubborn brother, a close friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy, and a charismatic but dangerous suitor.

In this well-reasoned, accessible book, Middle East expert George Grant answers the troubling questions on many believers' minds. Who are the followers of Islam, and what do they believe? What could have motivated those who carried out the acts of terror on September 11? Why has there been tension between Islam and the West for centuries? What are the true meanings of terms such as Ji'had, Intifada, and Dhimma? And is there any hope for peace? The call upon believers now-as always-is to prepare and equip ourselves so that we may stand fast.

Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect ""her"" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E. Cummings to recognize Herriman's genius almost immediately. Each of Fantagraphics' Krazy Ignatz volumes is designed by Chris Ware, creator of the wildly successful ACME Novelty Library series.

George Lakoff,Philosophy In The Flesh,,,Philosophy,"What are human beings like? How is knowledge possible? What is truth? Where do moral values come from? Questions like these have stood at the center of Western philosophy for centuries. In addressing them, philosophers have made certain fundamental assumptions-that we can know our own minds by introspection, that most of our thinking about the world is literal, and that reason is disembodied and universal-that are now called into question by well-established results of cognitive science. It has been shown empirically that:Most thought is unconscious. We have no direct conscious access to the mechanisms of thought and language. Our ideas go by too quickly and at too deep a level for us to observe them in any simple way.Abstract concepts are mostly metaphorical. Much of the subject matter of philosopy, such as the nature of time, morality, causation, the mind, and the self, relies heavily on basic metaphors derived from bodily experience. What is literal in our reasoning about such concepts is minimal and conceptually impoverished. All the richness comes from metaphor. For instance, we have two mutually incompatible metaphors for time, both of which represent it as movement through space: in one it is a flow past us and in the other a spatial dimension we move along.Mind is embodied. Thought requires a body-not in the trivial sense that you need a physical brain to think with, but in the profound sense that the very structure of our thoughts comes from the nature of the body. Nearly all of our unconscious metaphors are based on common bodily experiences.Most of the central themes of the Western philosophical tradition are called into question by these findings. The Cartesian person, with a mind wholly separate from the body, does not exist. The Kantian person, capable of moral action according to the dictates of a universal reason, does not exist. The phenomenological person, capable of knowing his or her mind entirely through introspection alone, does not exist. The utilitarian person, the Chomskian person, the poststructuralist person, the computational person, and the person defined by analytic philosopy all do not exist.Then what does?Lakoff and Johnson show that a philosopy responsible to the science of mind offers radically new and detailed understandings of what a person is. After first describing the philosophical stance that must follow from taking cognitive science seriously, they re-examine the basic concepts of the mind, time, causation, morality, and the self: then they rethink a host of philosophical traditions, from the classical Greeks through Kantian morality through modern analytic philosopy. They reveal the metaphorical structure underlying each mode of thought and show how the metaphysics of each theory flows from its metaphors. Finally, they take on two major issues of twentieth-century philosopy: how we conceive rationality, and how we conceive language.",,,,1999.0,,,,0465056741,9780465056743,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=csAStAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.07,,,,,,,,,,,,640.0,,,,1100.0,,,,
"George Lakoff, Mark Johnson",Metaphors We Live By,,English,,"The now-classic Metaphors We Live By changed our understanding of metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are ""metaphors we live by"", metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them.In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.",,,10/30/80,2003,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Linguistics', 'Psychology', 'Language', 'Science', 'Writing', 'Theory', 'Academic', 'Anthropology']",,9780226468013,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388194058l/34459._SX318_.jpg,4.1,[],158.0,2.0,,34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By,,,,,95.0,4858.0,276,,University of Chicago Press,"['1917', '1799', '888', '198', '56']",,,[],,

T. B. Clore, Camp Douglas survivorThe Chicago doctors who inspected the prison in 1863 called Camp Douglas an “extermination camp.” It quickly became the largest Confederate burial ground outside of the South.What George Levy’s meticulous research, including newly discovered hospital records, has uncovered is not a pretty picture. The story of Camp Douglas is one of brutal guards, deliberate starvation of prisoners, neglect of the sick, sadistic torture, murder, corruption at all levels, and a beef scandal reaching into the White House.As a result of the overcrowding and substandard provisions, disease ran rampant and the mortality rate soared. By the thousands, prisoners needlessly died of pneumonia, smallpox, and other maladies. Most were buried in unmarked mass graves. The exact number of those who died is impossible to discern because of the Union's haphazard recordkeeping and general disregard for the deceased.Among the most shocking revelations are such forms of torture as hanging prisoners by their thumbs, hanging them by their heels and then whipping them, and forcing prisoners to sit with their exposed buttocks in the ice and snow.The Confederate Camp Andersonville never saw such gratuitous barbarity.",,,March 1995,January 31st 1999,[],Hardcover,"['Civil War', 'History', 'American History', '19th Century', 'American Civil War', 'War', 'Historical']",,9781565543317,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347953264l/856619.jpg,4.17,[],10.0,1.0,,856619.To_Die_in_Chicago,,,,,94.0,36.0,448,,Pelican,"['17', '10', '7', '2', '0']",,,[],,

George M.

It is a simple guide on how to cure laziness, set goals, improve discipline, control your habits, and end procrastinating. Procrastination is quite a menace primarily because it makes you squander time and disregard its importance. The dilemma is that procrastination is something that comes easily to many of us. And it is a problem that does interfere with our routine chores, performance, and productivity. Studies show that about 25% to 75% of college students are prone to procrastination when it comes to doing their academic work. Procrastination is a major reason why, often, PhD students fail to complete their university dissertations on time. While these statistics pertain to only academics, the truth is that procrastination does get in the way of our routine household chores, personal obligations, and even relationships. Many times, we find ourselves preferring to snuggle in bed over meeting a friend or binge-watching movies instead of doing errands. One way or another, procrastination does influence your life and that too, negatively. So how is it that you can get better control of it and learn to overcome this unhealthy habit? Well, that is the focus of this guide. This book gives you a better understanding of the problem at hand, ‘procrastination,’ and provides you with actionable and effective guidelines on how to control your bad habits, inculcate self-discipline, manage your temptations, set meaningful goals and achieve them with utmost focus and determination.Here Is A Preview Of What You Will Learn

At times almost forthrightly allegorical, at other times richly dreamlike (and indeed having a close connection to the symbolic world of dreams), this story of a young man who finds himself on a long journey through a land of fantasy is more truly the story of the spiritual quest that is at the core of his life's work, a quest that must end with the ultimate surrender of the self.The glory of MacDonald's work is that this surrender is both hard won (or lost!) and yet rippling with joy when at last experienced.

George Mackay Brown,The Golden Bird: Two Orkney Stories,,,,"These two long stories are set, like most of George Mackay Brown's work, in Orkney and in a period, the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the pattern of island life, little changed since Viking times, was beginning to be threatened. ""The Golden Bird"" tells the story of the slow decline of an island community: a scattered village dependant on the sea for its livelihood and at risk from it, a place subject to the peculiar tensions of isolation and the unsettling influence of new values. ""The Life and Death of John Voe"" looks at the life of a typical young Orkney man: after whaling and sailing and gold-mining he comes home to devote the rest of his days to a beautiful country girl. These stories are the creation of a very rich imagination, of a practised and skilful writer, but they also have the power and simplicity of the traditional ballad. They will delight Mackay Brown's fans.",,,01/01/94,2008,[],Paperback,[],,9781846970856,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1249771562l/6688697.jpg,3.86,['James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction (1987)'],100.0,1.0,,6688697-the-golden-bird,,,,,96.0,28.0,240,,Birlinn,"['6', '13', '8', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Its people are ushering in a new era of technology, dazzled each day by new inventions.

George Molho,Scarred: A Memoir,,English,,"In 1978, seven-year-old George Molho was kidnapped by his own father. For a year, he survived mental and physical abuse to the point of torture. He found it easier to get used tohell, instead of hoping that heaven was around the corner. George eventually escaped, but surviving the aftermath proved to be much more difficult.Past and present are skillfully woven together to connect the pieces of Molho's childhood and adult life that shaped the man he would become. The old adage 'love conquers all' is splayed open to reveal the inner workings thatwe all seek to understand. George was lucky to learn how to love from his family before his abduction, before his father's cruel version of love was inflicted upon his young body and psyche. Later in life, love compels him to reveal all that happened on the mountainside wherehe left his innocence as a boy.It's not about how hard we get hit; it's about how much we can take and keep moving forward.

Making use of remarkable scientific discoveries that transform our understanding of how natural systems work, George Monbiot explores a new, positive environmentalism that shows how damaged ecosystems on land and at sea can be restored, and how this restoration can revitalize and enrich our lives. Challenging what he calls his “ecological boredom,” Monbiot weaves together a beautiful and riveting tale of wild places, wildlife, and wild people. Roaming the hills of Britain and the forests of Europe, kayaking off the coast of Wales with dolphins and seabirds, he seeks out the places that still possess something of the untamed spirit he would like to resurrect.He meets people trying to restore lost forests and bring back missing species—such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, wild boar, and gray whales—and explores astonishing evidence that certain species, not just humans, have the power to shape the physical landscape.

George Orwell,Keep the Aspidistra Flying,,English,,"London, 1936. Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and ""rather moth-eaten already,"" a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen ""flatter than any pancake,"" Gordon has given up a ""good"" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes), ""If you have no money ... women won't love you."" On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of ""mingy, lower-middle-class decency"" he is fleeing in his downward flight.In Keep the Aspidistra Flying, George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls ""the money-world"" in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge, too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself. Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a ""happy"" ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour, but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer.",,,04/20/36,October 26th 2000,"['Gordon Comstock', 'Rosemary Waterlow', 'Philip Ravelston', 'Julia Comstock', 'Hermione Slater', 'Mrs Wisbeach', 'Mr Erskine']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Novels', 'English Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Modern Classics', 'Politics']",,9780141183725,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331244097l/9648.jpg,3.89,[],555.0,7.0,,9648.Keep_the_Aspidistra_Flying,,,,,94.0,15837.0,277,,Penguin Books Ltd,"['4393', '6484', '3970', '824', '166']",,,"['London, England']",,

George Orwell,La fattoria degli animali,,,,"
  La fattoria degli animali
 è una novella allegorica di George Orwell pubblicata per la prima volta il 17 agosto1945. Secondo Orwell, il libro riflette sugli eventi che portarono alla Rivoluzione russa e successivamente all'era staliniana dell'Unione sovietica. L'autore, un socialista democratico, fu critico nei confronti di Stalin e ostile allo stalinismo, atteggiamento che fu criticamente modellato sulla base delle sue esperienze durante la Guerra civile spagnola. Orwell sapeva che l'Unione sovietica era divenuta una dittatura brutale, edificata sul culto della personalità e retta da un regno del terrore. In una lettera a Yvonne Davet, l'autore descrisse La fattoria degli animali come una narrazione satirica contro Stalin («un conte satirique contre Staline»); inoltre, nel suo saggio Perché scrivo (1946), scrisse che La fattoria degli animali fu il primo libro in cui lui tentò, con piena consapevolezza di quanto stava facendo, «di fondere scopo politico e scopo artistico in un tutt'uno».Il titolo originale dell'opera era Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, tuttavia gli editori statunitensi abbandonarono il sottotitolo quando venne pubblicata nel 1946 e solo una delle traduzioni lo mantenne durante la vita dell'autore. Altri sottotitoli riportano A Satire e A Contemporary Satire. Orwell suggerì, per la traduzione francese, il titolo Union des républiques socialistes animales, abbreviato in URSA, parola latina per «orso», un simbolo della Russia. Il titolo fa riferimento anche al nome dell'Unione sovietica in francese: Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques.",,,,February 6th 2020,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B084KJYVJ2,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581096392l/51053366._SX318_.jpg,4.39,[],95.0,1.0,,51053366-la-fattoria-degli-animali,,,,,98.0,311.0,,,Real ePublisher & Giancarlo Rossini,"['167', '106', '31', '5', '2']",,,[],,

George Padmore,Pan-Africanism or Communism,,,,"George Padmore's Pan-Africanism or Communism shares the distinction common to most great works of historical writing of being the creation of a participant-as-historian. For, next to the colossal figure of W.E.B. Du Bois, Padmore, the political revolutionary, holds an exalted position in the pantheon of Pan-Africanism, and in this, his chef d'oeuvre, he has presented us with a most vivid account of that movement in which he played so exemplary a role. Indeed, there was in Padmore an admirable double-faceted vis historica - the revolutionary's desire to make history and the writer's impulse to describe it and grasp its meaning.The name George Padmore is a nom de guerre that he adopted when he joined the Communist Party. His real name was Malcolm Nurse. He rose to become the foremost black figure in the Communist International - the Comintern - and he was commissioned into the Red Army as a colonel. He travelled extensively in Africa in an effort to create the nucleus of a Comintern-directed African leadership. In this book he gives a graphic exposition of the history of African, West Indian and American Negro mass movements from 1787 to 1957, and their flirtations with International Communism. He helped to shape much of the latter phases of that affair. Soviet policy finally induced Padmore's resignation from the Comintern and also from the Communist Party. As Aimé Césaire stated when he too broke with the Communists twenty-five years later: 'It's neither Marxism nor Communism I repudiate; the use certain people have made of Marxism and Communism is what I condemn. What I want is that Marxism and Communism be harnessed into the service of coloured peoples, and not coloured people into the service of Marxism and Communism. That the doctrine and the movement be tailored to fit men, not men to fit the movement. And - of course - that goes for others besides Communists.'But in severing connections with them, Padmore did not join the frenzied ranks of the professional anti-Communists in remorseful contrition and fulminations over the god that failed them. Nor did he reconcile himself to imperialism and the oppressions of African peoples. There was in him a need to intensify the struggle against imperialism as also against that Communism which has been polluted by the exigencies of Stalin's balance-of-power political struggles with the Western countries. Arthur Koestler once wrote that 'if we survey history and compare the lofty aims in the name of which revolutions were started, and the sorry end to which they came, we see again and again how a polluted civilization pollutes its own revolutionary offspring'. Such an observation would lead - as, curiously, it did not lead Koestler - to the conclusion that if indeed the 'revolutionary offspring', Communism, has been 'polluted' by the civilization against which it has revolted, the struggle against this pollution becomes at once and simultaneously the struggle against the polluted offspring as also and inevitably against the source of that pollution. Padmore drew this conclusion. For though conceived by him as a bulwark against Communism, yet 'Pan-Africanism recognizes much that is true in the Marxist interpretation of history, since it provides a rational explanation for a good deal that would otherwise be unintelligible.'– Azinna NwaforThis book recounts the great saga of the rise of black people from slavery to freedom on an intercontinental scale and brings us to the crucial crossroads - a hopeful resolution for black freedom and a partnership of races purged of terror, lynching and colour lines, etc., or a continental mass struggle conducted by Africans in Africa, a struggle that will duplicate the tragic upheavals in Asia. It is not [solely] up to black men to say how this issue will be resolved; but make no mistake: the black man will cling tenaciously to his dream of freedom!If my words carry any weight, I commend this volume for close study to the white governmental officials of the Western world, to white churchmen, Catholic and Protestant alike, and equally to the dour and brooding white rulers in the Kremlin. I would urge them to read it and get a true, human perspective of the hopes, fears, struggles and hard-bought progress of the Negro in the modern world.I, for one, salute and congratulate George Padmore for his having kept the faith and fought the good fight.– Richard Wright",,,January 1st 1971,,[],,"['Africa', 'History']",,9780385073226,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181025906l/1105253.jpg,4.21,[],32.0,1.0,,1105253.Pan_Africanism_or_Communism,,,,,89.0,19.0,,,,"['9', '7', '1', '2', '0']",,,[],,

George Pendle,Death: A Life,,English,,"The shocking new memoir from DeathAt last, the mysterious, feared, and misunderstood being known only as “Death” talks frankly and unforgettably about his infinitely awful existence. Chronicling his abusive childhood, his near-fatal addiction to Life, his excruciating time in rehab, and the ultimate triumph of his true nature, this long-awaited autobiography finally reveals the inner story of one of the most troubling, and troubled, figures in history. For the first time, Death reveals his affairs with the living, his maltreatment at the hands of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the ungodly truth behind the infamous “Jesus Incident,” and the loneliness of being the End of All Things. Intense, unpredictable, and instantly engaging, Death: A Life is not only a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a universe that, despite its profound flaws, gave Death the fiery determination to carve out a successful existence on his own terms. DEATH was born in Hell, the only son of Satan and Sin. He was educated in the Palace of Pandemonium and the Garden of Eden. Since before the Dawn of Time, he has ushered souls into the darkness of eternity.

George R.R. Martin,Fevre Dream,,English,,"When struggling riverboat captain Abner Marsh receives an offer of partnership from a wealthy aristocrat, he suspects something’s amiss. But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesn’t care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh’s dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he won’t earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of Marsh’s concern—no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. Marsh meant to turn down York’s offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolve—coupled with the terrible force of York’s mesmerizing gaze. Not until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare...and mankind’s most impossible dream. Here is the spellbinding tale of a vampire’s quest to unite his race with humanity, of a garrulous riverman’s dream of immortality, and of the undying legends of the steamboat era and a majestic, ancient river.",,,09/01/82,September 28th 2004,"['Abner Marsh', 'Joshua York', 'Damon Julian']",Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Vampires', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Historical Fantasy']",,9780553383058,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388197708l/382450.jpg,3.87,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (1983)', 'World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Novel (1983)']",560.0,7.0,,382450.Fevre_Dream,,,,,93.0,22129.0,334,,Bantam,"['5764', '9449', '5431', '1172', '313']",,,"['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)']",,

An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R.

Now here is the entire monumental cycle: A GAME OF THRONESA CLASH OF KINGSA STORM OF SWORDSA FEAST OF CROWSA DANCE WITH DRAGONS Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.  Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.""",A Song of Ice and Fire #1-5,Re-Packaged Edition,10/28/00,July 22nd 2011,"['Tyrion Lannister', 'Arya Stark', 'Khal Drogo', 'Aerys Targaryen II', 'Aegon Targaryen', 'Jon Snow', 'Jaime Lannister', 'Cersei Lannister', 'Petyr Baelish', 'Sansa Stark', 'Varys', 'Brienne of Tarth', 'Samwell Tarly', 'Arianne Martell', 'Victarion Greyjoy', 'Asha Greyjoy', 'Pyp', 'Tommen Baratheon', 'Brandon Stark', 'Catelyn Stark', 'Daenerys Targaryen', 'Robb Stark', 'Joffrey Baratheon', 'Tywin Lannister', 'Stannis Baratheon', 'Melisandre', 'Davos Seaworth', 'Lysa Arryn', 'Hodor', 'Sandor Clegane', 'Jorah Mormont', 'Grenn', 'Oswell Kettleback', 'Theon Greyjoy', 'Euron Greyjoy', 'Margaery Tyrell', 'Robert Baratheon', 'Ser Gregor Clegane', 'Qyburn', 'Lord Bronn', 'Walder Frey', 'Eddard Stark', 'Yara Greyjoy', 'Jory Cassel', 'Viserys Targaryen', 'Olenna Tyrell']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Dragons', 'Science Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Adult']",,9781780484259,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339340118l/12177850.jpg,4.56,[],2616.0,35.0,,12177850-a-song-of-ice-and-fire,,,,,97.0,53233.0,5216,,Zatpix,"['36854', '11677', '3118', '890', '694']",,,[],,

George R.R. Martin,A Game of Thrones / A Clash of Kings,,English,,"2 eBooks in 1! George R. R. Martin, a writer of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination, has created a landmark of fantasy fiction. Now his two epic works, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings are combined together in this eBook edition. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards who come together in a time of grim omens. Here, an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal, a tribe of fierce wildings carry men off into madness, a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne, a child is lost in the twilight between life and death, and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. In the eagerly awaited second volume in this epic saga, he once again proves himself a master myth-maker, setting a standard against which all other fantasy novels will be measured for years to come. Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leaders--Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon--who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky--a comet the color of blood and flame--six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel ... and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantment--a tale of pure excitement you will never forget.",A Song of Ice and Fire #1-2,,10/29/96,December 23rd 2010,[],Kindle Edition,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'High Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction']",,B000FBFMMU,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336020650l/5061675.jpg,4.53,[],240.0,3.0,,5061675-a-game-of-thrones-a-clash-of-kings,,,,,99.0,25119.0,864,,Voyager,"['15965', '7087', '1712', '241', '114']",,,[],,

    In 1946, an alien virus that rewrites human DNA was accidentally unleashed in the skies over New York City. It killed ninety percent of those it infected. Nine percent survived, mutated into tragically deformed creatures. And one percent gained superpowers. The Wild Cards shared-universe series, created and edited by New York Times #1 bestseller George R. R. Martin (called “the American Tolkien” by Time), is the tale of the history of the world since then—and of the heroes among the one percent. 
    Now, in the latest Wild Cards mosaic novel, we get to know the hardbitten world of Manhattan’s Fifth Precinct—or “Fort Freak,” as cops and malefactors alike call the cop-shop where every other desk sergeant, detective, and patrol officer is more than human. 
     
    Featuring original work by writers such as Cherie Priest, author of the bestselling Boneshaker; Paul Cornell, Hugo–nominated comic book and Doctor Who writer; David Anthony Durham, winner of 2009’s John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer; and many others, Fort Freak is one of the strongest offerings yet in the ongoing Wild Cards project.

For Adara was a winter child, born during the worst freeze that anyone, even the Old Ones, could remember. Adara could not remember the first time she had seen the ice dragon. It seemed that it had always been in her life, glimpsed from afar as she played in the frigid snow long after the other children had fled the cold. In her fourth year she touched it, and in her fifth year she rode upon its broad, chilled back for the first time. Then, in her seventh year, on a calm summer day, fiery dragons from the North swooped down upon the peaceful farm that was Adara's home. And only a winter child--and the ice dragon who loved her--could save her world from utter destruction. ""The Ice Dragon"" marks the highly anticipated children's book debut of George R.R.

Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart. What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.

"George R.R.

But the life he found on the far-off planet of Sao Paulo was no better than the one he had abandoned.Tough, volatile, and angry--a luckless prospector hoping for that one rich strike that will make him wealthy--Ramon is content only when on his own out in the bush, far from the dirty, loud, bustling hive of humanity that he detests with sociopathic fervor. Then one night his rage and too much alcohol get the better of him, resulting in sudden bloodshed and a high-profile murder. Ramon is forced to flee into the wilderness for however long it will take for the furor to die down.Here, mercifully, almost happily alone, Ramon is once again free. But while searching for his long-elusive lode, he stumbles upon something completely unexpected: a highly advanced alien race in hiding; fugitives like himself on a world not their own. Suddenly in possession of a powerful, dangerous secret, Ramon must battle for his freedom from alien captors and also against the hostile and unpredictable planet. And so the chase begins.Police, fugitive aliens, and a human murderer weave a web of shifting alliances as Ramon enters the greatest manhunt the alien world of Sao Paulo has ever known. If he is to survive, Ramon must overcome inscrutable aliens and deadly predators, but his greatest enemy is himself. With every move in the desperate game, he struggles to outwit his enemies and solve the mystery of a murder he himself committed.A rip-roaring adventure tale and character study of a fascinating and twisted mind, ""Hunter's Run"" showcases three masters of the form at their best.",,,09/30/07,January 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space', 'Aliens', 'Thriller', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'American']",,9780061373299,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442256450l/1282266._SY475_.jpg,3.63,['Seiun Award 星雲賞 Nominee for Best Translated Long Form (2011)'],97.0,1.0,,1282266.Hunter_s_Run,,,,,91.0,2892.0,320,,Harper Voyager,"['495', '1150', '988', '208', '51']",,,[],,

The story of Consuelo, a Gypsy singer, and her adventures in Venice, Austria and Bohemia, narrated by the most eminent of French female writers. Sand was a prolific (nearly 60 novels) writer who shocked Paris with her own sexual escapades, but in her writing dealt with the serious issues of her time and was identified with the Romantic literary movement. Sand's strong, independent women characters would win her both the adoration of many other writers (mostly women) and the wrath of many reviewers (mostly men). She and her characters are enthusiastic, outspoken, sententious, with a bold manifesto of women's independence and a legitimate claim to emotional and sexual fulfillment. She was unique in her approach as a woman who refused to trivialize her craft because of her gender. Sand became known more for her eccentric lifestyle and love affairs with famous contemporaries, such as Alfred de Musset and Frederic Chopin, than her career as a writer.","Consuelo, et, La Comtesse de Rudolstadt #1",,10/30/41,November 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'France', 'Historical Fiction', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Music']",,9781410107558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348704744l/104262.jpg,4.09,[],163.0,2.0,,104262.Consuelo,,,,,92.0,1354.0,808,,Fredonia Books (NL),"['592', '424', '226', '87', '25']",,,[],,

George Saunders,Tenth of December,,English,,"One of the most important and blazingly original writers of his generation, George Saunders is an undisputed master of the short story, and Tenth of December is his most honest, accessible, and moving collection yet.In the taut opening, ""Victory Lap,"" a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of Tenth of December are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience. These stories take on the big questions and explore the fault lines of our own morality, delving into the questions of what makes us good and what makes us human.Unsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in Tenth of December—through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spirit—not only entertain and delight; they fulfill Chekhov's dictum that art should ""prepare us for tenderness.""",,,01/03/13,January 8th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Audiobook', 'American', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Short Story Collection']",,9780812993806,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349967540l/13641208.jpg,3.96,"['The Story Prize (2013)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)', 'Rathbones Folio Prize (2014)']",661.0,8.0,,13641208-tenth-of-december,,,,,90.0,61783.0,251,,Random House,"['22591', '22259', '10840', '4092', '2001']",,,[],,
George Saunders,Lincoln in the Bardo,,English,,"In his long-awaited first novel, American master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices—living and dead, historical and invented—to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?",,First Edition,02/28/17,February 14th 2017,['Abraham Lincoln'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780812995343,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492130850l/29906980.jpg,3.75,"['Booker Prize (2017)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for International Book (2018)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2017)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2017)', 'Gordon Burn Prize Nominee for Longlist (2017)', 'Golden Man Booker Prize Nominee (2018)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2019)']",648.0,7.0,,29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo,,,,,84.0,122955.0,343,,Random House,"['39546', '39112', '25106', '11986', '7205']",,,"['Washington, D.C.

"George Saunders, Lane Smith (Illustrator)",The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip,,English,,"From the bestselling author of Tenth of December comes a splendid new edition of his acclaimed collaboration with the illustrator behind The Stinky Cheese Man and James and the Giant Peach! Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious images, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a modern fable for people of all ages that touches on the power of kindness, generosity, compassion, and community. In the seaside village of Frip live three families: the Romos, the Ronsens, and a little girl named Capable and her father. The economy of Frip is based solely on goat’s milk, and this is a problem because the village is plagued by gappers: bright orange, many-eyed creatures the size of softballs that love to attach themselves to goats. When a gapper gets near a goat, it lets out a high-pitched shriek of joy that puts the goats off giving milk, which means that every few hours the children of Frip have to go outside, brush the gappers off their goats, and toss them into the sea. The gappers have always been everyone’s problem, until one day they get a little smarter, and instead of spreading out, they gang up: on Capable’s goats. Free at last of the tyranny of the gappers, will her neighbors rally to help her? Or will they turn their backs, forcing Capable to bear the misfortune alone? Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious illustrations by Lane Smith and a brilliant story by George Saunders that explores universal themes of community and kindness, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a rich and resonant story for those that have all and those that have not.Praise for The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip“In a perfect world, every child would own a copy of this profound, funny fable. . . . Every adult would own a copy too, and would marvel at how this smart, subversive little book is even deeper and more hilarious than any child could know.”—Entertainment Weekly “Saunders’s idiosyncratic voice makes an almost perfect accompaniment to children’s book illustrator Smith’s heightened characterizations and slightly surreal backdrops.”—Publishers Weekly “A riveting, funny, and sly new fairy tale.”—Miami Herald",,,11/24/00,March 29th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Picture Books', 'Short Stories', 'Young Adult', 'American', 'Animals', 'Graphic Novels']",,9781932416374,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386921973l/28748.jpg,4.11,"['Zilveren Griffel (2003)', 'Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Nominee for Kinderbuch (2005)']",97.0,1.0,,28748.The_Very_Persistent_Gappers_of_Frip,,,,,96.0,3362.0,84,,McSweeney's,"['1289', '1325', '608', '117', '23']",,,[],,

George Sayer,Jack: A Life of C. S.

I think he will be a most interesting tutor to have.""""Interesting? Yes, he's certainly that,"" said the man, who I later learned was J. R. R. Tolkien. ""You'll never get to the bottom of him.""Over the next twenty-nine years, author George Sayer's first impression about C. S. Lewis proved true. He was interesting; but he was more than just that. He was a devout Christian, gifted literary scholar, best-selling author, and brilliant apologist. Sayer draws from a variety of sources, including his close friendship with Lewis and the million-word diary of Lewis's brother, to paint a portrait of the man whose friends knew him as Jack.Offering glimpses into Lewis's extraordinary relationships and experiences, Jack details the great scholar's life at the Kilns; days at Magdalen College; meetings with the Inklings; marriage to Joy Davidman Gresham; and the creative process that produced such world-famous works as the classic Chronicles of Narnia, Mere Christianity, and The Screwtape Letters.This book is an intimate account of the man who helped--and through his works, continues to help--generations hear and understand the heart of Christianity.",,,06/01/88,June 20th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Spirituality']",,9781581347395,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369822011l/30617.jpg,4.09,['Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inklings Studies (1991)'],75.0,1.0,,30617.Jack,,,,,94.0,2559.0,457,,Crossway Books,"['1027', '925', '463', '92', '52']",,,[],,

"George Selden, Garth Williams (Illustrator)",The Cricket in Times Square,,English,,"One night, the sounds of New York City--the rumbling of subway trains, thrumming of automobile tires, hooting of horns, howling of brakes, and the babbling of voices--is interrupted by a sound that even Tucker Mouse, a jaded inhabitant of Times Square, has never heard before. Mario, the son of Mama and Papa Bellini, proprietors of the subway-station newsstand, had only heard the sound once. What was this new, strangely musical chirping? None other than the mellifluous leg-rubbing of the somewhat disoriented Chester Cricket from Connecticut. Attracted by the irresistible smell of liverwurst, Chester had foolishly jumped into the picnic basket of some unsuspecting New Yorkers on a junket to the country. Despite the insect's wurst intentions, he ends up in a pile of dirt in Times Square. Mario is elated to find Chester. He begs his parents to let him keep the shiny insect in the newsstand, assuring his bug-fearing mother that crickets are harmless, maybe even good luck. What ensues is an altogether captivating spin on the city mouse/country mouse story, as Chester adjusts to the bustle of the big city. Despite the cricket's comfortable matchbox bed (with Kleenex sheets); the fancy, seven-tiered pagoda cricket cage from Sai Fong's novelty shop; tasty mulberry leaves; the jolly company of Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat; and even his new-found fame as ""the most famous musician in New York City,"" Chester begins to miss his peaceful life in the Connecticut countryside. The Cricket in Times Square--a Newbery Honor Book in 1961--is charmingly illustrated by the well-loved Garth Williams, and the tiniest details of this elegantly spun, vividly told, surprisingly suspenseful tale will stick with children for years and years. Make sure this classic sits on the shelf of your favorite child, right next to The Wind in the Willows.

George Sessions (Editor),Deep Ecology for the Twenty-First Century,,English,,"Every day, in newspapers and on television, we read and hear about the ongoing destruction of the environment: the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, deforestation, and air and water pollution. Deep Ecology offers a solution to the environmental crisis through a radical shift in human consciousness--a fundamental change in the way people relate with the environment. Instead of thinking of nature as a resource to be used for human needs, Deep Ecology argues that the true value of nature is intrinsic and independent of its utility. Emerging in the 1980s as an influential philosophical, social, and political movement, Deep Ecology has shaped the environmental debate among leading activists and policymakers--from former Vice-President Al Gore to Dave Forman, cofounder of Earth First!Deep Ecology for the Twenty-First Century  contains thirty-nine articles by the leading writers and thinkers in the filed, offering a comprehensive array of perspectives on this new approach to environmentalism, exploring:- The basic philosophy of Deep Ecology.  - Its roots in the writings of Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and Rachel Carson.  - The relationship of Deep Ecology to social ecology, ecofeminism, the Greens, and New Age futurism.  - How Deep Ecology as a way of life is exemplified by two important environmentalists: poet Gary Snyder and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess.  - The philosophical dimensions of this environmental movement by its leading theorist.  - The politics of ecological sustainability and the social and political implications of Deep Ecology for the next century.",,,11/05/94,January 24th 1995,[],Paperback,"['Ecology', 'Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Sustainability', 'Nature']",,9781570620492,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390240467l/247819.jpg,3.9,[],95.0,1.0,,247819.Deep_Ecology_for_the_Twenty_First_Century,,,,,91.0,92.0,520,,Shambhala,"['29', '34', '21', '7', '1']",,,[],,

George Stalk;Robert Lachenauer;John Butman,Hardball,Are You Playing to Play Or Playing to Win?,,Business & Economics,"Hardball takes leaders deep inside the world of hardball competition - a world where the players are zealously committed to winning and relentlessly driven to strengthen their competitive positions, creating a virtuous cycle that puts them far out of competitors' reach. Based on twenty-five years of experience advising and observing a range of companies, Stalk and Lachenauer reveal how hardball competitors achieve decisive victories - without bending the law and without compromising their obligations to customers and stakeholders. These companies often play rough, and they don't apologize for it. Yet they are also extraordinarily adept at the ""soft"" side of management - rallying talent and building culture through a laserlike focus on the few issues most critical to success. Using detailed and engaging stories from many industries, Hardball outlines seven classic hardball strategies: unleash massive and overwhelming force, exploit anomalies, threaten competitors' profit sanctuaries, take it and make it your own, entice competitors' into retreat, break industry compromises, and hardball M&A. The authors reveal who uses hardball strategies, under what circumstances each strategy is most effective, and how to orchestrate the attack.",,,,2004.0,,,,1591391679,9781591391678,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cscGBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.49,,,,,,,,,,,,192.0,,,,82.0,,,,
George Steger (Goodreads Author),Sebastian's Way: The Paladin,,,,"HE'S FOUGHT FOR HIS LANDS, HIS MARRIAGE, AND HIS KING. THE FIGHT FOR HIS SOUL IS JUST BEGINNING.""He's alive."" With these two words, the world as Sebastian knows it will never be the same. The news that his cousin Konrad-his sworn enemy and abusive first husband of his beloved wife Adela-means that his marriage is no longer valid. Even the high king Charlemagne cannot challenge the decision of a powerful emerging Church. Sebastian can do nothing but watch as the love of his life enters a convent.This epic tale of love and honor sweeps the reader back into the fascinating 9th century world of the incomparable Charlemagne. No mere military account of conquests and battles, this is a rich, well-rounded period drama and an authentic recreation of the early medieval world. Book I of this three-volume series was highly recommended by the Historical Novel Society. The second novel does not disappoint, as the hero is sent from the king's Rhineland court to three preeminent capitals of the 9th-century medieval world: Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Baghdad. Through his courage under pressure, original ideas, and steadfast service to the king Sebastian has become one of Charlemagne's twelve paladins, a high honor, but the cost is also high. He loses his beloved wife and family, becomes entangled with other beautiful women, and is submerged into a foreign world of intrigue and betrayal. Becoming a paladin changes Sebastian from a young man of faith and character into a hard-bitten warrior in a ruthless world. Thus the latter part of the novel presents a swirling adventure but also a parable of the ruin and redemption of a professional soldier.",,,,December 15th 2016,[],Paperback,[],,9781532012235,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482386222l/33506827.jpg,5.0,[],98.0,1.0,,33506827-sebastian-s-way,,,,,100.0,5.0,380,,iUniverse,"['5', '0', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Crackling dialogue, mordant humor, and unremitting tension drive the suspenseful stakes of the game higher in Boston's precarious underworld of small-time mobsters, crooked lawyers, and political gofers as George V. Higgins, the writer who boiled crime fiction harder, tracks Jackie Cogan's career in a gangland version of law and order. For Cogan is an enforcer; and when the Mob's rules get broken, he gets hired to ply his trade—murder. In the gritty, tough-talking pages of Higgins's 1974 national best-seller, Cogan is called in when a high-stake card game under the protection of the Mob is heisted. Expertly, with a ruthless businessman's efficiency, a shrewd sense of other people's weaknesses, and a style as cold as his stare, Cogan moves with reliable precision to restore the status quo as ill-conceived capers and double-dealing shenanigans erupt into high-voltage violence.

Giunge fin quasi al punto di abiurare, ma proprio sull'orlo della perdizione la coscienza della morte vicina lo salva. « Un corpo a corpo fra il soprannaturale e il mondo; ma il mondo non è mai stato sentito da Bernanos con una comprensione più potente e più tenera », cosi scrisse André Rousseaux del Diario di un curato di campagna, un romanzo che ha in sé fin dalle prime pagine una carica drammatica che si va facendo via via sempre più febbrile e compressa ed esplode poi, ad un tratto, in tutta la sua pienezza dinnanzi all'illuminazione.",,,11/05/36,January 1st 1988,['Priest of Ambricourt'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Religion', 'France', 'Catholic', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Spirituality', 'Christianity', 'French Literature']",,9788804315636,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353783446l/16168524.jpg,3.97,"[""Grand Prix du Roman de l'Académie française (1936)""]",74.0,1.0,,16168524-diario-di-un-curato-di-campagna,,,,,90.0,2120.0,244,,Mondadori,"['818', '687', '410', '147', '58']",,,['France'],,

Georges Perec,"W, Or, The Memory of Childhood",,,Fiction,"Guaranteed to send shock waves through the literary community, Perec's W tells two parallel stories. The first is autobiographical, describing the author's wartime boyhood. The second tale, denser, more disturbing, more horrifying, is the allegorical story of W, a mythical island off Tierra del Fuego, governed by the thrall of the Olympic ""ideal,"" where losers are tortured and winners held in temporary idolatry. As the reader soon discovers, W is a place where ""it is more important to be lucky than to be deserving,"" and ""you have to fight to live ... ÃwithÂ¨ no recourse, no mercy, no salvation, not even any hope that time will sort things out."" Here, sport is glorified and victors honored, but athletes are vilified, losers executed, stealing encouraged, rape common, and violence a fact of life. Perec's interpretive vision of the Holocaust forces us to ask the question central to our time: How did this happen before our eyes? How did we look at those ""shells of skin and bone, ashen faced, with their backs permanently bent, their eyes full of panic and their suppurating sores?"" How did all of this happen, not on W, but before millions of spectators, some horrified, some cheering, some in-different, but all present at the games watching the events of that grisly arena?",,,,2003.0,,,,1567921582,9781567921588,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vuN10GmOHD0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.88,,,,,,,,,,,,176.0,,,,1395.0,,,,

"Georges Perec, David Bellos (Translator)",Life: A User's Manual,,English,,"Life: A User's Manual is an unclassified masterpiece, a sprawling compendium as encyclopedic as Dante's Commedia and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and, in its break with tradition, as inspiring as Joyce's Ulysses. Perec's spellbinding puzzle begins in an apartment block in the XVIIth arrondissement of Paris where, chapter by chapter, room by room, like an onion being peeled, an extraordinary rich cast of characters is revealed in a series of tales that are bizarre, unlikely, moving, funny, or (sometimes) quite ordinary. From the confessions of a racing cyclist to the plans of an avenging murderer, from a young ethnographer obsessed with a Sumatran tribe to the death of a trapeze artist, from the fears of an ex-croupier to the dreams of a sex-change pop star to an eccentric English millionaire who has devised the ultimate pastime, Life is a manual of human irony, portraying the mixed marriages of fortunes, passions and despairs, betrayals and bereavements, of hundreds of lives in Paris and around the world.But the novel in more than an extraordinary range of fictions; it is a closely observed account of life and experience. The apartment block's one hundred rooms are arranged in a magic square, and the book as a whole is peppered with a staggering range of literary puzzles and allusions, acrostics, problems of chess and logic, crosswords, and mathematical formulae.

Though a member of a prominent local family and at one time a successful lawyer, Loursat now shuns and is shunned by polite society–which suits him fine. He prefers to spend his evenings leafing through the books in his library and drinking Bordeaux. Loursat does his best to ignore the presence of his teenage daughter, paying little attention to the questionable activities that seem to be going on in his vast, old, ever-more dilapidated house. But then, one night, the sound of a gunshot penetrates the padded walls of Loursat’s study. He leaves the security of his wing of the house to investigate. What he stumbles on is a case of murder. Loursat begins to discover something of the secret life of his daughter and her circle of friends, young people from all levels of local society. He finds himself strangely drawn to this group, and when one of them is accused of the murder, he astonishes all by taking up the young man’s defense.

Separated from his pregnant wife and young daughter in the chaos of flight, he joins a freight car of refugees hurtling southward ahead of the pursuing invaders. There, he meets Anna, a sad-looking, dark- haired girl, whose accent is “neither Belgian nor German,” and who “seemed foreign to everything around her.” As the mystery of Anna’s identity is gradually revealed, Marcel leaps from the heights of an exhilarating freedom to the depths of a terrifying responsibility—one that will lead him to a blood-chilling decision.

Georgette Heyer,The Grand Sophy,,English,,"When the redoubtable Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy is ordered to South America on business, he leaves his only daughter Sophia with his sister, Elizabeth Rivenhall, in Berkeley Square. Newly arrived from her tour of the Continent, Sophy invites herself into the circle of her relatives. When Lady Ombersley agrees to take in her young niece, no one expects Sophy, who sweeps in and immediately takes the town by storm. Beautiful, gay, impulsive, shockingly direct, Sophy sweeps into elegant London society and scatters conventions and traditions before her like wisps in a windstorm. Resourceful, adventurous and utterly indefatigable, Sophy is hardly the mild-mannered girl that the Rivenhalls expect when they agree to take her in. Kind-hearted Aunt Lizzy is shocked, and her arrogant stern cousin Charles Rivenhall, the Ombersley heir, vows to rid his family of her meddlesome ways by marrying her off.But vibrant and irrepressible Sophy was no stranger to managing delicate situations. After all, she'd been keeping opportunistic females away from her widowed father for years. Staying with her relatives could be her biggest challenge yet. But Sophy discovers that her aunt's family is in desperate need of her talent for setting everything right: her aunt's husband is of no use at all, her ruthlessly handsome cousin Charles has tyrannical tendencies that are being aggravated by his pedantic bluestocking fiancee Eugenia Wraxton; her lovely cousin Cecelia is smitten with an utterly unsuitable suitor, a beautiful but feather-brained poet; her cousin Herbert is in dire financial straits and has fallen foul of a money-lender; and the younger children are in desperate need of some fun and freedom, and Sophy's arrived just in time to save them all. With her inimitable mixture of exuberance and grace, Sophy becomes the mainstay of her hilariously bedeviled family, as a horsewoman, social leader and above all, as an ingenious match-maker. Using her signature unorthodox methods, Sophy sets out to solve all of their problems. By the time she's done, Sophy has commandeered household and Charles's horses, but she finds herself increasingly drawn to her eldest cousin. Could it be that the Grand Sophy had finally met her match? Can she really be falling in love with him, and he with her?

He is madly in love with the beautiful Julia Oversley, but he soon realises that the drastic measure of a marriage of convenience is the only answer. It is Lord Oversley, father of Adam's first love, who tactfully introduces him to Mr Jonathan Chaleigh, a City man of apparently unlimited wealth with no social ambitions for himself, but with his eyes firmly fixed on a suitable match for his one and only daughter, the quiet and decidedly plain Jenny Chawleigh.Although Jenny Chawleigh was bright, well-mannered, and an heiress, she was no match for beautiful Julia Oversley, the love of handsome Adam Deveril's life. But Adam desperately needed money to keep his fatherless family together, and a marriage to Jenny would solve all his problems. And Jenny's father, a man of great wealth and ambition for his daughter, was only too happy to arrange a suitable match with a title for her. Adam chafes under Mr. Chawleigh's generosity, and Julia's jealous behavior upon hearing of the betrothal nearly brings them all into a scandal. But Adam didn't reckon with the Jenny nobody knew, or the unknown quality that lay hidden behind her demure and plain facade, who bring him comfort and eventually more....",,,10/29/61,June 2nd 2005,"['Adam Deveril, Viscount Lynton', 'Jenny Chawleigh']",Paperback,"['Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Regency', 'Historical Romance', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Regency Romance', 'Classics', 'British Literature', 'Adult']",,9780099474449,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1370388195l/311132.jpg,3.8,[],235.0,3.0,,311132.A_Civil_Contract,,,,,90.0,6827.0,375,,Arrow,"['2008', '2239', '1919', '519', '142']",,,[],,

Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),Praise to the Man,,,,"Written with a dramatic intensity and an eye for historical detail that thousands of readers have come to appreciate in previous volumes, Praise to the Man — volume 6 in the series The Work and the Glory — follows the story of the restored Church and of the ficitonal Steed family from the summer of 1841 to the summer of 1844. Several momentous events take place during this period in Church history: Nauvoo becomes a well-established city; the Relief Society is founded; the endowment is administered for the first time in this dispensation; Joseph Smith becomes a candidate for president of the United States; he delivers his monumental King Follett Discourse. Meanwhile, however, dark forces outside as well as inside the Church are at work to destroy Joseph and the Restoration cause. Before the story ends, the powers of evil will have swept across the Church, taking out some in very high places, making numerous others waver, and taking Joseph and his brother Hyrum to their date with destiny in a town called Carthage. Woven throughout these events are the lives of the Steeds. As Joshua sees the Mormons gaining more influence with his wife and children, his patience finally reaches the breaking point. Will must resolve his feelings for Jenny Pottsworth and his desire to know if the Church is true. New hope is born in Jessica's life when she is offered a new teaching position. Mary Ann and other Steed women participate in the beginnings of the Relief Society. But before long, whisperings reach the ears of some of the Steeds about curious teachings and practices going on in Nauvoo — specifically it is rumored that God may have restored the ancient practice of plural marriage. How will they respond when they find out that at least some of the rumors are true? The issue becomes a trial of faith that shakes the Steed family to its very roots. At the center of this volume are the final days of the life and mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Though heart-wrenching in its depiction of the Prophet's last hours on earth, this book inspires admiration and affection for “the man who communed with Jehovah” and will fill readers with anticipation for that glorious time when, in the words of the hymn, “millions shall know 'Brother Joseph' again.”",The Work and the Glory #6,,10/29/95,October 10th 1998,[],Audio Cassette,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian Fiction', 'Spirituality']",,9781570085482,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1197090757l/625649.jpg,4.36,[],230.0,3.0,,625649.Praise_to_the_Man,,,,,98.0,8546.0,733,,Bookcraft,"['4477', '2880', '1039', '128', '22']",,,"['Nauvoo, Illinois (United States)']",,

Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),Pillar of Light,,,,"""You believe me, don't you, Nathan."" It was not a question, but a statement, filled with wonder.It stunned Nathan.""You believe it all. I can see it on your face.""For a moment, time seemed suspended as Nathan probed the inward recesses of his soul. There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was. He knew without the least shadow of doubt that everything Joseph was telling him was true. And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, ""Yes, Joseph, I believe you.""Pillar of Light — the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory — begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions — intensely personal, potentially divisive — will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.",The Work and the Glory #1,,10/01/94,November 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction']",,9781590383636,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416338631l/625554.jpg,4.28,[],310.0,4.0,,625554.Pillar_of_Light,,,,,97.0,15323.0,437,,Deseret Book Company,"['7528', '5260', '2040', '361', '134']",,,[],,
Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),Fire of the Covenant: The Story of the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies,,English,,"In the summer of 1856, three companies of handcarts were outfitted and sent west from Iowa to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. All went well, and they arrived without undue incident. But two additional companies - one captained by James G. Willie, and the other by Edward Martin - left England late in the season. When they arrived at Iowa City, they were long past the time for safe departure across the plains. By the time they left Florence, Nebraska, with still more than a thousand miles to go, it was near the end of August. As if that were not serious enough, President Brigham Young thought that the arrival of the third company ended the migration for that season and ordered the resupply wagons back to Salt Lake. Fire of the Covenant is the story of those handcart pioneers and their exodus to the Salt Lake Valley. Author Gerald N.

""Because there is yet work to be done,"" he said in awe.Joseph laughed softly. ""That is exactly what I concluded. There is still much to be done. We have to establish the kingdom of God on the earth so that the kingdom of heaven may come. That takes men and women who have iron faith and steel in their commitment to the Lord."" He put both hands on Benjamin's shoulders. ""And if the Lord has to take us through the fires to find enough metal to do the job, then I say, let the fires begin. I, for one, am ready.""In Thy Gold to Refine, volume 4 in the series The Work and the Glory, the story of the fictional Steed family enters one of the stormiest and yet most inspiring periods in Church history.Picking up where Volume 3 left off in the summer of 1838, this book finds the Steeds, (all but daughter Melissa and her family) happily reunited in Far West, Missouri, only to be thrown into a maelstrom of intense and tragic events: the election-day battle at Gallatin; the siege of DeWitt; the Battle of Crooked River; the issuing of Governor Bogg's extermination order; the Haun's Mill massacre; the fall of Far West; the incarceration of the Prophet Joseph Smith; and the expulsion from Missouri. Characters whom readers have come to know and love from previous volumes return here, including Joshua Steed, who, although reconciled to his family now, finds that his commission in the Missouri state militia forces him to be alighted with those opposing the Mormons.Once again author Gerald Lund skillfully recreates dramatic scenes from Latter-day Saint history, transporting readers back in time to witness soul-stirring events and to meet unforgettable people.

In addition, since this period in Church history is not without its tensions, its trials, and its tragedies, members of the Steed family experience all of these as well. Through some of the most realistic and tender scenes of the series, readers will come to know these beloved characters even more intimately than ever before. As with the previous volumes, personalities from Church history come to vivid life here, particularly those of the incomparable Joseph Smith and the faithful, steadfast Brigham Young. Here, then, is another exciting, engaging installment in this acclaimed series, a story that reveals God's infinite mercy and wisdom in granting his people a season of relief, a season of hope, a season of joy.",The Work and the Glory #5,,12/08/94,July 17th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Spirituality', 'Adult Fiction']",,9781590386644,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1176430193l/625555.jpg,4.32,[],78.0,1.0,,625555.A_Season_of_Joy,,,,,98.0,9442.0,600,,Deseret Book Company,"['4674', '3309', '1281', '152', '26']",,,"['Nauvoo, Illinois (United States)']",,
Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),No Unhallowed Hand,,,,"“Joshua,” said Brigham, “three years ago, Joseph wrote to a Mr. John Wentworth, and one of the things he said was this. 'The standard of truth has been erected, and no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing. It will not stop until the purposes of God are accomplished and the great Jehovah shall say to us, the work is done!'”Now Brigham's voice quivered with excitement; his eyes burned with intensity. “That's what we're offering here, Joshua. Those men with their painted faces stormed Carthage Jail and thought they had stopped the work. Well, what an enormous shock this will be to them! They're driving us from the state, thinking that will end it. But give us ten years. Fifteen years! And then even a blind man will know that no unhallowed hand can stop this work.”Picking up the story shortly after the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, No Unhallowed Hand — volume 7 in the series The Work and the Glory — takes the saga of the Restoration the the fictional Steed family from the end of June 1844 to February 1846.As this volume opens, it is a time of great sadness and of uncertainty. Having lost their beloved prophet, the Saints witness a series of power plays by those who would use the opportunity to further their own interests. It is not long, however, before the Lord's purposes are made apparent and the Twelve take their rightful position as leaders of the Church, with Brigham Young at their head. For a time, an uneasy peace seems to prevail in Illinois, but then the Nauvoo Charter is revoked, anti-Mormon hatred is again inflamed by those involved in the Prophet's death, mobs burn homes in small Mormon settlements, and eventually the Saints again find themselves faced with the threat of violent expulsion unless they agree to leave the state. The situation promises to divide the Steeds. Who among them will go west and who will stay? What will Joshua's and Melissa's part-member families do?This installment in the series contains not only its share of fascinating real-life history, but also a number of plot twists involving the Steeds that will keep readers engaged from beginning to end. The story of their lives underscores the prophetic nature of Joseph Smith's words that, indeed, “no unhallowed hand can stop the work.”",The Work and the Glory #7,,10/15/96,February 1st 2007,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Spirituality', 'Adult Fiction', 'Christian Fiction']",,9781590387252,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266601545l/625561.jpg,4.34,[],80.0,1.0,,625561.No_Unhallowed_Hand,,,,,98.0,8831.0,656,,Deseret Book,"['4508', '3015', '1149', '140', '19']",,,[],,

Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),All Is Well,,,,"All Is Well, the powerful and moving ninth volume of the series The Work and the Glory, brings to a close the Restoration-era portion of this epic story. It follows the fictional Steed family from June 1846 to October 1847 as they participate in some of the most pivotal and dramatically charged events in Church history, including the migration of the Saints from the banks of the Missouri River to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake.As this volume opens, the Steeds have been scattered — and the family is only split up further as the story unfolds. Will and Alice's voyage aboard the Brooklyn nears its end as the ship approaches the California shore. Peter and Kathryn continue their journey westward in the Donner-Reed party. In Nauvoo, Melissa and Carl find their situation growing increasingly dangerous and their marriage more and more strained. Other Steed family members are temporarily encamped at the Missouri River, where the Saints will set up winter quarters. When the United States government, at war with Mexico, calls for five hundred Mormon volunteers to form a battalion, some of the Steeds march with that battalion in its history-making trek across the continents. Meanwhile, other family members become part of the pioneer companies that, at last, establish in the West a place of refuge for the Saints.As with the previous books in the series, this volume is populated with a host of interesting characters, both fictional and historical. And even though throughout most of the story the Steeds are separated from one another, hope remains that somehow all of them will be reunited, and with the rest of the Saints they will make the chorus swell: “All is well! All is well!”",The Work and the Glory #9,,07/10/98,February 1st 2007,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Fiction']",,9781590387276,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266601542l/625559.jpg,4.32,[],163.0,2.0,,625559.All_Is_Well,,,,,97.0,7665.0,744,,Deseret Book,"['3899', '2531', '1019', '190', '26']",,,[],,

Yet for her, headline events were only the backdrop to a less obvious but more enduring drama: the daily life of Muslim women. Nine Parts of Desire is the story of Brooks' intrepid journey toward an understanding of the women behind the veils, and of the often contradictory political, religious, and cultural forces that shape their lives. Defying our stereotypes about the Muslim world, Brooks' acute analysis of the world's fastest growing religion deftly illustrates how Islam's holiest texts have been misused to justify repression of women, and how male pride and power have warped the original message of a once liberating faith.",,,10/29/94,December 1st 1995,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Islam', 'Religion', 'History', 'Feminism', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Travel', 'Sociology', 'Gender']",,9780385475778,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403182793l/337615.jpg,4.04,[],234.0,4.0,,337615.Nine_Parts_of_Desire,,,,,95.0,12892.0,255,,Anchor,"['4366', '5437', '2500', '435', '154']",,,[],,
Geraldine Brooks (Goodreads Author),Caleb's Crossing,,English,,"A richly imagined new novel from the author of the New York Times bestseller, People of the Book.   Once again, Geraldine Brooks takes a remarkable shard of history and brings it to vivid life. In 1665, a young man from Martha's Vineyard became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard College. Upon this slender factual scaffold, Brooks has created a luminous tale of love and faith, magic and adventure.  The narrator of Caleb's Crossing is Bethia Mayfield, growing up in the tiny settlement of Great Harbor amid a small band of pioneers and Puritans. Restless and curious, she yearns after an education that is closed to her by her sex. As often as she can, she slips away to explore the island's glistening beaches and observe its native Wampanoag inhabitants. At twelve, she encounters Caleb, the young son of a chieftain, and the two forge a tentative secret friendship that draws each into the alien world of the other. Bethia's minister father tries to convert the Wampanoag, awakening the wrath of the tribe's shaman, against whose magic he must test his own beliefs. One of his projects becomes the education of Caleb, and a year later, Caleb is in Cambridge, studying Latin and Greek among the colonial elite. There, Bethia finds herself reluctantly indentured as a housekeeper and can closely observe Caleb's crossing of cultures.  Like Brooks's beloved narrator Anna in Year of Wonders, Bethia proves an emotionally irresistible guide to the wilds of Martha's Vineyard and the intimate spaces of the human heart. Evocative and utterly absorbing, Caleb's Crossing further establishes Brooks's place as one of our most acclaimed novelists.Watch a Video",,,05/01/11,May 3rd 2011,"['Bethia Mayfield', 'Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck', 'Makepeace Mayfield', 'Joel Iacoomis']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Native Americans', 'Religion', '17th Century']",,9780670021048,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1303284000l/9684523.jpg,3.82,"[""Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Nominee for Fiction (2011)"", 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for Literary Fiction (2012)', 'Chautauqua Prize Nominee (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2011)', 'David J.

Geraldine Brooks (Goodreads Author),People of the Book,,English,,"From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of March, the journey of a rare illuminated manuscript through centuries of exile and warIn 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famed Sarajevo Haggadah, which has been rescued from Serb shelling during the Bosnian war. Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding—an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair—she begins to unlock the book’s mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book’s journey from its salvation back to its creation. In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city’s rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah’s extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna’s investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love. Inspired by a true story, People of the Book is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.",,,01/28/08,October 1st 2008,"['Hanna Heath', 'Ozren Karaman', 'Serif Kamal', 'Stela Kamal', 'Amitai Yomtov', 'Werner Heinrich', 'Razmus Kanaha', 'Dr. Franz Hirschfeldt', 'Florien Mittl', 'Giovanni Domenico Vistorini', 'Judah Aryeh', 'Sarah Heath', 'David Ben Shoushan', 'Ruth Ben Shoushan', 'Joseph Ben Shoushan', 'Reuben Ben Shoushan', 'Rosa del Salvador', 'Zahra bint Ibrahim al-Tarek', 'Aaron Sharansky']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Books About Books', 'Mystery', 'Book Club', 'Jewish', 'Religion', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442955497l/1379961._SY475_.jpg,4.02,"['National Jewish Book Award Nominee (2008)', 'Massachusetts Book Award for Fiction (2009)', ""Prime Minister's Literary Awards Nominee for Fiction (2009)"", 'Barbara Jefferis Award Nominee (2009)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for Literary Fiction and for Book of the Year (2008)', 'Mary Shelley Award for Outstanding Fictional Work (2009)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2010)']",3941.0,58.0,,1379961.People_of_the_Book,,,,,94.0,123160.0,372,,Viking Books,"['43804', '47731', '24218', '5688', '1719']",,,"['Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina']",,

Geraldine Pinch,Egyptian Myth: A Very Short Introduction,,,History,"Egyptian myths articulated the core values of one of the longest lasting civilizations in history, and myths of deities such as Isis and Osiris influenced contemporary cultures and became part of the Western cultural heritage. Egyptian Mythology: A Very Short Introduction explains the cultural and historical background to the fascinating and complex world of Egyptian myth, with each chapter dealing with a particular theme. To show the variety of source material for Egyptian myth, each chapter features a particular object--such as the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle, a golden statue of Tutankhamun, and a papyrus containing a story in which the Egyptian gods behave outrageously--which is illustrated by a photograph or line-drawing. The myth ""The Contendings of Horus and Seth"" is looked at in detail, and the many interpretations it has provoked are examined. In addition to a list of major deities and myths, there are explanations of related topics such as how hieroglyphs work, royal names and titles, and the Egyptian cosmos.

The poems, letters, and journal entries selected for this edition were written in the following twenty years of his life and published posthumously in 1918.His verse is wrought from the creative tensions and paradoxes of a poet-priest who wanted to evoke the spiritual essence of nature sensuously, and to communicate this revelation in natural language and speech-rhythms while using condensed, innovative diction and all the skills of poetic artifice.

Op die zomerse zeventiende juni in 1969 staat iedereen voor het polderhuis om de koningin feestelijk te begroeten. De Kaantjes, de zoons van boerderij Kaan, wapperen enthousiast met hun vlaggetjes. Als hun moeder met de kleine Hanne te laat op het feestterrein aankomt, precies op het moment dat de koningin in de auto stapt, streelt Juliana het meisje over haar wang en geeft Anna Kaan koninklijk de hand. Het zou een onvergetelijke feestdag geworden zijn, als de bakker 's middags tijdens een inhaalbezorgronde niet met zijn splinternieuwe VW-busje de in de berm spelende Hanne had geraakt. Als Jan Kaan vele jaren later op een gloeiendhete junidag van Texel komt om de grafsteen van zijn zusje op te knappen, is er meteen weer spanning en stille woede. Is het niet eindelijk tijd om tot de orde van de dag over te gaan? Moet de vergunning voor het graf nog verlengd worden?

Gerda Weissmann Klein,All But My Life: A Memoir,,English,,"All But My Life is the unforgettable story of Gerda Weissmann Klein's six-year ordeal as a victim of Nazi cruelty. From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops—including the man who was to become her husband—in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of ""all but her life."" By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda's beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century's terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome.",,,01/01/59,March 31st 1995,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'Memoir', 'History', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'War', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316131452l/163363.jpg,4.28,[],100.0,1.0,,163363.All_But_My_Life,,,,,95.0,18273.0,261,,Hill & Wang,"['9629', '5503', '2205', '524', '412']",,,[],,

Botanical Shakespeare features a gorgeous color illustration of each, giving a ""face"" to the name, alongside the specific text in which it appears and the character(s) who utter the lines in which it is mentioned.This fascinating visual compendium also includes a dictionary describing each plant—such as Eglantine, a wild rose with a slight prickle, cherished for its singular scent, superior to any other rose; and the difference between apples and apple-john—along with indices listing the botanical by play/poem, by character, and genus for easy reference, ideal for gardeners and thoughtful birthday gift-giving.This breathtaking, incomparable collection of exquisite artwork and companion quotes offers unique depth and insight into Shakespeare and his timeless work through the unusual perspective of the plants themselves.",,,,April 4th 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Gardening', 'Art', '21st Century', 'Nature', 'New Adult', 'Reference', 'Science', 'Poetry', 'Education']",,9780062469892,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1476816618l/30653749.jpg,4.2,[],664.0,7.0,,30653749-botanical-shakespeare,,,,,99.0,353.0,208,,Harper Design,"['137', '154', '57', '4', '1']",,,[],,

When Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch was first published it created a shock wave of recognition in women, one that could be felt around the world. It went on to become an international bestseller, translated into more than twelve languages, and a landmark in the history of the women's movement. Positing that sexual liberation is the key to women's liberation, Greer looks at the inherent and unalterable biological differences between men and women as well as at the profound psychological differences that result from social conditioning. Drawing on history, literature, biology, and popular culture, Greer's searing examination of women's oppression is a vital, passionately argued social commentary that is both an important historical record of where we've been and a shockingly relevant treatise on what still remains to be achieved.",,,10/28/70,March 5th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Gender', 'Politics', 'Womens', 'Classics', 'Sociology', 'Gender Studies', 'History']",,9780374527624,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312002051l/98532.jpg,3.71,[],276.0,5.0,,98532.The_Female_Eunuch,,,,,89.0,6046.0,400,,Farrar Straus Giroux,"['1436', '2223', '1739', '489', '159']",,,[],,

Hidden secrets, healing factors and horrific violence all collide as Deadpool's misplaced quest for vengeance threatens to blow up in his face. But as DP and SB battle tooth and claw, what is Victor Creed's fellow Uncanny X-Man Magneto going to do about it? Meanwhile, the Mercs For Money make moolah in the mouthy one's name while Wade tries to come to terms with being a global hero and an Avenger, after a lifetime as an inveterate degenerate.

Gertrude Stein,How to Write,,English,,"First published in 1931, this book contains Gertrude Stein’s thoughts about the craft of writing. It is written in her usual experimental style, yet it is not difficult to understand, and even traditionalists will find that it has many things to say to them.Her experimental style includes such elements as disconnectedness, a love of refrain and rhyme, a search for rhythm and balance, a dislike of punctuation (especially the comma), a dismissal of the conventional significance of words, and a repetition of words and phrases. Her approach to writing is impossible to summarize, but many critics see a strain of American humor in her work, borne out immediately by some of the chapter titles: “Saving the Sentence,” “Arthur a Grammar,” “Regular Regularly in Narrative,” and “Finally George a Vocabulary.”Readers who have not encountered Gertrude Stein or who have had difficulty with her other work will find this book useful as an entry into her writing.

Regarded by some critics as a minor masterpiece, Three Lives was Stein's first published book. In it she tells the stories of three working class women — Anna, a conscientious but rigid serving woman; Melanctha, a worldly-wise and sensitive black girl; and Lena, a gentle but feeble-minded maid.Although these are relatively ordinary women, in Stein's hands their lives and minds take on extraordinary interest.

I'm named after a drink.''Tequila Sunrise,' I murmured.'No,' pouted the child. 'Tequila Braithwaite.'Now in his fourth year as an Inspector for English in the Yorkshire Dales, Gervase Phinn still relishes visiting the schools - whether an inner-city comprehensive fraught with difficulties or a small Dales Primary school where the main danger is one of closure. With endless good humour, he copes with the little surprises that occur round every corner.Some things never change: Mrs Savage roars, Connie rants, and Gervase's colleague in the office play verbal ping-pong. But all this can be put behind him each day when he returns home to his lovely wife, Christine, who is expecting their first baby.

Gesine Bullock-Prado,Confections of a Closet Master Baker: One Woman's Sweet Journey from Unhappy Hollywood Executive to Contented Country Baker,,English,,"
  A former Hollywood insider trades the Hollywood Hills for Green Acres
—
  and lives to tell about it in this hilarious, poignant treat of a memoir.
As head of her celebrity sister’s production company, Gesine Bullock-Prado had a closet full of designer clothes and the ear of all the influential studio heads, but she was miserable. The only solace she found was in her secret hobby: baking. With every sugary, buttery confection to emerge from her oven, Gesine took one step away from her glittery, empty existence—and one step closer to her true destiny. Before long, she and her husband left the trappings of their Hollywood lifestyle behind, ending up in Vermont, where they started the gem known as Gesine Confectionary. And they never looked back. Confections of a Closet Master Baker follows Gesine's journey from sugar-obsessed child to miserable, awkward Hollywood insider to reluctant master baker. Chock-full of eccentric characters, beautifully detailed descriptions of her baking process, ceaselessly funny renditions of Hollywood nonsense, and recipes, the ingredients of her story will appeal to anyone who has ever considered leaving the life they know and completely starting over.",,,10/30/09,September 8th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Cooking', 'Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Foodie', 'Biography Memoir', 'Food', 'Biography', 'Cookbooks', 'Culinary', 'Autobiography']",,9780767932684,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320392440l/6267708.jpg,3.74,[],99.0,1.0,,6267708-confections-of-a-closet-master-baker,,,,,91.0,2720.0,226,,Broadway Books,"['663', '979', '840', '190', '48']",,,[],,

"Ghalib Lakhnavi, Abdullah Bilgrami, Musharraf Ali Farooqi (Translator)",Hamzanama: The Adventures of Amir Hamza,,English,,"In the tradition of such beloved classics as ""The Thousand and One Nights"" and the Persian"" Shahnameh,"" here is the first unabridged English translation of a major Indo-Persian epic, ""The Adventures of Amir Hamza"" (Dastan-e Amir Hamza)—a panoramic tale of magic and passion, and a classic hero's odyssey that has captivated much of the world.This Islamic saga dates back hundreds of years, perhaps to as early as the seventh century, when oral narratives of the deeds of the prophet Muhammad's uncle Amir Hamza spread through Arabia, Persia, and the Indian subcontinent, expanding into a marvelous chronicle of warriors, kings, tricksters, fairies, courtesans, and magical creatures. The definitive one-volume Urdu text by Ghalib Lakhnavi and Abdullah Bilgrami appeared toward the end of the nineteenth century, but English translations of this text have always been censored and abridged-until now.In Musharraf Ali Farooqi's faithful rendition, ""The Adventures of Amir Hamza"" is captured with all its colorful action, ribaldry, and fantastic elements intact. Here is the spellbinding story of Amir Hamza, the adventurer who loves Mehr-Nigar, the daughter of the Persian emperor, Naushervan. Traveling to exotic lands in the service of his emperor, Amir Hamza defeats many enemies, loves many women, and converts hundreds of infidels to the True Faith of Islam before finding his way back to his first love. Guided by a Merlin-like clairvoyant called Buzurjmehr, protected by legendary prophets, and accompanied by his loyal friend, the ingenious trickster Amar Ayyar, Amir Hamza rides his devoted winged demon-steed, Ashqar, into combat against a marvelous array of opponents, from the deadly demon, Sufaid Dev, to his own rebellious sons.Appreciated as the seminal Islamic epic or enjoyed as a sweeping tale as rich and inventive as Homer's epic sagas, ""The Adventures of Amir Hamza"" is an extraordinary creation and a true literary treasure.",,,11/06/55,October 23rd 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'India', 'Islam', 'Epic', '19th Century', 'Literature', 'Indian Literature', 'Religion']",,9780679643548,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266609006l/655785.jpg,3.82,[],66.0,1.0,,655785.Hamzanama,,,,,92.0,177.0,992,,Modern Library,"['46', '72', '45', '10', '4']",,,[],,

"Ghassan Kanafani, غسان كنفاني",موت سرير رقم 12,,Arabic,,"""موت سرير رقم 12"" هي المجموعة القصصية الأولى التي أصدرها غسان كنفاني. وقد صدرت في بيروت عام 1961 بمقدمة قصيرة كتبها المؤلف يقول فيها: ""أنا أؤمن أن الكتاب يجب أن يقدم نفسه، وإذا عجز عن إحراز جزء من طموح كاتبه، فعلى الكاتب أن يقبل ذلك ببساطة، كما قبل -مرات ومرات- أن يمزق قصصاً ليعيد كتابتها. وهكذا ""فموت سرير رقم 12"" أدفعها لتشق طريقها، إن استطاعت أن تهتدي إلى أول الطريق، بنفسها، دون شفاعة ودون وساطة ودون جواز مرور"". ولأنها المجموعة الأولى، فإن ""موت سرير رقم 12"" تحمل الاتجاهات الرئيسية التي كانت تجربة كنفاني الإبداعية تحاول اكتشافها وبلورتها. نستطيع أن نميز ثلاثة خطوط رئيسية في المجموعة: الخط الأول: هو الخط الفلسطيني، إذا صح التعبير، حيث تبرز القصة القصيرة بوصفها استجماعاً للخطة التاريخية واستنطاقاً للذاكرة في سبيل صياغة رؤية فلسطينية جديدة تنطلق من الواقع المعاش ومن احتمالاته المتعددة. وفي هذه القصص يبرز النبض الحار لنثر كنفاني وقدرته على تكثيف اللحظات النثرية في رؤية تمزج بين مرارة الواقع وإمكانيات تغييره. الخط الثاني: خط المعاينة الواقعية، حيث يقدم كنفاني مجموعة من القصص الواقعية التي تصف حياة الناس في الخليج (حيث كان يقيم)، وسوف تكون هذه المحاولات الواقعية البذرة التي ستنمو وتتطور في كتابات كنفاني اللاحقة. الخط الثالث: هو خط طرح الأسئلة على الوجود، من سؤال محمد علي أكبر حول الموت، إلى سؤال قصة ""الأرجوحة"" حول الحب والعلاقات الإنسانية. هذه الخطوط ليست متوازية، بل إنها تتقاطع في أكثر من قصة ليشكل تقاطعها النبرة الخاصة التي استطاع كنفاني أن يؤسسها في القصة العربية القصيرة. فمن خلال تقاطع الخطين الأول والثاني، سوف تبرز رواية ""رجال في الشمس"" لتقدم من خلال واقع الفلسطينيين المهاجرين إلى الخليج صورة رمزية للواقع الفلسطيني والعربي بأسره. كما سيتطور هذا الخط في رواية ""أم سعد"" ليقدم لوحة نضالية عن تجربة المخيم الفلسطيني وسط القتال. وسيسمح الاتجاه الثالث لكنفاني أن يكتب روايته ""الأعمى والأطرش"" التي استشهد قبل إكمالها، ولكنها تعبر عن الكيفية الجديدة التي تطرح فيها أسئلة الوجود داخل التجربة الفلسطينية.لتحميل الرواية من هذا الرابط :https://goo.gl/QaY553",,4,,January 1st 1987,[],Paperback,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Novella', 'Historical Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1280863217l/6375489.jpg,4.07,[],100.0,1.0,,6375489-12,,,,,95.0,2712.0,194,,مؤسسة الأبحاث العربية,"['985', '1085', '512', '99', '31']",,,[],,

"Giacomo Leopardi, Michael Caesar (Editor), Franco D'Intino (Editor)",Zibaldone,,English,,"A groundbreaking translation of the epic work of one of the great minds of the nineteenth century. (Jonathan Galassi's translation of Leopardi's Canti was published by FSG in 2010.)Giacomo Leopardi was the greatest Italian poet of the nineteenth century and was recognized by readers from Nietzsche to Beckett as one of the towering literary figures in Italian history. To many, he is the finest Italian poet.He was a prodigious scholar of classical literature and philosophy, and a voracious reader in numerous ancient and modern languages. For most of his writing career, he kept an immense notebook, known as the Zibaldone, or ""hodge-podge,"" as Harold Bloom has called it, in which Leopardi put down his original, wide-ranging, radically modern responses to his reading. His comments about religion, philosophy, language, history, anthropology, astronomy, literature, poetry, and love are unprecedented in their brilliance and suggestiveness, and the Zibaldone, which was only published at the turn of the twentieth century, has been recognized as one of the foundational books of modern culture. Its 4,500-plus pages have never been fully translated into English until now, when a team under the auspices of Michael Caesar and Franco D'Intino of the Leopardi Centre in Birmingham, England, have spent years producing a lively, accurate version. This essential book will change our understanding of nineteenth-century culture.

In Leading From the Center, Gil Troy argues that this is a distinctly un-American state of affairs. The great presidents of American history have always sought a golden mean-from Washington, who brilliantly mediated between the competing visions of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, to Lincoln, who rescued the Union with his principled pragmatism, to the two Roosevelts, who united millions of Americans with their powerful, affirmative, nationalist visions. As America lines up to select a president for the future, Gil Troy astutely reminds us of the finest traditions of presidential leadership from our nation's past.",,,June 9th 2008,June 10th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['American History', 'Nonfiction']",,9780465002931,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347808426l/3392459.jpg,3.4,[],27.0,1.0,,3392459-leading-from-the-center,,,,,80.0,10.0,304,,Basic Books,"['1', '5', '2', '1', '1']",,,[],,
Gil Troy (Goodreads Author),Morning in America: How Ronald Reagan Invented the 1980's,,English,,"Did America's fortieth president lead a conservative counterrevolution that left liberalism gasping for air? The answer, for both his admirers and his detractors, is often yes. In Morning in America, Gil Troy argues that the Great Communicator was also the Great Conciliator. His pioneering and lively reassessment of Ronald Reagan's legacy takes us through the 1980s in ten year-by-year chapters, integrating the story of the Reagan presidency with stories of the decade's cultural icons and watershed moments-from personalities to popular television shows. One such watershed moment was the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. With the trauma of Vietnam fading, the triumph of America's 1983 invasion of tiny Grenada still fresh, and a reviving economy, Americans geared up for a festival of international harmony that-spurred on by an entertainment-focused news media, corporate sponsors, and the President himself-became a celebration of the good old U.S.A. At the Games' opening, Reagan presided over a thousand-voice choir, a 750-member marching band, and a 90,000-strong teary-eyed audience singing America the Beautiful! while waving thousands of flags. Reagan emerges more as happy warrior than angry ideologue, as a big-picture man better at setting America's mood than implementing his program. With a vigorous Democratic opposition, Reagan's own affability, and other limiting factors, the eighties were less counterrevolutionary than many believe. Many sixties' innovations went mainstream, from civil rights to feminism. Reagan fostered a political culture centered on individualism and consumption-finding common ground between the right and the left. Written with verve, Morning in America is both a major new look at one of America's most influential modern-day presidents and the definitive story of a decade that continues to shape our times.-- ""Library Journal""",,,01/24/05,March 1st 2007,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'American History']",,9780691130606,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347375201l/486913.jpg,3.67,[],55.0,2.0,,486913.Morning_in_America,,,,,90.0,70.0,417,,Princeton University Press,"['14', '30', '19', '3', '4']",,,[],,
Gil Vicente,Auto da Barca do Inferno,,Portuguese,,"Trata-se de uma alegoria dramática: duas são as barcas em que os personagens podem subir - a do Inferno, munida do Diabo; e a da Glória, encabeçada pelo Anjo. Em cena, é realizado o auto do julgamento das almas, e a maior parte delas segue na primeira barca. Entre os ""réus"", um agiota, um sapateiro rico, um tolo, uma alcoviteira, um usurário, quatro cavaleiros e um frade corrupto, além de outros representantes da humanidade. Muito mais do que uma sátira da sociedade lisboeta em princípios do século 16, mais do que uma farsa ou um auto de moralidade (embora também o seja), ""Auto da Barca do Inferno"" é um bem-humorado arrazoado dos vícios que corroem o mundo e uma crítica – infelizmente ainda válida – à organização da sociedade dos homens.Gil Vicente é considerado o primeiro dramaturgo da língua portuguesa.reimpressão, 2009",,,10/28/17,2005,[],Mass Market Paperback,"['Classics', 'Plays', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Portugal', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'Poetry', 'Theatre']",,9788525414458,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1233688552l/4992047.jpg,3.66,[],346.0,4.0,,4992047-auto-da-barca-do-inferno,,,,,89.0,8240.0,72,,L&PM,"['1675', '3102', '2575', '754', '134']",,,[],,

Gilbert Adair,The Dreamers,,English,,"Gilbert Adair's novel is set in Paris in the spring of 1968. The city is beginning to emerge from hibernation and an obscure spirit of social and political renewal is in the air. Yet Théo, his twin sister Isabelle and Matthew, an American student they have befriended, think only of immersing themselves in another, addictive form of hibernation: moviegoing at the Cinémathèque Française. Night after night, they take their place beside their fellow cinephiles in the very front row of the stalls and feast insatiably off the images that flicker across the vast white screen.Denied their nightly 'fix' when the French government suddenly orders the Cinémathèque's closure, Théo, Isabelle and Matthew gradually withdraw into a hermetically sealed world of their own creation, an airless universe of obsessive private games, ordeals, humiliations and sexual jousting which finds them shedding their clothes and their inhibitions with equal abandon. A vertiginous free fall interrupted only, and tragically, when the real world outside their shuttered apartment succeeds at last in encroaching on their delirium.The study of a triangular relationship whose perverse eroticism contrives nevertheless to conserve its own bruised purity, brilliant in its narrative invention and startling in ints imagery, The Dreamers (now a film by Bernardo Bertolucci) belongs to the romantic French tradition of Les Enfants Terribles and Le Grand Meaulnes and resembles no other work in recent British fiction.",,,10/28/88,February 19th 2004,"['Isabelle', 'Théo', 'Matthew']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'LGBT', 'France', '20th Century', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Literature']",,9780571216260,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348492990l/624641.jpg,3.56,"[""Authors' Club Best First Novel Award (1988)""]",352.0,4.0,,624641.The_Dreamers,,,,,82.0,2402.0,208,,Faber Faber,"['590', '755', '632', '263', '162']",,,['Paris (France)'],,

Although the British fleet was victorious over the Germans, the cost in ships and men was high, and debates have raged within British naval circles ever since about why the Royal Navy was unable to take advantage of the situation.

Gilbert Hernández,Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories,,English,,"For the first time ever, Fantagraphics is proud to present a single-volume collection of Gilbert Hernandez's ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories from Love & Rockets, which along with RAW magazine defined the modern literary comics movement of the post-underground generation. This massive volume collects every ""Heartbreak Soup"" story from 1993 to 2002 in one 500-page deluxe hardcover edition, presenting the epic for the first time as the single novel it was always intended to be. Palomar is the mythical Central American town where the ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories take place. The stories weave in and out of the town's entire population, crafting an intricate tapestry of Latin American experience. Hernandez's densely plotted and deeply imagined tales are often compared with magic realist authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende (House of the Spirits). His depictions of women and Mexican-American experience have been universally lauded as the best examples the artform has to offer. Luba, the guiding spirit of Palomar since the outset, has been hailed by The Nation, Rolling Stone, and Time magazine as one of the great characters of contemporary American fiction. Hernandez's work, in addition to the obvious magic realist comparisons, shares an affinity with other Latin American and Spanish writer/artists, like Frida Kahlo, Federico Garcia Lorca and Pablo Picasso, all of whom applied a surrealist eye to what they saw and experienced. Palomar follows the lives of its residents from Luba's arrival in the town to her exit, twenty years later. Included are such classic tales as ""Sopa de Gran Pena,"" ""Ecce Homo,"" ""An American in Palomar,"" ""Human Diastrophism,"" and ""Farewell, Mi Palomar.""

Gilbert Sinoué,Le souffle du jasmin,,French,,"È il maggio del 1816 e a Londra i ministri degli Esteri britannico e francese stanno per firmare un accordo che segnerà inesorabilmente le sorti di una parte del mondo cruciale dal punto di vista politico ed economico: il Medio Oriente. L’Impero Ottomano infatti ha i giorni contati e la sua caduta sta per lasciare un vuoto di potere dall’Egitto all’Iraq al Libano alla Palestina. Inglesi e francesi si spartiscono le future zone di influenza in un patto segreto tra le loro diplomazie, noto alla storia come «trattato Sykes-Picot».Ma, chiede Jean-François Levent, un giovane diplomatico francese presente alla firma degli accordi, e gli arabi? «Gli arabi non esistono, sono solo un miserabile aggregato di tribù, piccole fazioni gelose le une delle altre e incapaci di coesione », è la sprezzante risposta del ministro inglese. Parole che provocherebbero incredulità e indignazione se le udisse Hussein Shahid, produttore di agrumi in Palestina, o Farid Lufti, coltivatore di cotone al Cairo, o Nidal El-Safi, colto patriarca di un’influente famiglia di Baghdad. Queste tre famiglie arabe, così come i Tarbush di Haifa, o come la famiglia ebrea dei Marcus, fuggita dai pogrom della Polonia per stabilirsi in Palestina, conducono la loro esistenza in una maniera ben diversa da quella immaginata dai ministri occidentali. Seguono rispettosamente tradizioni millenarie, ma allo stesso tempo sono culturalmente aperte, capaci di convivere in sintonia e amicizia con arabi di diverse origini e con gli ebrei.Tuttavia, mentre i pazienti e colti patriarchi non si capacitano che le potenze occidentali possano sul serio intervenire in maniera tanto profonda e inconsapevole nella loro terra, i loro figli già inneggiano a rivolte contro i traditori e invasori, i quali addirittura si dice abbiano avvallato l’apertura agli ebrei di un numeroso e indipendente insediamento in Palestina.Murad Shahid figlio di Hussein, Taymur Lufti, giovane egiziano, Shams e Dunia El-Safi, fratelli iracheni, continuano a vivere la loro vita fatta di istruzione e lavoro, nuovi sentimenti, trascurabili incomprensioni con i propri padri e piccole ribellioni contro inglesi e francesi, ma negli animi loro e dei loro coetanei si insinuano ferite inguaribili che porteranno alla nascita di nazionalismi locali e del fondamentalismo arabo, con odi violenti tra popolazioni che da secoli vivevano in armonia sotto un lontano giogo.Prima opera di una serie dedicata al Medio Oriente, La terra dei gelsomini mostra lo straordinario talento di Gilbert Sinoué nel restituirci in forma romanzata le trasformazioni avvenute nel Ventesimo secolo in quel lembo di terra e le responsabilità delle incomprensioni, dei tradimenti, dei massacri tra le popolazioni locali e nei confronti dell’Occidente",Inch' Allah #1,,11/05/10,,[],Paperback,"['France', 'Fiction', 'Roman', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical Romance']",,9782081219106,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362254800l/8143390.jpg,3.88,[],74.0,1.0,,8143390-le-souffle-du-jasmin,,,,,94.0,271.0,,,,"['82', '96', '76', '12', '5']",,,[],,

"Gilbert Sorrentino, Christopher Sorrentino (Preface)",The Abyss of Human Illusion,,English,,"“To the novel—everyone’s novel—Sorrentino brings honor, tradition, and relentless passion.”—Don DeLillo“Sorrentino [is] a writer like no other. He’s learned, companionable, ribald, brave, mathematical, at once virtuosic and somehow without ego. Sorrentino’s books break free of the routine that inevitably accompanies traditional narrative and through a passionate renunciation shine with an unforgiving, yet cleansing, light.”—Jeffrey Eugenides“For a compelling, hilarious, and ultimately compassionate rendering of life in mid-20th-century America, forget the conscientious subjectors and take Gilbert Sorrentino at his golden Word.”—Harry Mathews“One of [Brooklyn]’s most intriguing and authentic homegrown talents, Sorrentino’s Bay Ridge deserves to be appreciated alongside Malamud’s Crown Heights, Arthur Miller’s Coney Island, Henry Miller’s and Betty Smith’s Williamsburg, Hamill’s and Auster’s Park Slope, and Lethem’s Boerum Hill.”—BookforumTitled after a line from Henry James, Gilbert Sorrentino’s final novel consists of fifty narrative set pieces full of savage humor and cathartic passion—an elegiac paean to the bleak world he so brilliantly captured in his long and storied career. Mirroring the inexplicable coincidences, encounters, and hallmarks of modern life, this novel revisits familiar characters—the aging artists, miserable couples, crackerjack salesmen, and drunken soldiers of previous books, placing them in familiar landscapes lost in time between the Depression era and some fraudulent bohemia of the present.A luminary of American literature, Gilbert Sorrentino was a boyhood friend of Hubert Selby, Jr., a confidant of William Carlos Williams, a two-time PEN/Faulkner Award finalist, and the recipient of a Lannan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award.

More than ten years ago, he lay buried under a pile of burning bodies. The centuries–old battle between Hutu and Tutsi tribes had come to Gilbert's school. Fueled by hatred, the Hutus forced more than a hundred Tutsi children and teachers into a small room and used machetes to beat most of them to death. The unfortunate ones who survived the beating were doused with gasoline and set on fire. After hiding under burning bodies for over eight hours, Gilbert heard a voice inside saying, ""You will be all right; you will survive."" He knows it was God speaking to him. Gilbert was the lone survivor of the genocide, and thanks his enduring faith in God for his survival.Today, having forgiven his enemies and moved forward with his life, he is a world–class athlete, running coach and celebrity in his new hometown of Austin, Texas. The road to this point has been a tough one, but Gilbert uses his survival instincts to spur him on to the goal of qualifying for the 2008 Olympic Summer Games.

A tribe of Native Americans had made her their weroanza—a word that meant ""big chief"". The news was received with great joy, both by the Queen and her favorite, Sir Walter Ralegh. His first American expedition had brought back a captive, Manteo, who caused a sensation in Elizabethan London. In 1587, Manteo was returned to his homeland as Lord and Governor, with more than one hundred English men, women, and children. In 1590, a supply ship arrived at the colony to discover that the settlers had vanished.For almost twenty years the fate of Ralegh's colonists was to remain a mystery. When a new wave of settlers sailed to America to found Jamestown, their efforts to locate the lost colony were frustrated by the mighty chieftain, Powhatan, father of , who vowed to drive the English out of America. Only when it was too late did the settlers discover the incredible news that Ralegh's colonists had survived in the forests for almost two decades before being slaughtered in cold blood by henchmen. While Sir Walter Ralegh's ""savage"" had played a pivotal role in establishing the first English settlement in America, he had also unwittingly contributed to one of the earliest chapters in the decimation of the Native American population.

Together, they had created a majority Christian city that was unique in the Islamic world. But to the Turkish nationalists, Smyrna was a city of infidels.In the aftermath of the First World War and with the support of the Great Powers, Greece had invaded Turkey with the aim of restoring a Christian empire in Asia. But by the summer of 1922, the Greeks had been vanquished by Atatürk's armies after three years of warfare. As Greek troops retreated, the non-Muslim civilians of Smyrna assumed that American and European warships would intervene if and when the Turkish cavalry decided to enter the city. But this was not to be.On September 13, 1922, Turkish troops descended on Smyrna. They rampaged first through the Armenian quarter, and then throughout the rest of the city. They looted homes, raped women, and murdered untold thousands. Turkish soldiers were seen dousing buildings with petroleum. Soon, all but the Turkish quarter of the city was in flames and hundreds of thousands of refugees crowded the waterfront, desperate to escape. The city burned for four days; by the time the embers cooled, more than 100,000 people had been killed and millions left homeless.Based on eyewitness accounts and the memories of survivors, many interviewed for the first time, Paradise Lost offers a vivid narrative account of one of the most vicious military catastrophes of the modern age.",,,11/06/08,July 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Greece', 'Historical', '20th Century', 'Islam', 'Politics']",,9780465011193,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328841549l/3271565.jpg,4.2,[],92.0,1.0,,3271565-paradise-lost,,,,,96.0,595.0,426,,Basic Books,"['251', '237', '83', '22', '2']",,,[],,

One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the 1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now, his talents were put to more devious use: he built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler's favorite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another, William Fairbairn, was a portly pensioner with an unusual passion: he was the world's leading expert in silent killing, hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind enemy lines.

Gilles Deleuze,Nietzsche and Philosophy,,,Philosophy,"Praised for its rare combination of scholarly rigor and imaginative interpretation, Nietzsche and Philosophy has long been recognized as one of the most important analyses of Nietzsche. It is also one of the best introductions to Deleuze's thought, establishing many of his central philosophical positions. In Nietzsche and Philosophy, Deleuze identifies and explores three crucial concepts in Nietzschean thought-multiplicity, becoming, and affirmation-and clarifies Nietzsche's views regarding the will to power, eternal return, nihilism, and difference. For Deleuze, Nietzsche challenged conventional philosophical ideas and provided a means of escape from Hegel's dialectical thinking, which had come to dominate French philosophy. He also offered a path toward a politics of difference. In this new edition, Michael Hardt's foreword examines the profound influence of Deleuze's provocative interpretations on the study of Nietzsche, which opened a whole new avenue in postwar thought.",,,,2006.0,,,,0231138768,9780231138765,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KGaYQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.16,,,,,,,,,,,,256.0,,,,48.0,,,,
"Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Brian Massumi (Translator)",A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,,English,,"Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII. He is a key figure in poststructuralism, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. Felix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst at the la Borde Clinic, as well as being a major social theorist and radical activist. A Thousand Plateaus is part of Deleuze and Guattari's landmark philosophical project, Capitalism and Schizophrenia - a project that still sets the terms of contemporary philosophical debate. A Thousand Plateaus provides a compelling analysis of social phenomena and offers fresh alternatives for thinking about philosophy and culture.

"Gilles Deleuze, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Jean McNeil (Translator)",Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty & Venus in Furs,,English,,"In his stunning essay, Coldness and Cruelty, Gilles Deleuze provides a rigorous and informed philosophical examination of the work of the late 19th-century German novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Deleuze's essay, certainly the most profound study yet produced on the relations between sadism and masochism, seeks to develop and explain Masoch's ""peculiar way of 'desexualizing' love while at the same time sexualizing the entire history of humanity."" He shows that masochism is something far more subtle and complex than the enjoyment of pain, that masochism has nothing to do with sadism; their worlds do not communicate, just as the genius of those who created them - Masoch and Sade - lie stylistically, philosophically, and politically poles a part. Venus in Furs, the most famous of all of Masoch's novels was written in 1870 and belongs to an unfinished cycle of works that Masoch entitled The Heritage of Cain. The cycle was to treat a series of themes including love, war, and death. The present work is about love. Although the entire constellation of symbols that has come to characterize the masochistic syndrome can be found here - fetishes, whips, disguises, fur-clad women, contracts, humiliations, punishment, and always the volatile presence of a terrible coldness - these do not eclipse the singular power of Masoch's eroticism.",,,02/01/67,August 5th 1991,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Sexuality', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Literary Criticism', 'Classics', 'Erotica', 'France']",,9780942299557,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349037274l/94654.jpg,4.03,[],99.0,1.0,,94654.Masochism,,,,,93.0,1242.0,296,,Zone Books,"['452', '476', '233', '63', '18']",,,[],,

Gilles Néret,Gustav Klimt: 1862-1918,,English,,"Cult of pleasure: Feminine sensuality by the Vienna Secession's greatest proponentGustav Klimt's ornate, sensual, and decadent style made him not only the most prominent of the Vienna Secessionists but one of the best loved artists of all time. In his own time, Kilmt (1862-1918) was a highly successful painter, draftsman, muralist, and graphic artist; in the intervening years, iconic works such as The Kiss have been elevated to nothing less than cult status. Klimt's unfading popularity attests to the appeal of not only his aesthetic sensibilities but also that of the recurrent universal themes in his work: love, feminine beauty, aging, and death. He once wrote, ""I am a painter who paints day after day from morning to night...Who ever wants to know something about me...ought to look carefully at my pictures."" With this overview of Klimt's work, readers will delight in taking up that challenge.About the Series:  Each book in TASCHEN's Basic Art series features:a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance a concise biography approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions",,,10/30/92,August 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Art History', 'Reference', 'History', 'Adult', 'Visual Art', 'Design', 'Art and Photography']",,9783822859803,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393794080l/103902.jpg,4.14,[],125.0,3.0,,103902.Gustav_Klimt,,,,,93.0,19630.0,96,,Taschen,"['9259', '5722', '3282', '904', '463']",,,[],,

Thankfully, he had the talent to back it up. But when he meets a girl who makes him think twice about exactly what being a hero means, he starts to wonder if following in his brother’s footsteps might be all wrong.

Ginger Strand,"Inventing Niagara: Beauty, Power and Lies",,English,,"Americans call Niagara Falls a natural wonder, but the Falls aren't very natural anymore. In fact, they are a study in artifice. Water diverted, riverbed reshaped, brink stabilized and landscape redesigned, the Falls are more a monument to man's meddling than to nature's strength. Held up as an example of something real, they are hemmed in with fakery -- waxworks, haunted houses, IMAX films and ersatz Indian tales. A symbol of American manifest destiny, they are shared politely with Canada. Emblem of nature's power, they are completely human-controlled. Archetype of natural beauty, they belie an ugly environmental legacy still bubbling up from below. On every level, Niagara Falls is a monument to how America falsifies nature, reshaping its contours and redirecting its force while claiming to submit to its will.Combining history, reportage and personal narrative, ""Inventing Niagara"" traces Niagara's journey from sublime icon to engineering marvel to camp spectacle. Along the way, Ginger Strand uncovers the hidden history of America's waterfall: the Mohawk chief who wrested the Falls from his adopted tribe, the revered town father who secretly assisted slave catchers, the wartime workers who unknowingly helped build the Bomb and the building contractor who bought and sold a pharaoh. With an uncanny ability to zero in on the buried truth, Strand introduces us to underwater dams, freaks of nature, mythical maidens and 280,000 radioactive mice buried at Niagara.From LaSalle to Lincoln to Los Alamos, Mohawks to Marilyn, Niagara's story is America's story, a tale of dreams founded on the mastery of nature. At a time of increasing environmental crisis, ""Inventing Niagara"" shows us how understanding the cultural history of nature might help us rethink our place in it today.",,,10/30/08,May 6th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Science', 'American History', 'The United States Of America']",,9781416546566,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441113197l/1627127._SY475_.jpg,3.85,['Orion Book Award Nominee (2009)'],99.0,1.0,,1627127.Inventing_Niagara,,,,,91.0,181.0,337,,Simon & Schuster,"['51', '72', '41', '13', '4']",,,[],,

It's a book to relish, to read and re-read. Unforgettable."" --Salmon RushdieAn electrifying memoir from the acclaimed Nicaraguan writer (""A wonderfully free and original talent""--Harold Pinter) and central figure in the Sandinista Revolution.Until her early twenties, Gioconda Belli inhabited an upper-class cocoon: sheltered from the poverty in Managua in a world of country clubs and debutante balls; educated abroad; early marriage and motherhood. But in 1970, everything changed. Her growing dissatisfaction with domestic life, and a blossoming awareness of the social inequities in Nicaragua, led her to join the Sandinistas, then a burgeoning but still hidden organization. She would be involved with them over the next twenty years at the highest, and often most dangerous, levels.Her memoir is both a revelatory insider's account of the Revolution and a vivid, intensely felt story about coming of age under extraordinary circumstances. Belli writes with both striking lyricism and candor about her personal and political lives: about her family, her children, the men in her life; about her poetry; about the dichotomies between her birth-right and the life she chose for herself; about the failures and triumphs of the Revolution; about her current life, divided between California (with her American husband and their children) and Nicaragua; and about her sustained and sustaining passion for her country and its people.",,,11/06/01,October 14th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Biography', 'Spanish Literature', 'Autobiography', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Latin American', 'Feminism']",,9781400032167,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386749350l/61030.jpg,4.19,[],88.0,1.0,,61030.The_Country_Under_My_Skin,,,,,95.0,2047.0,380,,Anchor Books,"['914', '733', '307', '71', '22']",,,[],,

In this remarkable novel, Gioia Diliberto tells Virginie's story, drawing on the sketchy historical facts to re-create Virginie's tempestuous personality and the captivating milieu of nineteenth-century Paris. Born in New Orleans and raised on a lush plantation, Virginie fled to France during the Civil War, where she was absorbed into the fascinating and wealthy world of grand ballrooms, dressmakers' salons, and artists' ateliers. Even before Sargent painted her portrait, Virginie's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of vicious Paris gossip.

"Giorgio Agamben, Daniel Heller-Roazen (Translator)",Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life,,English,,"The work of Giorgio Agamben, one of Italy’s most important and original philosophers, has been based on an uncommon erudition in classical traditions of philosophy and rhetoric, the grammarians of late antiquity, Christian theology, and modern philosophy. Recently, Agamben has begun to direct his thinking to the constitution of the social and to some concrete, ethico-political conclusions concerning the state of society today, and the place of the individual within it.In Homo Sacer, Agamben aims to connect the problem of pure possibility, potentiality, and power with the problem of political and social ethics in a context where the latter has lost its previous religious, metaphysical, and cultural grounding. Taking his cue from Foucault’s fragmentary analysis of biopolitics, Agamben probes with great breadth, intensity, and acuteness the covert or implicit presence of an idea of biopolitics in the history of traditional political theory. He argues that from the earliest treatises of political theory, notably in Aristotle’s notion of man as a political animal, and throughout the history of Western thinking about sovereignty (whether of the king or the state), a notion of sovereignty as power over “life” is implicit.The reason it remains merely implicit has to do, according to Agamben, with the way the sacred, or the idea of sacrality, becomes indissociable from the idea of sovereignty. Drawing upon Carl Schmitt’s idea of the sovereign’s status as the exception to the rules he safeguards, and on anthropological research that reveals the close interlinking of the sacred and the taboo, Agamben defines the sacred person as one who can be killed and yet not sacrificed—a paradox he sees as operative in the status of the modern individual living in a system that exerts control over the collective “naked life” of all individuals.",Homo Sacer #I,,11/06/94,April 1st 1998,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Italy', 'Anthropology']",,9780804732185,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547126393l/85826._SY475_.jpg,4.04,[],91.0,1.0,,85826.Homo_Sacer,,,,,92.0,4163.0,208,,Stanford University Press,"['1691', '1398', '731', '234', '109']",,,[],,
"Giorgio Agamben, Jeff Fort (Translator)",Profanations,,English,,"The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has always been an original reader of texts, understanding their many rich historical, aesthetic, and political meanings and effects. In Profanations, Agamben has assembled for the first time some of his most pivotal essays on photography, the novel, and film. A meditation on memory and oblivion, on what is lost and what remains, Profanations proves yet again that Agamben is one of the most provocative writers of our time. In ten essays, Agamben ponders a series of literary and philosophical problems: the relation among genius, ego, and theories of subjectivity; the problem of messianic time as explicated in both images and lived experience; parody as a literary paradigm; and the potential of magic to provide an ethical canon.The range of topics and themes addressed here attest to the creativity of Agamben's singular mode of thought and his persistent concern with the act of witnessing, sometimes futile, sometimes earth-shattering. -In Praise of Profanity, - the central essay of this short but dense book, confronts the question of profanity as the crucial political task of the moment. An act of resistance to every form of separation, the concept of profanation reorients perceptions of how power, consumption, and use interweave to produce an urgent political modality and desire: to profane the unprofanable. Agamben not only provides a new and potent theoretical model but describes it with a writerly style that itself forges inescapable links among literature, politics, and philosophy.",,,11/05/05,November 1st 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Essays', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Literature', 'Film', 'Art']",,9781890951825,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347624009l/919661.jpg,4.11,[],75.0,1.0,,919661.Profanations,,,,,95.0,393.0,99,,Zone Books (NY),"['157', '146', '71', '14', '5']",,,[],,

But it is not until 1938 that he is invited behind the walls of their lavish estate, as local Jews begin to gather there to avoid the racial laws of the Fascists, and the garden of the Finzi-Continis becomes a sort of idyllic sanctuary in an increasingly brutal world.

Giorgio De Santillana;Hertha von Dechend,Hamlet's Mill,An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time,,Philosophy,"Ever since the Greeks coined the language we commonly use for scientific description, mythology and science have developed separately. But what came before the Greeks? What if we could prove that all myths have one common origin in a celestial cosmology? What if the gods, the places they lived, and what they did are but ciphers for celestial activity, a language for the perpetuation of complex astronomical data? Drawing on scientific data, historical and literary sources, the authors argue that our myths are the remains of a preliterate astronomy, an exacting science whose power and accuracy were suppressed and then forgotten by an emergent Greco-Roman world view. This fascinating book throws into doubt the self-congratulatory assumptions of Western science about the unfolding development and transmission of knowledge. This is a truly seminal and original thesis, a book that should be read by anyone interested in science, myth, and the interactions between the two.",,,,1977.0,,,,0879232153,9780879232153,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ql7ATHGee50C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.27,,,,,,,,,,,,450.0,,,,458.0,,,,
Giorgio Faletti,Appunti di un venditore di donne,,Italian,,"1978. A Roma le Brigate Rosse hanno rapito Aldo Moro, in Sicilia boss mafiosi come Gaetano Badalamenti soffocano ogni tentativo di resistenza civile, all’ombra della Madonnina le bande criminali di Vallanzasca e Turatello fanno salire la tensione in una città già segnata dagli scontri sociali. Ma anche in questo clima la dolcevita del capoluogo lombardo, che si prepara a diventare la «Milano da bere» degli anni Ottanta, non conosce soste. È proprio tra ristoranti di lusso, discoteche, bische clandestine e cabaret - dove cresce una nuova generazione di uomini di spettacolo destinata a rivoluzionare la comicità italiana - che fa i suoi affari un uomo enigmatico, affascinante, reso cinico da una menomazione inflittagli per uno «sgarbo». Si fa chiamare Bravo. Il suo settore sono le donne. Lui le vende. La sua vita è una lunga notte bianca che trascorre in compagnia di disperati, come l’amico Daytona. L’unico essere umano con cui pare avere un rapporto normale è un vicino di casa, Lucio, formidabile chitarrista cieco con cui condivide la passione per i crittogrammi. La comparsa improvvisa di una ragazza, Carla, che per sfuggire alla povertà decide di entrare nel giro della prostituzione, risveglia dolorosamente in Bravo sensazioni che l’handicap aveva messo a tacere. Ma per lui non è l’inizio di una nuova vita - che comunque gli sarebbe preclusa - bensì di un incubo che lo trasformerà in un uomo braccato dalla polizia, dalla malavita e da un’organizzazione terroristica. Incastrato come capro espiatorio in una serie di omicidi e in una strage efferata, per salvarsi non potrà contare che su se stesso. Il mondo, cui aveva cercato di sottrarsi scegliendo l’oscurità alla luce del giorno, lo risucchia mettendolo faccia a faccia con la violenza del proprio tempo. Qualcosa di molto più grosso di lui che fa sembrare acqua cristallina i suoi traffici sporchi.",,Romanzi e racconti Baldini Castoldi Dalai #513,11/06/10,November 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Thriller', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Italian Literature', 'Noir', 'Novels', 'Italy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller']",,9788860735393,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1294597159l/9922078.jpg,3.8,[],93.0,1.0,,9922078-appunti-di-un-venditore-di-donne,,,,,91.0,1621.0,397,,Baldini Castoldi Dalai,"['411', '648', '420', '110', '32']",,,[],,

Carducci's credentials as a Satanist include not only his worldly successes and overt opposition to Christianity but his writing of the highly controversial poem, Inno a Satana or ""Hymn to Satan."" In writing, publicly reciting and twice publishing this astounding poem, he stepped firmly beyond his paganism and even his anti-clericalism into the realm of modern Satanism by embracing the mythic character of Satan as an exemplary role model and heroic archetypal symbol.

Sebbene appartenga cronologicamente al primo periodo della produzione verghiana, esso se ne distacca sensibilmente sia nella struttura sia nei contenuti. Scritto in forma epistolare, è tratto da un'esperienza autobiografica. Le lettere che la giovane Maria - costretta dal padre alla vita del convento senza vocazione - scrive all'amica Marianna durante un breve soggiorno con la famiglia in campagna, testimoniano del suo turbamento di giovane novizia che al di fuori della vita monacale riscopre nuovi orizzonti, e soprattutto l'esistenza dell'amore che, osteggiato da tutti, crescerà in lei assumendo una tensione parossistica.

Verga's style is swift, sure, and implacable; he plunges into his stories almost in midbreath, and tells them with a stark economy of words. There's something dark and tightly coiled at the heart of each story, an ironic, bitter resolution that is belied by the deceptive simplicity of Verga's prose, and Verga strikes just when the reader's not expecting it. Translator D. H. Lawrence surely found echoes of his own upbringing in Verga's sketches of Sicilian life: the class struggle between property owners and tenants, the relationship between men and the land, and the unsentimental, sometimes startlingly lyric evocation of the landscape. Just as Lawrence veers between loving and despising the industrial North and its people, so too Verga shifts between affection for and ironic detachment from the superstitious, uneducated, downtrodden working poor of Sicily. If Verga reserves pity for anyone or anything, it is the children and the animals, but he doesn't spare them.

Gish Jen (Goodreads Author),Typical American,,English,,"From the beloved author of Mona in the Promised Land and The Love Wife comes this comic masterpiece, an insightful novel of immigrants experiencing the triumphs and trials of American life.  Gish Jen reinvents the American immigrant story through the Chang family, who first come to the United States with no intention of staying. When the Communists assume control of China in 1949, though, Ralph Chang, his sister Theresa, and his wife Helen, find themselves in a crisis. At first, they cling to their old-world ideas of themselves.  But as they begin to dream the American dream of self-invention, they move poignantly and ironically from people who disparage all that is “typical American” to people who might be seen as typically American themselves. With droll humor and a deep empathy for her characters, Gish Jen creates here a superbly engrossing story that resonates with wit and wisdom even as it challenges the reader to reconsider what a typical American might be today.",,,10/30/91,May 14th 1998,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'China', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'American', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Asian Literature', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction']",,9781862071117,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170506864l/58307._SY475_.jpg,3.42,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (1991)'],152.0,2.0,,58307.Typical_American,,,,,85.0,1490.0,304,,Granta Books,"['199', '504', '568', '163', '56']",,,[],,
Gita Trelease (Goodreads Author),Enchantée,,English,,"Paris in 1789 is a labyrinth of twisted streets, filled with beggars, thieves, revolutionaries—and magicians...When smallpox kills her parents, Camille Durbonne must find a way to provide for her frail, naive sister while managing her volatile brother. Relying on petty magic—la magie ordinaire—Camille painstakingly transforms scraps of metal into money to buy the food and medicine they need. But when the coins won’t hold their shape and her brother disappears with the family’s savings, Camille must pursue a richer, more dangerous mark: the glittering court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.With dark magic forbidden by her mother, Camille transforms herself into the ‘Baroness de la Fontaine’ and is swept up into life at the Palace of Versailles, where aristocrats both fear and hunger for la magie. There, she gambles at cards, desperate to have enough to keep herself and her sister safe. Yet the longer she stays at court, the more difficult it becomes to reconcile her resentment of the nobles with the enchantments of Versailles. And when she returns to Paris, Camille meets a handsome young balloonist—who dares her to hope that love and liberty may both be possible.But la magie has its costs. And when Camille loses control of her secrets, the game she's playing turns deadly. Then revolution erupts, and she must choose—love or loyalty, democracy or aristocracy, freedom or magic—before Paris burns…",Enchantée #1,,,February 5th 2019,"['Camille Durbonne', 'Sophie Durbonne', 'Ètienne Bellan, Marquis de Chandon', 'Lazare Mellais']",Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Audiobook']",,9781250231963,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542046529l/36613718._SY475_.jpg,3.71,[],194.0,2.0,,36613718-enchant-e,,,,,90.0,5977.0,449,,Flatiron/Macmillan,"['1332', '2314', '1722', '503', '106']",,,['Paris (France)'],,

From an affectionate alcoholic, to the classic New York City commitment-phobe, to a hipster aged past his sell date, and not one, but two novelists with Peter Pan complexes, Giulia has cooked for them all.

Peppered throughout Giulia's delightful and often poignant remembrances are fond recollections of her mother's cooking, the recipes she learned from her, and many she invented on her own inspired by the men in her life.

Giản Tư Trung,Đúng việc,,Vietnamese,,"... Nhiều năm trước, tôi có dịp lang thang trên quảng trường Trafalgar ở thủ đô London của nước Anh. Đây là quảng trường được xây dựng để kỷ niệm chiến thắng của hải quân Anh trong trận chiến Trafalgar lừng danh do Đô đốc Nelson chỉ huy. Nằm ngay vị trí trung tâm của quảng trường là một chiếc cột cao 52 mét mà ở trên đỉnh cột là bức tượng vị đô đốc tài ba đứng sừng sững giữa trời. Nhưng điều khiến tôi chú ý nhất không phải là bức tượng sừng sững đó, mà là một dòng chữ ở tấm điêu khắc gần chân cột: “England expects that every man will do his duty”. (Tạm dịch: Nước Anh mong muốn mỗi người sẽ làm tròn công việc/bổn phận của mình).Đó chính là lời hiệu triệu nổi tiếng mà đô đốc Nelson đã gửi cho hạm đội của mình trước trận Trafalgar. Nhưng tôi nghĩ, chọn khắc dòng chữ này ở một trong những vị trí được xem như “trái tim” của nước Anh; người Anh không chỉ đơn thuần muốn kỷ niệm một trận chiến mà có lẽ muốn gửi gắm vào đó nhiều thông điệp hơn thế.Mỗi công dân Anh (và cả những người không phải là người Anh) khi đứng trước những dòng chữ này hẳn sẽ ít nhiều suy tư về những “công việc” hay “bổn phận” của mình: chúng là gì, và mình đã làm chưa; nếu đã làm thì đã làm đúng và làm tốt/làm tròn những công việc ấy hay chưa?“Công việc của mình” - Mấy chữ trên tấm phù điêu về trận chiến Trafalgar năm ấy cũng đã ít nhiều bắt đầu gợi lên và gieo vào trong tôi những suy tư về mình, về thời cuộc, và đặc biệt là về những “trận chiến” diễn ra ở ngay xứ sở của mình. Những suy tư đó đã thực sự thôi thúc tôi muốn viết một điều gì đó về “công việc”, về làm đúng và làm tốt “công việc”, về những “trận chiến” liên quan đến bản chất và chân giá trị của mọi vấn đề.Đó không phải là những trận chiến hữu hình giữa người với người, giữa gươm với súng như trong quá khứ; mà là những trận chiến giữa cái đúng và cái sai, giữa khai minh và vô minh, giữa cõi phàm và cõi thiêng, giữa cái cao đẹp và cái thấp hèn của con người. Những cuộc chiến vô hình ấy cũng khốc liệt và có sức tàn phá khủng khiếp không kém bất kỳ cuộc chiến hữu hình nào: Các thang giá trị trong xã hội bị đảo lộn; con người bị cuốn vào những vòng xoáy hỗn mang, nghi ngờ chính những điều đã từng được coi là chân-thiện-mỹ; công việc nào, lĩnh vực nào, ngành nghề nào, vấn đề nào cũng có những điều được xem là “vấn nạn chưa có lời giải”.Bất kỳ ai chứng kiến và cảm nhận những điều đó hẳn cũng sẽ đau đáu một câu hỏi nhân sinh như tôi: Căn nguyên của những gì đang diễn ra trong xã hội này, căn nguyên của những vấn đề mà con người ngày nay đang gặp phải là gì và do đâu?...- trích Đôi lời từ tác giả",,,,November 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Education', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Business']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447688973l/27840432._SY475_.jpg,4.19,[],100.0,1.0,,27840432-ng-vi-c,,,,,94.0,738.0,326,,NXB Trí Thức,"['326', '277', '94', '33', '8']",,,[],,

The research highlights that such questions are vital, since people who lack a rich sense of purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose comes from traditional sources such as cultural heritage and religion. While this guidance works for some, unfortunately traditional sources of meaning and purpose do not speak nearly so well to others who want an evidence-based approach in which they can be truly confident.

And yet, time and time again, we all seem to make the same thinking errors that threaten or sabotage these relationships. These errors are called cognitive bias, and they happen when our brain attempts to simplify information by making assumptions.Grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), The Blindspots Between Us reveals the most common “hidden” cognitive biases that blind us to the truth, and which lead to the misunderstandings that damage our relationships. With this guide, you’ll learn key skills to help you debias—to stop, pause, and objectively observe situations before jumping to conclusions about others’ motives. You’ll also learn to consider other people’s points of view and past experiences before rushing to judgment and potentially undermining your relationships.Being a human is hard.

Want to avoid business disasters, whether minor mishaps, such as excessive team conflict, or major calamities like those that threaten bankruptcy or doom a promising career?

By combining practical case studies with cutting-edge research, Never Go With Your Gut will help you make the best decisions and prevent these business disasters.The leading expert on avoiding business disasters, Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, draws on over 20 years of extensive consulting, coaching, and speaking experience to show how pioneering leaders and organizations—many of them his clients—avoid business disasters.

Intrigues swirl around the throne of the Grail Empire, as the imperial family's enemy Anne of Menand raises money to help the perpetually indebted Patriarch finance his crusades. To reduce his own vulnerability, sickly young Emperor Lothar assigns his two half-sisters--his immediate heirs--to their own realms. Now Piper Hecht learns that the legendary sorceror Cloven Februaren, referred to as the Ninth Unknown, is still alive, more than 100 years old, and on Piper's side. As the dynastic politics of the Empire become even more convoluted, it's clear that while the old gods may be fading, they're determined to do everything they can to bend the doings of men to their own advantage.   Sieges, explosions, betrayals, Anti-Patriarchs, and suspicious deaths will ensue as the great chess game plays itself out, with Piper Hecht at the center of it all…",Instrumentalities of the Night #2,,,February 20th 2007,['Piper Hecht'],Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'War', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Epic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Alternate History']",,9780765306852,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390370323l/126747.jpg,4.0,[],23.0,1.0,,126747.Lord_of_the_Silent_Kingdom,,,,,96.0,1307.0,496,,Tor Books,"['403', '568', '282', '39', '15']",,,[],,

At the same time, the half-mad Empress Katrin wants him to lead the armies of the Grail Empire eastward on a crusade against his old coreligionists the Praman. Meanwhile, all around them, the world is changing. The winters are growing longer and harder every year, and the seas are getting shallower. The far north and the high mountain ranges are going under the ice, and fast. The Wells of Power, everywhere, keep getting weaker. And the old evils, the Instrumentalities from the Time Before Time, have begun to ooze back into the world.

Glen Cook,The Tyranny of the Night,,English,,"Welcome to the world of the Instrumentalities of the Night, where imps, demons, and dark gods rule in the spaces surrounding upstart humanity. At the edges of the world stand walls of ice which push slowly forward to reclaim the land for the night. And at the world's center, in the Holy Land where two great religions were born, are the Wells of Ihrain, the source of the greatest magics. Over the last century the Patriarchs of the West have demanded crusades to claim the Wells from the Pramans, the followers of the Written. Now an uneasy truce extends between the Pramans and the West, waiting for a spark to start the conflict anew. Then, on a mission in the Holy Land, the young Praman warrior Else is attacked by a creature of the Dark-in effect, a minor god. Too ignorant to know that he can never prevail over such a thing, he fights it and wins, and in so doing, sets the terrors of the night against him. As a reward for his success, Else is sent as a spy to the heart of the Patriarchy to direct their attention away from further ventures into the Holy Lands. Dogged by hidden enemies and faithless allies, Else witnesses senseless butchery and surprising acts of faith as he penetrates to the very heart of the Patriarchy and rides alongside their armies in a new crusade against his own people. But the Night rides with him, too, sending two of its once-human agents from the far north to assassinate him. Submerged in his role, he begins to doubt his faith, his country, even his family. As his mission careens out of control, he faces unanswerable questions about his future. It is said that God will know his own, but can one who has slain gods ever know forgiveness? In The Tyranny of the Night, Glen Cook introduces a new fantasy epic for the ages.",Instrumentalities of the Night #1,,,October 31st 2006,[],Mass Market Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'War', 'Epic', 'High Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Collections']",,9780765345967,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389333071l/325398.jpg,3.7,[],22.0,1.0,,325398.The_Tyranny_of_the_Night,,,,,88.0,2037.0,505,,Tor Fantasy,"['505', '752', '530', '158', '92']",,,[],,

It celebrates the ones we hear nothing of: the brave women whose hearts and minds were broken by a life of bitter hardship. A “homesman” must be found to escort a handful of them back East to a sanitarium. When none of the county’s men steps up, the job falls to Mary Bee Cuddy—ex-teacher, spinster, indomitable and resourceful. Brave as she is, Mary Bee knows she cannot succeed alone. The only companion she can find is the low-life claim jumper George Briggs. Thus begins a trek east, against the tide of colonization, against hardship, Indian attacks, ice storms, and loneliness—a timeless classic told in a series of tough, fast-paced adventures.In an unprecedented sweep, Glendon Swarthout’s novel won both the Western Writers of America’s Spur Award and the Western Heritage Wrangler Award.

Glenn Alan Cheney (Goodreads Author),Thanksgiving: : The Pilgrims' First Year in America,,English,,"""Thanksgiving"" is not about a holiday. It's about 102 people who came to the New World, suffered terribly, struggled courageously, and established the foundation of America. The prologue explores the reasons they left Europe. The book then puts the reader on the gun deck of the Mayflower where the passengers endured a horrific 66-day voyage across the Atlantic. The book puts the reader in the Pilgrims' cold, wet boots as they tromp around Cape Cod in search of a place to live as winter sets in. Though ""Thanksgiving"" holds strictly to fact, the graphic, dramatic presentation shares the Pilgrim experience. It treats the Pilgrims not as super-heroes or cartoon characters but as just plain people who were willing to face death for the values they believed in.

Glenn Beck,The Christmas Sweater,,English,,"If You Could Change Your Life by Reversing Your Biggest Regrets, Sorrows and Mistakes...Would You?#1 New York Times bestselling author and renowned radio and television host Glenn Beck delivers an instant holiday classic about boyhood memories, wrenching life lessons, and the true meaning of the gifts we give to one another in love.We weren't wealthy, we weren't poor -- we just were. We never wanted for anything, except maybe more time together....When Eddie was twelve years old, all he wanted for Christmas was a bike. Although his life had gotten harder -- and money tighter -- since his father died and the family bakery closed...Eddie dreamed that somehow his mother would find a way to have his dream bike gleaming beside their modest Christmas tree that magical morning.What he got from her instead was a sweater. ""A stupid, handmade, ugly sweater"" that young Eddie left in a crumpled ball in the corner of his room.Scarred deeply by the realization that kids don't always get what they want, and too young to understand that he already owned life's most valuable treasures, that Christmas morning was the beginning of Eddie's dark and painful journey on the road to manhood. It will take wrestling with himself, his faith, and his family -- and the guidance of a mysterious neighbor named Russell -- to help Eddie find his path through the storm clouds of life and finally see the real significance of that simple gift his mother had crafted by hand with love in her heart.Based on a deeply personal true story, The Christmas Sweater is a warm and poignant tale of family, faith and forgiveness that offers us a glimpse of our own lives -- while also making us question if we really know what's most important in them.",,,,November 11th 2008,['Eddie'],Hardcover,"['Christmas', 'Fiction', 'Inspirational', 'Holiday', 'Christian Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Christian', 'Adult', 'Family', 'Book Club']",,9781416594857,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442052035l/3268926._SX318_.jpg,3.8,[],1095.0,15.0,,3268926-the-christmas-sweater,,,,,89.0,14808.0,284,,Threshold Editions,"['4446', '5028', '3725', '1151', '458']",,,"['Mount Vernon, Washington (United States)']",,
Glenn Beck,Being George Washington,,English,,"IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW GEORGE WASHINGTON, THINK AGAIN.This is the amazing true story of a real-life superhero who wore no cape and possessed no special powers—yet changed the world forever. It’s a story about a man whose life reads as if it were torn from the pages of an action novel: Bullet holes through his clothing. Horses shot out from under him. Unimaginable hardship. Disease. Heroism. Spies and double-agents. And, of course, the unmistakable hand of Divine Providence that guided it all.Being George Washington is a whole new way to look at history. You won’t simply read about the awful winter spent at Valley Forge—you’ll live it right alongside Washington. You’ll be on the boat with him crossing the Delaware, in the trenches with him at Yorktown, and standing next to him at the Constitutional Convention as a new republic is finally born.Through these stories you’ll not only learn our real history (and how it applies to today), you’ll also see how the media and others have distorted our view of it. It’s ironic that the best-known fact about George Washington—that he chopped down a cherry tree—is a complete lie. It’s even more ironic when you consider that a lie was thought necessary to prove he could not tell one.For all of his heroism and triumphs, Washington’s single greatest accomplishment was the man he created in the process: courageous and principled, fair and just, respectful to all. But he was also something else: flawed.It’s those flaws that should give us hope for today. After all, if Washington had been perfect, then there would be no way to build another one. That’s why this book is not just about being George Washington in 1776, it’s about the struggle to be him every single day of our lives. Understanding the way he turned himself from an uneducated farmer into the Indispensable (yet imperfect) Man, is the only way to build a new generation of George Washingtons that can take on the extraordinary challenges that America is once again facing.",,,11/11/11,November 22nd 2011,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'American Revolution', 'Presidents', 'Self Help', 'Military Fiction']",,9781451659269,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348994660l/12262732.jpg,4.04,[],49.0,1.0,,12262732-being-george-washington,,,,,92.0,3289.0,287,,Threshold Editions,"['1319', '1134', '572', '165', '99']",,,[],,

Even worse, the police are mystified: the victims have nothing in common, defying all profiling, and all that connects them is that each received a sick postcard in the mail before they died - a postcard that announced their date of death.

But no matter the ups and downs, in their long, storied history the Red Sox have always managed to provide us with one thing that is certain -- they are the most interesting team ever to have taken the field. RED SOX CENTURY: ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF RED SOX BASEBALL tells the Red Sox story in its entirety for the first time, from the team's inception in 1901 and its early peak in 1918, when it won its fifth and last World Series; through the glory years, which saw the rise of such greats as Cy Young, Babe Ruth, Teddy Ballgame, and Yaz and which witnessed the ""Impossible Dream"" of 1967 and near misses in 1975 and 1986; to the present, when the Sox are still chasing that elusive sixth world championship -- a championship that fate seems not to want them to have. In these pages, many a Red Sox myth is debunked, and many stories are told for the first time.© Did the Red Sox fix the first World Series game ever played?© What is the truth about Babe Ruth and Harry Frazee?© Did Johnny Pesky hold the ball?© Does Fenway Park have a future?© Will the Red Sox ever win a World Series again?

"Glennon Doyle (Goodreads Author), Glennon Doyle Melton (Goodreads Author)",Untamed,,English,,"There is a voice of longing inside every woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good mothers, daughters, partners, employees, citizens, and friends. We believe all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives, relationships, and world, and wonder: Wasn’t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this?Four years ago, Glennon Doyle, author, activist and humanitarian, wife and mother of three—was speaking at a conference when a woman entered the room. Glennon looked at her and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high.

Glinda Izabel (Goodreads Author),Shades of Life,,English,,"Pensava che la morte fosse la fine — poi l’amore la riportò alla vita.  Juniper Lee potrebbe concedersi ogni lusso. Potrebbe viaggiare senza preoccuparsi di avere una destinazione, abbandonarsi a ogni sorta di eccesso senza temere ripercussioni. Ma non c’è nessun bene materiale che possa distrarla dalla solitudine che la divora, perché Juniper è un spettro intrappolato in una dimensione dai contorni indefiniti. . Il suo cuore non batte realmente, e tutto di lei - i suoi respiri, i suoi sorrisi, le lacrime che spesso le solcano le guance, sono solo l’eco di una vita ormai lontana. Juniper è sola e non possiede alcun ricordo. L’unica memoria che sollecita la sua mente, sin da quando si è risvegliata nella sua nuova forma spettrale, è quella di un nome. Il suo. Unica eredità della ragazza che doveva essere stata un tempo. Eppure, nonostante sembri non esserci nulla a legarla al mondo dei vivi, Juniper non riesce a seguire il raggio di luce che potrebbe aprirle le porte dell’aldilà.  Quando alla sua porta si presenta Logan, attraente ragazzo dallo sguardo scintillante, tutto per lei si tinge di nuovi e abbaglianti colori. Logan è diverso dagli altri spettri, è come se in sé nascondesse qualcosa di unico, che l’attrae in modo irresistibile. Qualcosa di inspiegabile avviene quando i due si toccano, come l’esplosione di una forza celestiale. E un ingranaggio si smuove nei recessi della mente di lei, facendole provare sensazioni mai conosciute prima. Sensazioni che profumano di ricordi sopiti e verità dimenticate. Sensazioni che potrebbero rispondere alla domanda che l’ha assillata sin dal giorno del suo risveglio: chi è davvero Juniper Lee?",,Lain,,May 28th 2013,"['Juniper Lee', 'Logan Greenwood']",Kindle Edition,"['Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Ghosts', 'Paranormal', 'Italian Literature']",,B00D2QGGWU,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386099096l/19162170.jpg,3.71,[],96.0,1.0,,19162170-shades-of-life,,,,,85.0,202.0,164,,Fazi Editore,"['53', '75', '44', '22', '8']",,,"['Savannah, Georgia (United States)']",,

None linked internal and external change together in a seamless circle of cause and effect, effect and cause. She undertook to write such a book, and ended up transforming herself as well as others. The result of her external plus internal reflection is this bestselling and truly transforming book: part collection of personal stories from her own life and the lives of many others, part revolutionary guide to finding community and inspiration. Steinem finds role models in a very young and uncertain Gandhi as well as unlikely heroes from the streets to history.

El hombre que regresa a su tierra a lamerse las heridas, como el león a su madriguera, se verá envuelto en toda clase de intrigas: políticas y de alcoba. Él, que había jurado no volver a enamorarse. Una mujer ilícita, una viuda intrigante, una joven desamparada y un antiguo amor ponen a prueba esa decisión. Entre los debates de los hacendados en la Sociedad Rural, la xenofobia en las pampas y los misterios del universo femenino, Julián Zaldívar, porteño nacido en cuna de oro, se enfrentará a los fantasmas de su propio pasado.En la más intimista de todas sus novelas, la autora pinta un fresco de la Buenos Aires de las últimas décadas del siglo XIX, con todos los matices que la convirtieron en la Reina del Plata.",,,,October 2012,[],Paperback,"['Romance', 'Historical Fiction']",,9789506442613,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1350773740l/16098291.jpg,3.94,[],96.0,1.0,,16098291-el-ngel-roto,,,,,90.0,220.0,616,,Buenos Aires: Plaza & Janés,"['82', '69', '47', '17', '5']",,,[],,

  For the first time ever, an explosive inside look at modern military police units and their role in defending our freedomAmerica has been at war on several fronts since the 9/11 attack. While public attention has focused on Marines, conventional Army units, and Special Operations Forces, a lion’s share of the war-fighting has been done, under media radar, by Military Police units. These squad and platoon-sized units patrol dangerous urban streets, build up local police units to improve neighborhood stability, and conduct civic action missions. On many occasions they have rushed into a vicious firefight to come to the assistance of infantry units in desperate straits. They keep villages Taliban-free, monitor balloting sites, and interdict drug shipments. In detention centers at Camp Bucha, Iraq, Bagram, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, Cuba they guard some of the most dangerous terrorists in history.The story is told by the soldiers themselves, recounting what they have seen and experienced, along with historical context and first-hand field observations by the author team who were provided with unique inside access. Warrior Police takes readers into the bloody streets of Iraq, the dangerous back-country of Afghanistan, and wherever our Military Police are needed.

But for Miss Temple, Roger Bascombe’s cruel rejection will ignite a harrowing quest for answers, plunging her into a mystery as dizzying as a hall of mirrors—and a remote estate where danger abounds and all inhibitions are stripped bare.Nothing could have prepared Miss Temple for where her pursuit of Roger Bascombe would take her—or for the shocking things she would find behind the closed doors of forbidding Harschmort Manor: men and women in provocative disguise, acts of licentiousness and violence, heroism and awakening. But she will also find two allies: Cardinal Chang, a brutal assassin with the heart of a poet, and a royal doctor named Svenson, at once fumbling and heroic—both of whom, like her, lost someone at Harschmort Manor. As the unlikely trio search for answers—hurtling them from elegant brothels to gaslit alleyways to shocking moments of self-discovery-- they are confronted by puzzles within puzzles. And the closer they get to the truth, the more their lives are in danger.

Gordon L. Kane,Supersymmetry and Beyond: From the Higgs Boson to the New Physics,,English,,"In Supersymmetry and Beyond, renowned physicist Gordon Kane tells the epic story of the quest to uncover a fully unified theory of physics. He introduces the theory of supersymmetry, which implies that each of the fundamental particles has a ""superpartner"" that can be detected at energies and intensities only now being achieved in the giant accelerators. If the theory is correct, these superpartners will also help solve many of the puzzles of modern physics—such as the existence of the Higgs boson—as well as one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology: the notorious ""dark matter"" of the universe.An absorbing narrative of science in the making, Supersymmetry and Beyond, now fully updated to reflect recent discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider, offers a glimpse of the cutting edge in one of the most exciting scientific ventures of our times.",,Revised Edition,,May 14th 2013,[],Paperback,"['Physics', 'Science']",,9780465082971,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357613802l/15843083.jpg,4.14,[],94.0,1.0,,15843083-supersymmetry-and-beyond,,,,,96.0,28.0,197,,Basic Books,"['10', '13', '4', '1', '0']",,,[],,

In this perilously original work, composed of six rigorously crafted parts—and informed by a desperately libidinous, grotesquely comic rage—one of the most controversial figures in contemporary American letters brilliantly captures our humanity and Zeitgeist. Central to the novel is the ravishing shriek of a man who seeks to preserve what little there is left to him. It is as if his head were in an ever-tightening vise as he frantically seeks connection with others, knowing all the while the futility of the enterprise. He yearns for some carnal knowledge. He is obsessed with the successful operation of a sexual device. His lover is insensitive, self-absorbed. What is he—a former insane asylum inmate, whose motto used to be ""share and share alike,"" but is now ""fair is fair""—supposed to do?

Gordon Lish,Collected Fictions,,English,,"In literary America, to utter the name “Gordon Lish” in a conversation is like adding hot sauce to a meal. You either enjoy the zesty experience, one that pushes your limits –– or you prefer to stay away. It’s Lish who, first as fiction editor at Esquire magazine (where he earned the nickname “Captain Fiction”) and then at the publisher Alfred A. Knopf, shaped the work of many of the country’s foremost writers, from Raymond Carver and Barry Hannah to Amy Hempel and Lily Tuck.As a writer himself, Lish’s stripped-down, brutally spare style earns accolades in increasing numbers. His oeuvre is coming to be recognized as among the most significant of the period that spans the transition between the 20th and 21st centuries. Kirkus Reviews wrote of his last collection that “Lish…is still our Joyce, our Beckett, our most true modernist.”This definitive collection of Lish’s short work includes a new foreword by the author and 106 stories, many of which Lish has revised exclusively for this edition. His observations are in turn achingly sad and wryly funny as they spark recognition of our common, clumsy humanity. There are no heroes here, except, perhaps, for all of us, as we muddle our way through life: they are stories of unfaithful husbands, inadequate fathers, restless children and writing teachers, men lost in their middle age: more often than not first-person tales narrated by one “Gordon Lish.” The take on life is bemused, satirical, and relentlessly accurate; the language unadorned: the result is a model of modernist prose and a volume of enduring literary craftsmanship.",,,,2010,[],Paperback,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1277909670l/8406239.jpg,4.12,"[""O.

Yet in this brilliantly realised study of Abraham Lincoln, he paints a surprising and near-heroic picture of the man who led America through four of the most divisive and dangerous years of the nation's history. Observed alternately by his loved ones, his rivals and his future assassins, Lincoln at first appears as an inept and naïve backwoods lawyer. People in this novel are not averse to turning up, getting drunk, and regaling the reader with details of Lincoln's whoring activities and his seemingly inexhaustible supply of folksy stories. Yet gradually Lincoln the towering leader of deep vision emerges in a Washington engulfed by fear, greed and the horrors of the Civil War. Lincoln's loving but mentally decomposing wife, his view from the White House on slavery and America's bloodiest war, and his own, fierce personal ambition: all are portrayed with a vibrancy and an urgency that almost belies what they have now become ? history itself.",,,,1994.0,,,,0349105308,9780349105307,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=59WHPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.2,,,,,,,,,,,,736.0,,,,27.0,,,,

Gore Vidal,Palimpsest,,English,,"""I am not my own subject,"" Gore Vidal used to say. But now, surprisingly, he has turned his wit and elegant storytelling gifts to a candid memoir of the first forty years of his life. Palimpsest is written from the vantage point of Vidal's library in his villa on the Italian coast. As visitors come and go, his memory ranges back and forth across a rich history. Vidal's childhood was spent in Washington, D.C., in the household of his grandfather, the blind senator from Oklahoma, T. P. Gore, and in the various domestic situations of his complicated and exasperating mother, Nina. Then come schooldays at St. Albans and Exeter; the army; life as a literary wunderkind in New York, London, Rome, and Paris in the forties and fifties; sex in an age of promiscuity; and a campaign for Congress in 1960. Vidal's famous skills as a raconteur, his forthrightness, and his wicked wit are brilliantly at work in these recollections of a difficult family, talented friends, and interesting enemies. The cast includes Tennessee Williams, the Kennedys, Eleanor Roosevelt, Truman Capote, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, Christopher Isherwood, Jack Kerouac, Jane and Paul Bowles, Santayana, Anais Nin, Norman Mailer, Leonard Bernstein, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, among others. Beautifully rendered anecdotes are intermixed with meditations on writing, history, acting, and politics. Perhaps most surprising is the leitmotif of a great, lost love. ""A memoir is how one remembers one's own life,"" Vidal says, ""while an autobiography is history."" Palimpsest is a true story, but also an extraordinary work of literary imagination.",,,10/03/95,September 1st 1996,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'LGBT', 'American', 'Queer', 'Politics']",,9780140260892,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390693289l/8715.jpg,3.99,"[""Lambda Literary Award Nominee for Gay Men's Biography/Autobiography (1996)""]",87.0,1.0,,8715.Palimpsest,,,,,95.0,1697.0,448,,Penguin Books,"['547', '695', '366', '72', '17']",,,[],,

Gore Vidal's novel 1876 gives us the news of the day through the eyes of Charlie Schuyler, who has returned from exile to regain a lost fortune and arrange a marriage into New York society for his widowed daughter.

Burr is a portrait of perhaps the most complex and misunderstood of the Founding Fathers. In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. Burr retains much of his political influence if not the respect of all. And he is determined to tell his own story. As his amanuensis, he chooses Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler, a young New York City journalist, and together they explore both Burr's past and the continuing political intrigues of the still young United States.",Narratives of Empire #1,,10/28/73,February 15th 2000,['Aaron Burr'],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literature', 'American Revolution', 'Classics']",,9780375708732,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403176864l/8722.jpg,4.07,['National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1974)'],1900.0,22.0,,8722.Burr,,,,,95.0,8564.0,430,,Vintage,"['3141', '3449', '1548', '317', '109']",,,['United States of America'],,

In Gore Vidal's Lincoln we meet Lincoln the man and Lincoln the political animal, the president who entered a besieged capital where most of the population supported the South and where even those favoring the Union had serious doubts that the man from Illinois could save it. Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections.

Gore Vidal,The Golden Age,,English,,"The Golden Age is Vidal's crowning achievement, a vibrant tapestry of American political and cultural life from 1939 to 1954, when the epochal events of World War II and the Cold War transformed America, once and for all, for good or ill, from a republic into an empire. The sharp-eyed and sympathetic witnesses to these events are Caroline Sanford, Hollywood actress turned Washington D.C., newspaper publisher, and Peter Sanford, her nephew and publisher of the independent intellectual journal The American Idea. They experience at first hand the masterful maneuvers of Franklin Roosevelt to bring a reluctant nation into the Second World War, and, later, the actions of Harry Truman that commit the nation to a decade-long twilight struggle against Communism—developments they regard with a decided skepticism even though it ends in an American global empire. The locus of these events is Washington D.C., yet the Hollywood film industry and the cultural centers of New York also play significant parts. In addition to presidents, the actual characters who appear so vividly in the pages of The Golden Age include Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Wendell Willkie, William Randolph Hearst, Dean Acheson, Tennessee Williams, Joseph Alsop, Dawn Powell—and Gore Vidal himself.The Golden Age offers up U.S. history as only Gore Vidal can, with unrivaled penetration, wit, and high drama, allied to a classical view of human fate.

From his celebrated profiles of Clare Boothe Luce and Charles Lindbergh and his controversial essay about the Bill of Rights–which sparked an extended correspondence with convicted Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh–to his provocative analyses of literary icons such as John Updike and Mark Twain and his trenchant observations about terrorism, civil liberties, the CIA, Al Gore, Tony Blair, and the Clintons, Vidal weaves a rich tapestry of personal anecdote, critical insight, and historical detail.

Gottfried von Straßburg,Tristan,,,,"Tristan und Isolde ist eine der bekanntesten Liebesgeschichten aller Zeiten. Der mutige und listige Ritter Tristan nimmt es auf sich, einen Drachen zu töten, um die schöne Isolde zu gewinnen. Im Auftrag seines Onkels. Doch die beiden jungen Menschen verfallen einer unsterblichen Liebe zueinander, die auch nach Isoldes Hochzeit nicht enden will. Sie begehen Ehebruch. Dieter Kühns kongeniale Übertragung eröffnet einen lebendigen Blick auf das sagenhafte Mittelalter, dessen Sorgen und Nöte unseren so ähnlich sind.Gottfried von Straßburg, Verfasser der um 1210 entstandenen bedeutendsten mhd. Tristandichtung. Der Name des Autors ist nur durch spätere mhd. Dichter überliefert. Lebensdaten sind keine bekannt. Ob der Beiname von Straßburg Herkunfts- oder Wirkungsort (bzw. beides) bezeichnet, ist offen. In den Handschriften wird G. in der Regel als meister (Magister) bezeichnet, Hinweis auf seine lat. Bildung. Da er nirgends als her erscheint, geht man von einer nichtadeligen Herkunft aus. Man nimmt eine Beziehung zum Straßburger Stadtpatriziat an, in dessen Kreis man auch den im Akrostichon des Prologs verschlüsselt genannten Gönner Dieterich vermutet. G. stützte sich auf eine frz. Vorlage, den 'Tristan' des Thômas von Britanje (Thomas d'Angleterre), eine um 1170 entstandene höfische Version des Stoffes, die nur bruchstückhaft überliefert ist. Das Eigene der dt. Dichtung sind zum einen die Kommentare und Reflexionen, die das vielschichtige, anspielungsreiche, ambivalente und von einer ironischen Erzählhaltung geprägte Werk durchdringen, zum andern die artistische Sprachkunst G.s, die Eleganz mit Präzision und Klarheit verbindet. Aus dieser Stilvorstellung erklärt sich vermutlich seine Attacke auf den 'dunklen' Stil Wolframs v. Eschenbach, von dem sich G. auch in seiner skeptischen Auffassung vom Rittertumund seiner eher freizügigen Einstellung in religiösen Fragen unterscheidet. Darüber hinaus steht der von G. noch verschärfte Konflikt zwischen der elementaren Gewalt autonomer Liebe und der gesellschaftlichen Ordnung in deutlichem Gegensatz zu den harmonisierenden Tendenzen des dt. Artusromans. G.s Dichtung bricht mit Vers 19 548 ab; die Fortsetzer Ulrich v. Türheim (um 1240) und Heinrich v. Freiberg (um 1290) sprechen davon, dass der Tod den Dichter an der Vollendung seines Werkes gehindert habe.Dieter Kühn, geboren 1935, ist freier Schriftsteller. Für seine Romane, Biographien, Erzählungen, Kinderbücher, Hör- und Schauspiele ausgezeichnet u. a. mit dem Hermann Hesse-Preis und dem Großen Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Schönen Künste.

Gotthold Ephraim Lessing,Emilia Galotti,,German,,"Mit dem 1772 erschienenen und uraufgeführten Drama Emilia Galotti schuf Gotthold Ephraim Lessing eines der bedeutendsten Beispiele für die Gattung des bürgerlichen Trauerspiels. Das Stück, das zu den Schlüsselwerken der Aufklärung und Empfindsamkeit gehört sowie als eines der ersten politischen Dramen der deutschen Literatur gilt, übt scharfe Kritik an der Willkürherrschaft des Adels. Dieser Macht kann das Bürgertums nur seine höhere Moral entgegensetzen. Die geplante Hochzeit der bürgerlichen Emilia Galotti mit dem ehrenhaften Grafen Appiani wird von Hettore Gonzaga, dem regierenden Prinzen von Guastalla, hintertrieben; nicht nur für Emilia endet die Intrige schließlich tödlich.

He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project.

She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things.

"Graham Brown (Goodreads Author), Spencer J. Andrews",Shadows Of The Midnight Sun,,English,,"...to enter the light, one must first confront their own darkness... In the dark corners of the world, a battle rages for the souls of the damned. They're known as The Fallen, souls afflicted with a curse that leaves them empty, violent, but immortal. The church calls them demons, vampires or the Nosferatu. For centuries a holy order known as The Righteous Fire has sought to destroy them, all the while hiding a secret that connects them, the church, to the beginning of the Nosferatu scourge. But as the events of an ancient prophecy begin to unfold, time may be running out for both groups, as the path ahead may bring forgiveness or destruction to one and all. While investigating a string of disappearances, she sees as connected to her husband's murder, FBI agent Kate Pfeiffer is drawn into this world. She begins to uncover the truth and is faced with a reality she won't believe. Soon she's caught in a clash two thousand years in the making. On one side, the righteous fire, on the other, those who dominate the world of the Fallen. Her only hope may rest with a lost soul trapped in the void between the two worlds, a jaded warrior and a man of many names who's been searching for centuries to find the truth about himself and his destiny.

To some, it's a comforting thought: no clash of civilizations, no holy wars, no terrorists.But what if that weren't the case at all? In A WORLD WITHOUT ISLAM, Graham E. Fuller guides us along an illuminating journey through history, geopolitics, and religion to investigate whether or not Islam is indeed the cause of some of today's most emotional and important international crises. Fuller takes us from the birth of Islam to the fall of Rome to the rise and collapse of the Ottoman Empire. He examines and analyzes the roots of terrorism, the conflict in Israel, and the role of Islam in supporting and energizing the anti-imperial struggle. Provocatively, he finds that contrary to the claims of many politicians, thinkers, theologians, and soldiers, a world without Islam might not look vastly different from what we know today.Filled with fascinating details and counterintuitive conclusions, A WORLD WITHOUT ISLAM is certain to inspire debate and reshape the way we think about Islam's relationship with the West.",,,10/30/10,August 11th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'History', 'Politics', 'Theology', 'International Relations', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Political Science']",,9780316041195,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344266809l/7193774.jpg,3.98,[],100.0,1.0,,7193774-a-world-without-islam,,,,,93.0,1583.0,336,,"Little, Brown and Company","['534', '631', '314', '66', '38']",,,[],,

Graham Farmelo,"The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom",,English,,"'A monumental achievement - one of the great scientific biographies.' Michael FraynThe Strangest Man is the Costa Biography Award-winning account of Paul Dirac, the famous physicist sometimes called the British Einstein. He was one of the leading pioneers of the greatest revolution in twentieth-century science: quantum mechanics. The youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel Prize for Physics, he was also pathologically reticent, strangely literal-minded and legendarily unable to communicate or empathize. Through his greatest period of productivity, his postcards home contained only remarks about the weather.Based on a previously undiscovered archive of family papers, Graham Farmelo celebrates Dirac's massive scientific achievement while drawing a compassionate portrait of his life and work. Farmelo shows a man who, while hopelessly socially inept, could manage to love and sustain close friendship.The Strangest Man is an extraordinary and moving human story, as well as a study of one of the most exciting times in scientific history.'A wonderful book . . .

Feeling responsible for her unhappiness, Henry decides against his better judgment to accept a loan from a black marketeer to secure Louise’s passage.

Graham Hancock (Goodreads Author),Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind,,English,,"Less than 50,000 years ago humans had no art, no religion, no sophisticated symbolism, no innovative thinking. Then, in a dramatic change, described by scientists as 'the greatest riddle in human history', all the skills & qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as tho bestowed on us by hidden powers. In Supernatural Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious before-&-after moment & to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern mind. His quest takes him on a detective journey from the beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain & Italy to rock shelters in the mountains of S. Africa, where he finds extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to the Amazon rainforest to drink the hallucinogen Ayahuasca with shamans, whose paintings contain images of 'super-natural beings' identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves. Hallucinogens such as mescaline also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings.

"Graham Hancock (Goodreads Author), Santha Faiia (Photographer)",Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth's Lost Civilization,,English,,"Could the story of mankind be far older than we have previously believed? Using tools as varied as archaeo-astronomy, geology, and computer analysis of ancient myths, Graham Hancock presents a compelling case to suggest that it is.In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock embarks on a worldwide quest to put together all the pieces of the vast and fascinating jigsaw of mankind’s hidden past. In ancient monuments as far apart as Egypt’s Great Sphinx, the strange Andean ruins of Tihuanaco, and Mexico’s awe-inspiring Temples of the Sun and Moon, he reveals not only the clear fingerprints of an as-yet-unidentified civilization of remote antiquity, but also startling evidence of its vast sophistication, technological advancement, and evolved scientific knowledge. A record-breaking number one bestseller in Britain, Fingerprints of the Gods contains the makings of an intellectual revolution, a dramatic and irreversible change in the way that we understand our past—and so our future.And Fingerprints of the Gods tells us something more. As we recover the truth about prehistory, and discover the real meaning of ancient myths and monuments, it becomes apparent that a warning has been handed down to us, a warning of terrible cataclysm that afflicts the Earth in great cycles at irregular intervals of time—a cataclysm that may be about to recur.",上帝的指紋 #1,,10/28/95,April 2nd 1996,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Ancient History', 'Archaeology', 'Alternate History', 'Mythology', 'Anthropology', 'Spirituality', 'Historical']",,9780517887295,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403173617l/53325.jpg,4.18,[],369.0,4.0,,53325.Fingerprints_of_the_Gods,,,,,94.0,9143.0,578,,Three Rivers Press,"['4146', '3182', '1311', '351', '153']",,,[],,

Graham Moore (Goodreads Author),The Last Days of Night,,English,,"New York, 1888. Gas lamps still flicker in the city streets, but the miracle of electric light is in its infancy. The person who controls the means to turn night into day will make history--and a vast fortune. A young untested lawyer named Paul Cravath, fresh out of Columbia Law School, takes a case that seems impossible to win. Paul's client, George Westinghouse, has been sued by Thomas Edison over a billion-dollar question: Who invented the light bulb and holds the right to power the country? The case affords Paul entry to the heady world of high society--the glittering parties in Gramercy Park mansions, and the more insidious dealings done behind closed doors. The task facing him is beyond daunting. Edison is a wily, dangerous opponent with vast resources at his disposal--private spies, newspapers in his pocket, and the backing of J. P. Morgan himself. Yet this unknown lawyer shares with his famous adversary a compulsion to win at all costs. How will he do it?In obsessive pursuit of victory, Paul crosses paths with Nikola Tesla, an eccentric, brilliant inventor who may hold the key to defeating Edison, and with Agnes Huntington, a beautiful opera singer who proves to be a flawless performer on stage and off. As Paul takes greater and greater risks, he'll find that everyone in his path is playing their own game, and no one is quite who they seem.",,First Edition,,August 16th 2016,"['Thomas Edison', 'J.P.

Graham Parke (Goodreads Author),Unspent Time,,English,,"International Book Awards finalistWarning: reading this novel may make you more attractive and elevate your random luck by about 9.332%*(*These statements have not been evaluated by anyone of consequence.)From the award winning author of 'No Hope for Gomez!' comes a collection of 20 impossible tales set in the 'NoHope universe'. Permeating the cracks between the past and the present is the realm of Unspent Time. Pockets of 'should have been's and 'might have happened's. Time that was allotted but never spent. In this realm we find the stories that could have been true.Such as the story of Goki Feng Ho: the ancient Chinese art of decoding the meaning of car license plates. Or the tale of Matthew G., who skip-stones through life on the back of mysterious black-outs, blinking in and out of conscious existence at random. Or the story of little Kiala, whose aunt and caretaker disappears one day, leaving her as the sole Huntress to battle the giant octopi to feed her village. Or the heartbreaking story of the man responsible for choosing the colors of the insides of your shoes. As he toils away in obscurity, his work impacts society in ways we'll never fully comprehend. Or even care about. And let's not forget the story behind Unspent Time itself, the metaphysical ramifications of which will leave the scientific community feeling, well, mostly indifferent about it...What people are saying about the 'NoHope universe' books:""Extremely witty and clever writing that contains keen insights into human nature."" --California Chronicle""The antics in these books will leave the reader laughing.

Graham Robb,Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris,,,,"The secrets of the City of Light, revealed in the lives of the great, the near-great, and the forgotten—by the author of the acclaimed The Discovery of France. This is the Paris you never knew. From the Revolution to the present, Graham Robb has distilled a series of astonishing true narratives, all stranger than fiction.  A young artillery lieutenant, strolling through the Palais-Royal, observes disapprovingly the courtesans plying their trade. A particular woman catches his eye; nature takes its course. Later that night Napoleon Bonaparte writes a meticulous account of his first sexual encounter. An aristocratic woman, fleeing the Louvre, takes a wrong turn and loses her way in the nameless streets of the Left Bank. For want of a map—there were no reliable ones at the time—Marie-Antoinette will go to the guillotine. Baudelaire, Baron Haussmann, the real-life Mimi of La Bohème, Proust, Charles de Gaulle (who is suspected of having faked an assassination attempt on himself in Notre Dame) —these and many more are Robb’s cast of characters.

For almost all of those years she has been the clandestine lover to Paul Sheringham, young heir of a neighboring house. The two now meet on an unseasonably warm March day—Mothering Sunday—a day that will change Jane's life forever.

Grant Hardy,Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader's Guide,,English,,"Mark Twain once derided the Book of Mormon as ""chloroform in print."" Long and complicated, written in the language of the King James version of the Bible, it boggles the minds of many. Yet it is unquestionably one of the most influential books ever written. With over 140 million copies in print, it is a central text of one of the largest and fastest-growing faiths in the world. And, Grant Hardy shows, it's far from the coma-inducing doorstop caricatured by Twain.In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy offers the first comprehensive analysis of the work's narrative structure in its 180 year history. Unlike virtually all other recent world scriptures, the Book of Mormon presents itself as an integrated narrative rather than a series of doctrinal expositions, moral injunctions, or devotional hymns. Hardy takes readers through its characters, events, and ideas, as he explores the story and its messages. He identifies the book's literary techniques, such as characterization, embedded documents, allusions, and parallel narratives. Whether Joseph Smith is regarded as author or translator, it's noteworthy that he never speaks in his own voice; rather, he mediates nearly everything through the narrators Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni. Hardy shows how each has a distinctive voice, and all are woven into an integral whole.As with any scripture, the contending views of the Book of Mormon can seem irreconcilable. For believers, it is an actual historical document, transmitted from ancient America. For nonbelievers, it is the work of a nineteenth-century farmer from upstate New York. Hardy transcends this intractable conflict by offering a literary approach, one appropriate to both history and fiction. Regardless of whether readers are interested in American history, literature, comparative religion, or even salvation, he writes, the book can best be read if we examine the text on its own terms.",,,06/06/03,April 7th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Lds', 'Mormonism', 'Theology', 'Church', 'Spirituality', 'Lds Non Fiction', 'Inspirational', 'Christianity']",,9780199731701,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347601908l/7571146.jpg,4.42,[],81.0,1.0,,7571146-understanding-the-book-of-mormon,,,,,97.0,467.0,368,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['274', '133', '47', '7', '6']",,,[],,
Grant Hardy,Great Minds of the Eastern Intellectual Tradition,,English,,"Western philosophy is a vast intellectual tradition, the product of thousands of years of revolutionary thought built up by a rich collection of brilliant minds. But to understand the Western intellectual tradition is to get only half the story. The Eastern intellectual tradition has made just as important a contribution - and is also the product of thousands of years of cumulative thought by a distinct group of brilliant thinkers.Their ideas demonstrate wholly different ways of approaching and solving the same fundamental issues that concerned the West's greatest thinkers, such as the existence of God, the meaning of life and the nature of truth and reality.This epic and comprehensive 36-lecture examination of the East's most influential philosophers and thinkers - from a much-honored teacher and scholar - offers a thought-provoking look at the surprising connections and differences between East and West. By introducing you to the people-including The Buddha, Ashoka, Prince Shotoku, Confucius, and Gandhi - responsible for molding Asian philosophy and for giving birth to a wide variety of spiritual and ideological systems, it will strengthen your knowledge of cultures that play increasingly important roles in our globalized 21st-century world.",,,11/06/11,July 8th 2013,[],Audible Audio,"['Philosophy', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'India', 'China', 'Asia', 'Taoism', 'Buddhism']",,9781598037418,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393798503l/20948114.jpg,4.43,[],85.0,1.0,,20948114-great-minds-of-the-eastern-intellectual-tradition,,,,,99.0,210.0,19,,The Great Courses,"['111', '82', '14', '2', '1']",,,[],,

Now these changed children have reached adolescence . . . and face a world that is outraged about their very existence. For these special youths, possessed of remarkable, advanced traits that mark a major turning point in human development, are also ticking time bombs harboring hosts of viruses that could exterminate the “old” human race.Fear and hatred of the virus children have made them a persecuted underclass, quarantined by the government in special “schools,” targeted by federally sanctioned bounty hunters, and demonized by hysterical segments of the population. But pockets of resistance have sprung up among those opposed to treating the children like dangerous diseases—and who fear the worst if the government’s draconian measures are carried to their extreme.Scientists Kaye Lang and Mitch Rafelson are part of this small but determined minority. Once at the forefront of the discovery and study of the SHEVA outbreak, they now live as virtual exiles in the Virginia suburbs with their daughter, Stella—a bright, inquisitive virus child who is quickly maturing, straining to break free of the protective world her parents have built around her, and eager to seek out others of her kind.But for all their precautions, Kaye, Mitch, and Stella have not slipped below the government’s radar.

On September 28th, Edward Shaw finds an error in the geological records of Death Valley. A cinder cone was left off the map. Could it be new? Or, stranger yet, could it be artificial? The answer may be lying beside it—a dying Guest who brings devastating news for Edward and for Planet Earth.As more unexplained phenomena spring up around the globe—a granite mountain appearing in Australia, sounds emanating from the Earth’s core, flashes of light amongst the asteroids—it becomes clear to some that the end is approaching, and there is nothing we can do.In THE FORGE OF GOD, award-winning author Greg Bear describes the final days of the world on both a massive, scientific scale and in the everyday, emotional context of individual human lives. Facing the destruction of all they know, some people turn to God, others to their families, and a few turn to saviors promising escape from a planet tearing apart.Will they make it in time?

Greg Bear,Moving Mars,,English,,"
  
    Moving Mars is a story of human courage and love set within the greater saga of a planetary liberation movement. Mars is a colonial world, governed by corporate interests on Earth. The citizens of Mars are hardworking, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of the Earthly powers to keep the best new inventions for themselves. The young Martians -- the second and third generations born on Mars -- have little loyalty to Earth, and a strong belief that their planet can be independent. The revolution begins slowly, but will grow in power over decades of political struggle until it becomes irresistible.
     
    Told through the eyes of an extraordinary character, Casseia Majumdar, a daughter of one of Mars' oldest, most conservative Binding Multiples, Moving Mars is Greg Bear's brilliant conception of the human colonization of the red planet, with lovingly painted details and a grand historical sweep, embellishing an audacious scientific speculation.

It’s the best relationship advice you’ll ever receive. For ages, women have come together over coffee, cocktails, or late-night phone chats to analyze the puzzling behavior of men.

Unfortunately, guys are too terrified to ever directly tell a woman, “You're not the one.” But their actions absolutely show how they feel. Reexamining familiar scenarios and classic mindsets that keep us in unsatisfying relationships, Behrendt and Tuccillo’s wise and wry understanding of the sexes spares women hours of waiting by the phone, obsessing over the details with sympathetic girlfriends, and hoping his mixed messages really mean, “I’m in love with you and want to be with you.” He’s Just Not That Into You is provocative, hilarious, and, above all, intoxicatingly liberating.

The heartbreaking but seemingly straightforward death of his father's African-American nurse, Viola Turner, has fractured Penn's family and turned Dr. Tom Cage into a fugitive from justice. And in the search for his father and his reasons for running, Penn has unwittingly started a war with a violent offshoot of the KKK, the Double Eagles, whose members seem to know much more about Tom's past than Penn or his mother ever did.Desperately following his father's trail, Penn finds himself in a maze of mirrors, beset on all sides by a family of criminals and corrupt police whose power reaches into the highest levels of state government. To even the odds, Penn must rely on allies whose objectives are very different from his own. FBI special agent John Kaiser sees Tom Cage as the key to closing not only countless civil rights murders, but also the ultimate cold case: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Penn's fiancée, journalist Caitlin Masters, is chasing the biggest story of her career and believes Tom can lead her to evidence of America's most secret, shameful history. In the end, all roads will lead to the mysterious Bone Tree, a legendary killing site that may conceal far more than the remains of the forgotten.Penn now knows that the death of Viola Turner is a door to the darkest chapters of America's past. In the civil rights battleground that was 1960s Mississippi and Louisiana, powerful men had audacious, sweeping agendas, and their violent race murders concealed a conspiracy that ran wide and deep, involving the New Orleans Mafia, a Double Eagle hit squad, and a world- altering murder in Dealey Plaza in 1963.

The Devil's Punchbowl reveals a world of depravity, sex, violence, and the corruption of a Southern town. As a prosecuting attorney in Houston, Penn Cage sent hardened killers to death row. But it is as mayor of his hometown -- Natchez, Mississippi -- that Penn will face his most dangerous threat. Urged by old friends to try to restore this fading jewel of the Old South, Penn has ridden into office on a tide of support for change. But in its quest for new jobs and fresh money, Natchez, like other Mississippi towns, has turned to casino gambling, and now five fantastical steamboats float on the river beside the old slave market at Natchez like props from Gone With the Wind.But one boat isn't like the others.Rumor has it that the Magnolia Queen has found a way to pull the big players from Las Vegas to its Mississippi backwater. And with them -- on sleek private jets that slip in and out of town like whispers in the night -- come pro football players, rap stars, and international gamblers, all sharing an unquenchable taste for one thing: blood sport -- and the dark vices that go with it. When a childhood friend of Penn's who brings him evidence of these crimes is brutally murdered, the full weight of Penn's failure to protect his city hits home. So begins his quest to find the men responsible. But it's a hunt he begins alone, for the local authorities have been corrupted by the money and power of his hidden enemy. With his family's lives at stake, Penn realizes his only allies in his one-man war are those bound to him by blood or honor: Caitlin Masters, the lover Penn found in The Quiet Can Game and lost in Turning Angel Danny McDavitt, the heroic helicopter pilot from  Tom Cage, Penn's father and legendary local family physician Walt Garrity, a retired Texas Ranger who served with Penn's father during the Korean War.Together they must defeat a sophisticated killer who has an almost preternatural ability to anticipate -- and counter -- their every move. Ultimately, victory will depend on a bold stroke that will leave one of Penn's allies dead -- and Natchez changed forever.After appearing in two of Iles's most popular novels, Penn Cage makes his triumphant return as a brilliant, honorable, and courageous hero.

The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations--preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son.During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others. Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner. It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son--Penn's half-brother--who sets in motion the murder case against his father. The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave.Tom Cage's murder trial sets a terrible clock in motion, and unless Penn can pierce the veil of the past and exonerate his father, his family will be destroyed. Unable to trust anyone around him--not even his own mother--Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity--a former soldier--battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble: their lives.Mississippi Blood is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making--one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, New York Times bestselling author Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited.",Penn Cage #6,,,March 21st 2017,[],Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Crime', 'Southern', 'Legal Thriller', 'Audiobook']",,B01HXJREHW,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474482950l/31139037._SY475_.jpg,4.43,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2017)'],192.0,2.0,,31139037-mississippi-blood,,,,,98.0,18254.0,704,,William Morrow,"['10376', '5844', '1612', '308', '114']",,,"['Natchez, Mississippi (United States)']",,

"Greg Sestero, Tom Bissell","The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made",,English,,"From the actor who lived through the most improbable Hollywood success story, with an award-winning narrative nonfiction writer, comes the inspiring, fascinating and laugh-out-loud story of a mysteriously wealthy outsider who sundered every road block in the Hollywood system to achieve success on his own terms—the making of The Room, “the Citizen Kane of bad movies” (Entertainment Weekly).In 2003, an independent film called The Room—written, produced, directed, and starring a very rich social misfit of indeterminate age and origin named Tommy Wiseau—made its disastrous debut in Los Angeles. Described by one reviewer as “like getting stabbed in the head,” the $6 million film earned a grand total of $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Now in its tenth anniversary year, The Room is an international phenomenon to rival The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Thousands of fans wait in line for hours to attend screenings complete with costumes, audience rituals, merchandising, and thousands of plastic spoons.Readers need not have seen The Room to appreciate its costar Greg Sestero’s account of how Tommy Wiseau defied every law of artistry, business, and interpersonal relationships to achieve the dream only he could love.

Greg Smith,Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story,,English,,"An insightful and devastating account of how Wall Street lost its way from an insider who experienced the culture of Goldman Sachs first-hand. On March 14, 2012, more than three million people read Greg Smith's bombshell Op-Ed in the New York Times titled ""Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs."" The column immediately went viral, became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, and drew passionate responses from former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous ""take-the-money-and-run"" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off. His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars. From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank. Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a ""vampire squid"" that referred to its clients as ""muppets"" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large. After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly. He walked away from his career and took matters into his own hands.

Gregory Boyle,Tattoos on the Heart: The Power of Boundless Compassion,,English,,"Father Gregory Boyle’s sparkling parables about kinship and the sacredness of life are drawn from twenty years working with gangs in LA.How do you fight despair and learn to meet the world with a loving heart? How do you overcome shame? Stay faithful in spite of failure? No matter where people live or what their circumstances may be, everyone needs boundless, restorative love. Gorgeous and uplifting, Tattoos on the Heart amply demonstrates the impact unconditional love can have on your life. As a pastor working in a neighborhood with the highest concentration of murderous gang activity in Los Angeles, Gregory Boyle created an organization to provide jobs, job training, and encouragement so that young people could work together and learn the mutual respect that comes from collaboration. Tattoos on the Heart is a breathtaking series of parables distilled from his twenty years in the barrio. Arranged by theme and filled with sparkling humor and glowing generosity, these essays offer a stirring look at how full our lives could be if we could find the joy in loving others and in being loved unconditionally. From giant, tattooed Cesar, shopping at JCPenney fresh out of prison, we learn how to feel worthy of God’s love. From ten-year-old Lula we learn the importance of being known and acknowledged. From Pedro we understand the kind of patience necessary to rescue someone from the darkness. In each chapter we benefit from Boyle’s wonderful, hard-earned wisdom. Inspired by faith but applicable to anyone trying to be good, these personal, unflinching stories are full of surprising revelations and observations of the community in which Boyle works and of the many lives he has helped save. Erudite, down-to-earth, and utterly heartening, these essays about universal kinship and redemption are moving examples of the power of unconditional love in difficult times and the importance of fighting despair. With Gregory Boyle’s guidance, we can recognize our own wounds in the broken lives and daunting struggles of the men and women in these parables and learn to find joy in all of the people around us.

Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas – this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart.

A story of revenge and redemption; the tale of the Scorpion.Thanks to the killer’s handiwork, Tony’s partners were also dead in Manhattan. The killer needed to finish his business in Westhampton tonight, so he could make his flight to Italy before any of the bodies were discovered. From his neck down he dressed like a surgeon with cotton coverings over his clothes and shoes that were specially made to fit although they were two sizes too large. He also wore latex gloves and a ski-mask to ensure that his entire body was protected against leaving even a cell of his DNA behind. Looking into the eyes of his victims in their final moment of life did not faze him. In fact, it gave him pleasure. The sound of Tony’s head smashing into the door disturbed him only because the success or failure of an assignment might hinge upon an unknown factor – variables that were his job to minimize. He never left anything to chance, carefully tending to the crime scene, making sure there was no evidence to assist law enforcement. Satisfied all was in order, he silently exited the master bedroom, gun in hand. Amanda tried the light switch in the kitchen, but it didn’t work. She opened the refrigerator door, found a pitcher of water, and poured a tall glass for her and Catarina to share. She replaced the pitcher, closed the refrigerator, took a step into the hallway and immediately noticed a large shadow of a person, obviously much taller than Tony. She shrieked in surprise and dropped the glass, which shattered. The killer reacted without conscious thought. He instinctively raised his gun and fired. Amanda made a loud moaning sound as she crumpled to the floor. Suddenly there was another scream behind him. He turned and aimed at the sound, not realizing that his gun was pointed at a forty-five degree angle toward the floor. He fired again and there was silence. It took only a split second for him to realize that the voice had screamed “Mommy.” Bred to kill, he is the perfect weapon. A soulless assassin until a fatal mistake.

Gregory Howard Williams,Life on the Color Line: The True Story of a White Boy Who Discovered He Was Black,,English,,"Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize   ""A triumph of storytelling as well as a triumph of spirit.""--Alex Kotlowitz, award-winning author of There Are No Children Here
  
 As a child in 1950s segregated Virginia, Gregory Howard Williams grew up believing he was white. But when the family business failed and his parents' marriage fell apart, Williams discovered that his dark-skinned father, who had been passing as Italian-American, was half black. The family split up, and Greg, his younger brother, and their father moved to Muncie, Indiana, where the young boys learned the truth about their heritage. Overnight, Greg Williams became black.In this extraordinary and powerful memoir, Williams recounts his remarkable journey along the color line and illuminates the contrasts between the black and white worlds: one of privilege, opportunity and comfort, the other of deprivation, repression, and struggle. He tells of the hostility and prejudice he encountered all too often, from both blacks and whites, and the surprising moments of encouragement and acceptance he found from each.Life on the Color Line is a uniquely important book. It is a wonderfully inspiring testament of purpose, perseverance, and human triumph.""Heartbreaking and uplifting... a searing book about race and prejudice in America... brims with insights that only someone who has lived on both sides of the racial divide could gain.""--

Gregory Wilbur,Glory and Honor: The Music and Artistic Legacy of Johann Sebastian Bach,,English,,"Johann Sebastian Bach was a musical genius, an intellectual giant, and a gracious man. His achievement in the area of music is one of the greatest tours de force in history-on a par with or surpassing that of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Dante, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Milton, Aristotle, Augustine, or Aquinas. Even more compelling is the fact that Bach intentionally wrote all of his music from a Christian perspective and for the glory of God. Bach worked at a crucial time in history. He combated the ideas of the Enlightenment with its elevation of human reason as the ultimate authority of everything. His struggles, musically and professionally, are those of a man seeking to maintain a high view of worship, academics, and the grounding of all life on the Word of God. As a man valiant in his convictions, he stood against the trends and fashions of his day and succeeded as a witness of the gospel to the generations who followed him. Although orphaned at an early age, Bach grew up surrounded by a life of music and quickly distinguished himself as an avid learner and apt pupil. The majority of his career was as the cantor of Leipzig-a position that required him to teach school and provide music for the town's churches every week. During this period he wrote a tremendous amount of music and fought against Enlightenment ideas that sought to undermine church worship. And while his name conjures many images, musical phrases, and half-remembered stories, the life of this colossal genius provides practical lessons in leadership for both artists and anyone who strives to serve others with excellence and integrity.",Leaders in Action,,,November 1st 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Music']",,9781581824704,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388454655l/1387399.jpg,4.03,[],52.0,1.0,,1387399.Glory_and_Honor,,,,,97.0,35.0,260,,Cumberland House Publishing,"['13', '11', '10', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Grif Stockley,Daisy Bates,Civil Rights Crusader from Arkansas,,Biography & Autobiography,"Daisy Bates (1914-1999) is renowned as the mentor of the Little Rock Nine, the first African Americans to attend Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. For guiding the Nine through one of the most tumultuous civil rights crises of the 1950s, she was selected as Woman of the Year in Education by the Associated Press in 1957 and was the only woman invited to speak at the Lincoln Memorial ceremony in the March on Washington in 1963. But her importance as a historical figure has been overlooked by scholars of the civil rights movement. Daisy Bates: Civil Rights Crusader from Arkansas chronicles her life and political advocacy before, during, and well after the Central High School crisis. An orphan from the Arkansas mill town of Huttig, she eventually rose to the zenith of civil rights action. In 1952, she was elected president of the NAACP in Arkansas and traveled the country speaking on political issues. During the 1960s, she worked as a field organizer for presidents John F.

Grégoire Delacourt,The List of My Desires,,English,,"Jocelyne is 47 and runs her own dressmaking shop. She's a bit overweight, her husband is very ordinary and her best friends are the twins who run the hairdresser next door. Jocelyn has reached the point where she is examining her life and measuring it against what her teenage self had imagined. Jocelyn's mother dropped dead suddenly when she was 17, and her father fell ill shortly afterwards, so she had to take the job in the shop rather than pursue her dreams. But then is she really unhappy? She has her weekends away, her friendships, her sewing blog, her work and its small pleasures. . .Then the twins persuade Jocelyn to enter the euromillion lottery and she wins 18 million euros. She could do anything with the money, change her life completely, but what does she really want? She doesn't tell anyone about the win. . . not just yet. . . Without cashing the cheque she begins to write down her 'list of desires' - a new coat, a bathmat, a visit to her daughter in England.

Guadalupe Nettel,Después del invierno,,Spanish,,"Claudio es cubano, vive en Nueva York y trabaja en una editorial. Cecilia es mexicana, vive en París y es estudiante. En el pasado de él hay recuerdos de La Habana y el dolor por la pérdida de su primera novia, y en su presente, la complicada relación con Ruth. En el pasado de ella hay una adolescencia difícil, y en su presente, la relación con Tom, un chico de salud delicada con quien comparte su afición por los cementerios. Será durante un viaje de Claudio a París cuando sus destinos se entrecrucen. Mientras Claudio y Cecilia describen con minuciosidad su día a día en París y Nueva York, ambos dejan traslucir sus neurosis, sus pasiones, sus fobias y las reminiscencias del pasado que dictan sus miedos, dando cuenta de cómo se conocieron y de las circunstancias que los llevaron a gustarse, a quererse y a detestarse de manera intermitente. Después del invierno muestra con un estilo incisivo, a veces humorístico y a veces conmovedor, los mecanismos de las relaciones amorosas, así como sus diversos ingredientes. Con una banda sonora de fondo en la que suenan Nick Drake, Kind of Blue de Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett o Las horas de Philip Glass, la historia de amor entre Claudio y Cecilia forma parte de un relato mayor que abarca un periodo importante de sus existencias. Cada uno sigue su periplo trazando un mapa hecho de encuentros y ausencias, de búsquedas e incertidumbres, de anhelos y pesares; cada uno, obligado por sus circunstancias, desciende al abismo de sus derrotas anímicas en busca de las claves para relacionarse tanto con los otros como consigo mismo, y para construir, si es posible, su propio oasis de felicidad.Guadalupe Nettel ha escrito una novela rotunda, de una ambición e intensidad poco usuales, que ahonda con maestría en su reconocible universo, el de los seres que habitan los márgenes, el extrañamiento, la anomalía.

Au terme d’un divorce orageux, chacun obtient la garde d’un des enfants : Sebastian éduque sa fille avec une grande rigueur alors que Nikki pardonne facilement à son fils ses écarts de conduite. Les années passent. Chacun a refait sa vie, très loin de l’autre. Jusqu’au jour où Jeremy disparaît mystérieusement. Fugue ? Kidnapping ? Pour sauver ce qu’elle a de plus cher, Nikki n’a d’autre choix que de se tourner vers son ex-mari qu’elle n’a pas revu depuis sept ans. Contraints d’unir leurs forces, Nikki et Sebastian s’engagent alors dans une course-poursuite, retrouvant une intimité qu’ils croyaient perdue à jamais.

Guillermo Arriaga,Salvar el fuego,,Spanish,,"
  PREMIO ALFAGUARA DE NOVELA 2020
 
  Una historia de violencia en el México contemporáneo donde el amor y la redención aún son posibles.
 Marina, una mujer casada, con tres hijos y una vida familiar resuelta, coreógrafa de cierto prestigio, se ve involucrada en un amorío improbable con un hombre impensable. Salvar el fuego retrata dos Méxicos completamente escindidos uno del otro, donde Marina, que pertenece a la clase social más alta, se vincula con un hombre al extremo de la sociedad. Esta es una novela que retrata las contradicciones de un país y las contradicciones más hondas de la naturaleza humana. Es una novela de amor y es una novela que al final termina por brindar esperanza. «Una novela polifónica que narra con intensidad y con excepcional dinamismo una historia de violencia en el México contemporáneo donde el amor y la redención aún son posibles. El autor se sirve tantode una extraordinaria fuerza visual como de la recreación y reinvención del lenguaje coloquial para lograr una obra de inquietante verosimilitud. Los distintos planos narrativos tienen como hilo conductor el cuerpo humano, motivo de celebración y expuesto a numerosos excesos.»Del acta del jurado La crítica ha dicho:«El mexicano Guillermo Arriaga no es solo un escritor de la gran pantalla sino un narrador de raza, cuyas obsesiones vitales dejan honda huella en el lector.»Matías Néspolo, El Mundo «Un autor absolutamente único.»Guadalupe Nettel «Uno de los autores contemporáneos más potentes, intensos y originales de la literatura en idioma español.»El Exprés (México) «Arriaga demuestra ser gran director a la par que gran escritor.»Roberto Piorno, Guía del Ocio «Con sensibilidad extrema y poderío visual, enlazando con coherencia personajes y situaciones que inicialmente parecen no guardar relación [...], Arriaga demuestra que, además de un espléndido guionista, también es un buen director.»Carlos Boyero, El País «El Salvaje es uno de los mejores libros que he leído, no solo en este sino en los últimos años.»Santiago Gamboa «La presencia ominosa de la muerte; el amor o la pasión que todo lo crea y, por encima, la fuerza irrefrenable de la vida que arrastra todo consigo en su prepotencia arrolladora. Esos son los motivos que entrelaza con sabiduría en El Salvaje, una ambiciosa y lograda novela.»Matías Néspolo, El Mundo «Sublime Arriaga. El Salvaje consagra a su autor como el mejor escritor mexicano actual y como una figura indiscutible de las letras universales.

Humiliations, filth, stench, and physical abuse comprise the asphyxiating atmosphere of a halfway house for indigents in Miami where, in a shaken mental state, the writer William Figueras lives after his exile from Cuba. He claims to have gone crazy after the Cuban government judged his first novel “morose, pornographic, and also irreverent, because it dealt harshly with the Communist Party,” and prohibited its publication. By the time he arrives in Miami twenty years later, he is a “toothless, skinny, frightened guy who had to be admitted to a psychiatric ward that very day” instead of the ready-for-success exile his relatives expected to welcome and receive among them. Placed in a halfway house, with its trapped bestial inhabitants and abusive overseers, he enters a hell. Romance appears in the form of Frances, a mentally fragile woman and an angel, with whom he tries to escape in this apocalyptic classic of Cuban literature.“Behind the hardly one hundred pages,” Canarias Diario stated, “is the work of a tireless fabulist, a writer who delights in language, extracting verbs and adjectives which are powerful enough to stop the reader in his tracks.”",,,11/06/87,May 27th 2009,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Latin American', '20th Century', 'Roman', 'Literature']",,9780811218023,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779656l/6139012.jpg,3.89,[],93.0,1.0,,6139012-the-halfway-house,,,,,93.0,961.0,144,,New Directions,"['262', '401', '233', '58', '7']",,,[],,

Gurcharan Das,India Unbound: The Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age,,English,,"India today is a vibrant free-market democracy, a nation well on its way to overcoming decades of widespread poverty. The nation's rise is one of the great international stories of the late twentieth century, and in India Unbound the acclaimed columnist Gurcharan Das offers a sweeping economic history of India from independence to the new millennium.Das shows how India's policies after 1947 condemned the nation to a hobbled economy until 1991, when the government instituted sweeping reforms that paved the way for extraordinary growth. Das traces these developments and tells the stories of the major players from Nehru through today. As the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble India, Das offers a unique insider's perspective and he deftly interweaves memoir with history, creating a book that is at once vigorously analytical and vividly written.

Gurcharan Das,The Difficulty of Being Good: On the Subtle Art of Dharma,,English,,"In his new book, Gurcharan Das turns to the Mahabharata in order to answer the question, ""why be good'', and discovers that the epic's world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate in this fundamentalist age of moral certainty. The Mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma - in essence, doing the right thing. When a hero falters, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and often contradictory take on dharma. The epic's characters are flawed, but their incoherent experiences throw light on our familiar dilemmas. Gurcharan Das's best-selling book India Unbound examined the classical aim of artha, material well being. This, his first book in seven years, dwells on the goal of dharma, moral well being. It addresses the central problem of how to live our lives in an examined way - holding a mirror up to us and forcing us to confront the many ways in which we deceive ourselves and others. What emerges is a doctrine of dharma that we can apply to our business decisions, political strategies and interpersonal relationships - in effect, to life itself.",,Royal,11/06/09,August 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'India', 'Mythology', 'History', 'Spirituality', 'Indian Literature', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'Hinduism']",,9780670083497,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348009106l/6971900.jpg,4.1,[],93.0,1.0,,6971900-the-difficulty-of-being-good,,,,,96.0,3913.0,488,,Penguin Books India,"['1423', '1676', '645', '117', '52']",,,[],,

Guy Gavriel Kay (Goodreads Author),The Fionavar Tapestry,,English,,"In the three novels that make up the Fionavar Tapestry trilogy collected in this omnibus edition (The Summer Tree, The Wandering Fire, and The Darkest Road), five University of Toronto students find themselves transported to a magical land to do battle with the forces of evil. At a Celtic conference, Kimberley, Kevin, Jennifer, Dave, and Paul meet wizard Loren Silvercloak. Returning with him to the magical kingdom of Fionavar to attend a festival, they soon discover that they are being drawn into the conflict between the dark and the light as Unraveller Rakoth Maugrim breaks free of his mountain prison and threatens the continued existence of Fionavar. They join mages, elves, dwarves, and the forces of the High King of Brennin to do battle with Maugrim, where Kay's imaginative powers as a world-builder come to the fore. He stunningly weaves Arthurian legends into the fluid mix of Celtic, Nordic, and Teutonic, creating a grand fantasy that sweeps readers into a heroic struggle that the author makes all the more memorable because of the tributes he pays to past masters.  The trilogy is a grand homage to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but while the echoes of Tolkien's masterwork are very real, the books offer the wonderful taste of a new fantasy writer cutting his teeth at the foot of a master. Kay has a very real connection to Tolkien--as Christopher Tolkien's assistant, Kay was invaluable in helping to wrestle Tolkien's posthumous The Silmarillion into shape for publication. Kay is undoubtedly one of the Canadian masters of high fantasy, and The Fionavar Tapestry is one of his most enduring works. Readers, however, should also check out Kay's Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, The Lions of Al-Rassan, and The Sarantine Mosaic to truly experience a master at work. --Jeffrey Canton ",The Fionavar Tapestry #1-3,First Thus edition,10/28/86,1995,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Canada', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Arthurian', 'Mythology', 'Adult', 'Adventure']",,9780006479505,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181410214l/1148721._SY475_.jpg,4.21,['Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee (1987)'],933.0,11.0,,1148721.The_Fionavar_Tapestry,,,,,94.0,6787.0,792,,HarperCollins Publishers Canada,"['3378', '2032', '967', '272', '138']",,,[],,

Shen Tai, son of an illustrious general serving the Emperor of Kitai, has spent two years honoring the memory of his late father by burying the bones of the dead from both armies at the site of one of his father's last great battles. In recognition of his labors and his filial piety, an unlikely source has sent him a dangerous gift: 250 Sardian horses.  You give a man one of the famed Sardian horses to reward him greatly. You give him four or five to exalt him above his fellows, propel him towards rank, and earn him jealousy, possibly mortal jealousy.

Guy Johnson,Standing at the Scratch Line,,English,,"Raised in the steamy bayous of New Orleans in the early 1900s, LeRoi ""King"" Tremain, caught up in his family's ongoing feud with the rival DuMont family, learns to fight. But when the teenage King mistakenly kills two white deputies during a botched raid on the DuMonts, the Tremains' fear of reprisal forces King to flee Louisiana. King thus embarks on an adventure that first takes him to France, where he fights in World War I as a member of the segregated 369th Battalion—in the bigoted army he finds himself locked in combat with American soldiers as well as with Germans. When he returns to America, he battles the Mob in Jazz Age Harlem, the KKK in Louisiana, and crooked politicians trying to destroy a black township in Oklahoma. King Tremain is driven by two principal forces: He wants to be treated with respect, and he wants to create a family dynasty much like the one he left behind in Louisiana.

Guy Kawasaki (Goodreads Author),"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions",,English,,"Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas.A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.??A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.??A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers.This book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise ""wisdom of the crowd.""Kawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.As Kawasaki writes, ""Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do."" That's a big goal, but one that's possible for all of us.",,,01/01/11,March 8th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Personal Development', 'Management', 'Communication', 'Buisness']",,9781591843795,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311705632l/9895917.jpg,3.76,[],93.0,1.0,,9895917-enchantment,,,,,87.0,10009.0,240,,Portfolio,"['3059', '3147', '2550', '873', '380']",,,[],,
Guy L. Beck,Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound (Studies in Comparative Religion),,,,"Traditionally Hinduism has appealed to Western eyes though its rich tableau of visual artifacts: temple architecture, sculpture, painting, craft. Guy Beck argues, however, that the focus of Western scholars on Hinduism's visual component has often been at the expense of the religion's most important feature - its emphasis on sound. Beck addresses this longstanding imbalance in this pathbreaking study. He contends that sound possesses a central place in Hindu theory and practice and that Hinduism is essentially a sonic theology. Unlike religious traditions that emphasize silence, the Hindu world is permeated by sound. Drums, bells, gongs, cymbals, conches, flutes, and an array of vocalizations play a central role in the worship experience. Beck provides a theoretical exposition of the major textual sources of Hindu sacred sound, namely the Vedas, Upanishads, Mimamsa, Grammar, Yoga, Saiva-Agama, Sakta-Tantra, and Vaisnava Pancaratra. From the Vedic Vak as ""spoken word"" to the Sabda-Brahman of the Upanishads, Mimamsa, and Grammar, and on to the Nada-Brahman of Yoga, Saivism, Saktism, Vaisnavism, and Indian classical music, Beck argues that sound participates at every level of the Hindu cosmos. As he weaves the theology of sound throughout Hindu textual traditions, Beck provides ample, coherent justifications of the practical use of sound in Mantra repetitions, Om recitations, and Nada-Brahman meditational techniques. He compares the centrality of sound in Hindu theology to its role, or its absence, in other religions. The issues Beck raises about sound and language not only reshape our understanding of Hindu worship but also invite a fresh approach to comparative theology.",,,,April 1st 1993,[],Hardcover,['Music'],,9780872498556,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1267980744l/3399321.jpg,4.0,[],93.0,1.0,,3399321-sonic-theology,,,,,83.0,6.0,306,,Univ of South Carolina Pr,"['3', '2', '0', '0', '1']",,,[],,

Guy P. Harrison,50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God,,,,"For skeptics looking for appealing ways to approach their believing friends or believers who are not afraid to consider a skeptical challenge, this book makes for very stimulating reading. Many books that challenge religious belief from a skeptical point of view take a combative tone that is almost guaranteed to alienate believers or they present complex philosophical or scientific arguments that fail to reach the average reader.This is undoubtably an ineffective way of encouraging people to develop critical thinking about religion. This is a unique approach to skepticism regarding that presents fifty commonly heard reasons people often give for believing in a God and then he raises legitimate questions regarding these reasons, showing in each case that there is much room for doubt.Whether you're a believer, a complete skeptic, or somewhere in between, you'll find this review of traditional and more recent arguments for the existence of God refreshing, approachable, and enlightening. From religion as the foundation of morality to the authority of sacred books, the compelling religious testimony of influential people, near-death experiences, arguments from Intelligent Design, and much more, Harrison respectfully describes each rationale for belief and then politely shows the deficiencies that any good skeptic would point out. As a journalist who has traveled widely and interviewed many highly accomplished people, quite a number of whom are believers, the author appreciates the variety of belief and the ways in which people seek to make religion compatible with scientific thought. Nonetheless, he shows that, despite the prevalence of belief in gods or religious belief in intelligent people, in the end there are no unassailable reasons for believing in a god.",,,06/05/08,,[],Kindle Edition,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Atheism', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Spirituality', 'Skepticism', 'Psychology', 'God', 'Essays']",,9781591025672,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328336216l/6652033.jpg,3.96,[],71.0,1.0,,6652033-50-reasons-people-give-for-believing-in-a-god,,,,,91.0,1851.0,354,,,"['699', '605', '378', '110', '59']",,,[],,

Young, attractive and very ambitious, George Duroy, known to his admirers as Bel-Ami, is offered a job as a journalist on La Vie francaise and soon makes a great success of his new career. But he also comes face to face with the realities of the corrupt society in which he lives - the sleazy colleagues, the manipulative mistresses, and wily financiers - and swiftly learns to become an arch-seducer, blackmailer and social climber in a world where love is only a means to an end. Written when Maupassant was at the height of his powers, ""Bel-Ami"" is a novel of great frankness and cynicism, but it is also infused with the sheer joy of life - depicting the scenes and characters of Paris in the belle epoque with wit, sensitivity, and humanity. Douglas Parmee's translation captures all the vigour and vitality of Maupassant's novel.

These were the people who went up to the hills and came back staggering under the weight of the treasure they carried, and who began transforming San Francisco from a shantytown into one of the most brilliant cities in the world. This novel tells the unforgettable story of how these people walked into one of the most spectacular adventures in the world’s history. They saw the first samples of gold brought to the quartermaster, who said they were flakes of yellow mica. They were there when the first people who saw the gold were laughed at and called “crackbrains.” And they laid the foundation of the golden empire before the first forty-niners got there. Some of them could not meet the demands of this strange new world; others grew stronger and shared the greatness of the country they had helped build.

Gwen Cooper (Goodreads Author),Homer's Odyssey,,English,,"Once in nine lives, something extraordinary happens... The last thing Gwen Cooper wanted was another cat. She already had two, not to mention a phenomenally underpaying job and a recently broken heart. Then Gwen’s veterinarian called with a story about a three-week-old eyeless kitten who’d been abandoned. It was love at first sight.Everyone warned that Homer would always be an ""underachiever,"" never as playful or independent as other cats. But the kitten nobody believed in quickly grew into a three-pound dynamo, a tiny daredevil with a giant heart who eagerly made friends with every human who crossed his path. Homer scaled seven-foot bookcases with ease and leapt five feet into the air to catch flies in mid-buzz. He survived being trapped alone for days after 9/11 in an apartment near the World Trade Center, and even saved Gwen’s life when he chased off an intruder who broke into their home in the middle of the night.But it was Homer’s unswerving loyalty, his infinite capacity for love, and his joy in the face of all obstacles that inspired Gwen daily and transformed her life. And by the time she met the man she would marry, she realized Homer had taught her the most important lesson of all: Love isn’t something you see with your eyes.Homer’s Odyssey is the once-in-a-lifetime story of an extraordinary cat and his human companion. It celebrates the refusal to accept limits—on love, ability, or hope against overwhelming odds. By turns jubilant and moving, it’s a memoir for anybody who’s ever fallen completely and helplessly in love with a pet.",,,,August 25th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary']",,9780385343855,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442887803l/6261477._SY475_.jpg,4.2,[],63.0,1.0,,6261477-homer-s-odyssey,,,,,95.0,13757.0,287,,Delacorte Press,"['6557', '4357', '2106', '479', '258']",,,[],,

And maybe she should have trusted him with the secret she’s kept for four years—the secret that broke them up to begin with.",,,,April 25th 2010,[],Kindle Edition,"['Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'High School', 'Young Adult Romance', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Humor', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Young Adult Contemporary']",,B003JBI0QS,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1300892268l/8255649.jpg,3.84,[],84.0,1.0,,8255649-so-over-you,,,,,91.0,7799.0,226,,,"['2543', '2382', '2149', '543', '182']",,,[],,
Gwen Raverat,Period Piece: The Victorian Childhood of Charles Darwin's Granddaughter,,English,,"To celebrate 50 years in print, this is a special edition of this classic and much loved work. Gwen Raverat, the grand-daughter of Charles Darwin, described this memoir of her late Victorian Cambridge childhood as a drawing of the world when I was young. The observations of the small incidents in her life and of her eccentric Darwin family, recorded here both in her inimitably charming prose and her line drawings, reveal an artist's careful eye. Vividly evoking a bygone era, it is a shrewd, touching and comic portrait of her childhood, her eccentric relations, and of Cambridge academic society.

This hallucinatory document of dreams, obsession, and insanity has fascinated artists such as Joseph Cornell, who cited passages from it to explain his own work; Antonin Artaud, who saw his own madness mirrored by Nerval's; and Andre Breton, who placed Nerval in the highest echelon of Surrealist heroes.

"Gündüz Vassaf, Ömer Madra (Translator), Zehra Gençosman (Translator)",Cehenneme Övgü,,Turkish,,"Totalitarizmin kendini yeniden üretmesi, yalnızca baskıcı güçlerin zora dayalı yöntemleriyle değil, bireylerin de sınırlı bir özgürlüğe razı olmasıyla gerçekleşir. Yaratıcılığını zorlayarak özgürlüğünü zenginleştirme çabasına girmeyen birey, var olanla yaşamayı seçer. Bu noktada düzen, bireyin onayıyla ayakta kalıyordur artık. “Seçme özgürlüğü” düzenin sunduğu çeşitlilik oranında vardır: “Ya şu ya da bu”dur. Gündüz Vassaf ise böylesi bir “seçme özgürlüğü”nün tutsaklaştırıcı yanlarına dikkat çekerek “ya hep ya da hiç”i önerir... Ve totalitarizmi ayakta tutan kimi kavramların ne denli kof olduğunu gösterir: Gündüze karşı geceden, cennete karşı cehennemden, konuşmaya karşı sessizlikten, akla karşı delilikten, anlaşmaya karşı anlaşmazlıktan... yana olur. Kahramanlığa karşı çıkar, “hain”leri savunur...“En azından, ortaya konulan ‘metin’ anlamında özgür bir ‘kafa’ var karşımızda. ‘Kafasız bir dünya’ ya da ‘Dünyasız bir kafa’dan sıyrılıyor Vassaf. Yaratıcı bir ‘karışıklık’tan ve ‘düzensizlik’ten zerre kadar korkmuyor.”Tunca Arslan / 2000’e Doğru“Şeytanın avukatlığı konusunda son derece içten olan bir yazardan, zaman zaman neredeyse edebi tatlar da taşıyan çarpıcı denemeler. Bu kitabı çok sevebilirsiniz ya da sinir olabilirsiniz; ama kayıtsız kalmayın.”Murat Aykul / Aktüel“Gündüz Vassaf bizim bu duygularımızı kıpırdatmaya çalışıyor. Onu okurken hem heyecan duyuyor hem de yazdıklarına tepki duyuyoruz. Kıpırdayan duyularımız ile aklımız arasındaki mesafesel ilişki koparılıyor: Özgürcesine havalanıyor, bir boşlukta yere düşmeden evvel duyulan heyecanı, terleyerek taşıyoruz.”Ali Akay / Varlık“Belki de bu dönemle başedebilmemiz, kültür tarihinin birçok geçmiş başarısına birden başvurmamızla olanaklı olacak. Vassaf’ın kitabı da bu başvuru için el altında tutmamız gereken bir kitap.”Oruç Aruoba / Cumhuriyet Kitap“Epey cüretli bir deneme: Oralardan bir tek tanrı bakabilir çünkü; bir de şeytan tabii. Biraz zorlama pahasına, ‘çocuksu ve şeytansı bir tanrının bakışı’ diyebilir miyiz?”Ömer Madra / Cumhuriyet Kitap“Cehenneme Övgü, gönüllü köleliğimizin dayanaklarını ve onu yeniden üreten ‘çağdaş demokratik’ aygıtları önümüze seren, totalitarizmin rafine biçimlerine dikkat çeken, asla üstünden atlanıp geçilmeyecek bir kitap.
