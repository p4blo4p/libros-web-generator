Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success,,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Leadership', 'Personal Development', 'Management', 'Buisness', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook']","Give and Take highlights what effective networking, collaboration, influence, negotiation, and leadership skills have in common.For generations, we have focused on the individual drivers of success: passion, hard work, talent, and luck. But today, success is increasingly dependent on how we interact with others. It turns out that at work, most people operate as either takers, matchers, or givers. Whereas takers strive to get as much as possible from others and matchers aim to trade evenly, givers are the rare breed of people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return. Using his own pioneering research as Wharton's youngest tenured professor, Grant shows that these styles have a surprising impact on success. Although some givers get exploited and burn out, the rest achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries. Combining cutting-edge evidence with captivating stories, this landmark book shows how one of America's best networkers developed his connections, why the creative genius behind one of the most popular shows in television history toiled for years in anonymity, how a basketball executive responsible for multiple draft busts transformed his franchise into a winner, and how we could have anticipated Enron's demise four years before the company collapsed - without ever looking at a single number.

Sophie was everything he refused to want. Her temper, her wit, her laugh, her smile, the way her entire body goes up in flames under his hands are things he would rather slam a lid on and forget. Instead, he finds himself falling for the smart-mouth next door. But how long will he have before the evil chasing them catches up? How long before the very thing he never wanted becomes his only thread to sanity? And who is after them? What do they want and why do they want Spencer and Sophie dead?",,,01/14/13,February 14th 2013,"['Sophia Marie Valdez', 'Spencer Mason Rowth', 'Lauren Woodrow', 'Jessica Bishop', 'Jackie Rowth', 'Jamie Rowth', 'Joseph Blake', 'Mary Valdez', 'Detective McLeary', 'Maggie Chow', 'Tiffany Palmer', 'Grandma Valdez', 'Bill Rouster', 'Bull-Guy', 'Brian Fisher', 'Roy Praxton']",,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1392245339l/17202780.jpg,3.97,[],98.0,1.0,,,,92.0,1588.0,475,Airicka Pheonix,"['599', '516', '343', '89', '41']",,[],,['Airicka Phoenix']

Gaibéus,,"['Portugal', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Social', 'Romance', 'Novels']","«O romance Gaibéus foi publicado pela primeira vez em 1939. É o ponto de partida da obra romanesca de Alves Redol. Mas é também o ponto de chegada de uma longa reflexão do autor sobre o significado e o papel da arte, o primeiro edifício do programa de uma literatura nova. Dessa reflexão de Redol ficou uma série de artigos publicados em jornais de Vila Franca de Xira, onde vivia — Vida Ribatejana (entre 1927 e 1934) e Mensageiro do Ribatejo (entre 1934 e 1940). De destacar ainda a conferência sobre arte, proferida em Vila Franca em 1936. Fiel ao seu ideário, Redol, antes de escrever Gaibéus, realizou um amplo ""trabalho de campo"" — deslocou-se repetidas vezes à lezíria, chegou mesmo a instalar-se no campo para recolher dados sobre o trabalho nos arrozais. Os seus blocos de apontamentos contêm numerosas indicações técnicas sobre o cultivo do arroz. As próprias relações familiares lhe serviram de documento — o pai de Redol era oriundo da região de origem dos gaibéus. Hoje Gaibéus é comummente aceite como o romance que marca o aparecimento do neo-realismo em Portugal.Eis o mundo que Alves Redol nos apresenta no seu primeiro romance. História da alienação de uma comunidade de trabalhadores, ficamos a saber até que ponto são explorados, e até que ponto essa exploração se deve à falta de união com outras comunidades de jornaleiros. Gaibéus é, assim, o romance do divórcio entre ganhões, uns procurando resgatar algumas bouças ou sulcos que ainda lhes pertencem, outros alheios ao que seja possuir qualquer chalorda ou mesmo canteiro.

Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', '18th Century', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Regency']","The winner of Britain's prestigious Whitbread Prize and a bestseller there for months, this wonderfully readable biography offers a rich, rollicking picture of late-eighteenth-century British aristocracy and the intimate story of a woman who for a time was its undisputed leader.Lady Georgiana Spencer was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales, and was nearly as famous in her day. In 1774, at the age of seventeen, Georgiana achieved immediate celebrity by marrying one of England's richest and most influential aristocrats, the Duke of Devonshire. Launched into a world of wealth and power, she quickly became the queen of fashionable society, adored by the Prince of Wales, a dear friend of Marie-Antoinette, and leader of the most important salon of her time. Not content with the role of society hostess, she used her connections to enter politics, eventually becoming more influential than most of the men who held office. Her good works and social exploits made her loved by the multitudes, but Georgiana's public success, like Diana's, concealed a personal life that was fraught with suffering. The Duke of Devonshire was unimpressed by his wife's legendary charms, preferring instead those of her closest friend, a woman with whom Georgiana herself was rumored to be on intimate terms. For over twenty years, the three lived together in a jealous and uneasy ménage à trois, during which time both women bore the Duke's children—as well as those of other men.Foreman's descriptions of Georgiana's uncontrollable gambling, all-night drinking, drug taking, and love affairs with the leading politicians of the day give us fascinating insight into the lives of the British aristocracy in the era of the madness of King George III, the American and French revolutions, and the defeat of Napoleon. A gifted young historian whom critics are already likening to Antonia Fraser, Amanda Foreman draws on a wealth of fresh research and writes colorfully and penetratingly about the fascinating Georgiana, whose struggle against her own weaknesses, whose great beauty and flamboyance, and whose determination to play a part in the affairs of the world make her a vibrant, astonishingly contemporary figure.",,,10/29/98,January 16th 2001,"['George IV', 'Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire', 'William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire']",Paperback,,9780375753831,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332041559l/319300.jpg,3.79,['Whitbread Award for Biography (1998)'],248.0,3.0,,,,89.0,17253.0,456,Modern Library,"['4962', '6172', '4284', '1230', '605']",,[],,['Amanda Foreman']

"Guilty: Liberal ""Victims"" and Their Assault on America",,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Comedy', 'Humor', 'Political Science', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural']","“Liberals seem to have hit upon a reverse Christ story as their belief system. He suffered and died for our sins; liberals make the rest of us suffer for sins we didn’t commit.”Who are the victims here? To hear liberals tell it, you’d think they do nothing but suffer at the hands of ruthless entities like the “Republican Attack Machine” and Fox News.Really?It’s just another instance of the Big Lie, of course, told so often that some people have actually started to believe it. In Guilty, Ann Coulter explodes this myth to reveal that when it comes to bullying, no one outdoes the Left. Citing case after case, ranging from the hilariously absurd to the shockingly vicious, Coulter dissects these so-called victims who are invariably the oppressors. For instance:•Single mothers: Getting pregnant isn’t like catching the flu. There are volitional acts involved–someone else explain it to Dennis Kucinich. By this purposeful act, single mothers cause irreparable harm to other human beings–their own children–as countless studies on the subject make clear.•The myth of the Republican Attack Machine: The most amazing thing liberals have done is create the myth of a compliant right-wing media with Republicans badgering baffled reporters into attacking Democrats. It’s so mad, it’s brilliant. It’s one kind of lie to say the Holocaust occurred when the Swedes killed the Jews. But it’s another kind of lie entirely to say the Holocaust occurred when the Jews killed the Nazis.•“Brave” liberals: In addition to being beautiful, compassionate tribunes of the downtrodden, liberals are brave. I know that because they’re always telling me how brave they are. Why, five nights a week, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann courageously books guests who completely agree with him. It doesn’t get much braver than that.•Obambi’s luck: While B. Hussein Obama piously condemned attacks on candidates’ ­families, his media and campaign surrogates ripped open the court-sealed divorce records of his two principal opponents in his Senate race in Illinois.•The offenders are offended!: Republican senator George Allen’s career was destroyed when he made a joking remark to a privileged Indian American harassing him at campaign stops. When did rich kids become a new protected category that must be shielded from words that are insulting in other languages? How did Sidarth become a specially anointed victim? What did we ever do to India? And why didn’t we ever hear about the far more offensive anti-Semitic flyers of Allen’s opponent Jim Webb?One essential and recurring truth about self-righteous liberals, says Coulter, is that “they viciously attack all while wailing that they are the true victims.” With Guilty–a mordantly witty and shockingly specific catalog of offenses that liberals would rather we ignore and forget–Ann Coulter presents exhibits A through Z.From the Hardcover edition.",,Large Print,10/29/08,January 6th 2009,[],Paperback,,9780739328064,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320400867l/6076107.jpg,3.58,[],193.0,3.0,,,,79.0,2427.0,496,Random House Large Print,"['812', '664', '453', '125', '373']",,[],,['Ann Coulter']
Godless: The Church of Liberalism,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'Political Science', 'Cultural', 'History', 'Evolution', 'Womens']","""If a martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation's official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law. Many Americans are outraged by liberal hostility to traditional religion. But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism ""is"" a religion--a godless one. And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county. Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In ""Godless,"" Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ (""Roe v. Wade""), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the ""absolute moral authority"" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident). Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: ""it is bogus science."" Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is--Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the ""evolving"" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom? Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion. Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, ""Godless"" is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices. ""Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious, ' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion.

Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh’s musings on the shape of a woman’s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives.With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, Gift from the Sea continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh’s daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman.The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s life. She spent her childhood summers with her family on a Maine island. After her marriage to Charles Lindbergh in 1929, she accompanied him on his survey flights around the North Atlantic to launch the first transoceanic airlines.

Games of Strategy,,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Textbooks', 'Mathematics', 'Science', 'School', 'Psychology', 'Popular Science', 'Games']","All introductory textbooks begin by attempting to convince the student readers that the subject is of great importance in the world, and therefore merits their attention. The physical sciences and engineering claim to be the basis of modern technology and therefore of modern life; the social sciences discuss big issues of governance, for example, democracy and taxation; the humanities claim that they revive your soul after it has been deadened by exposure to the physical and social sciences and to engineering. Where does the subject ""games of strategy,"" often also called game theory, fit into this picture, and why should you study it? Dixit and Skeath's Games of Strategy offers a practical motivation much more individual and closer to your personal concerns than most other subjects. You play games of strategy all the time: with your parents, siblings, friends, enemies, even with your professors. You have probably acquired a lot of instinctive expertise, and we hope you will recognize in what follows some of the lessons you have already learned. This book's authors will build on this experience, systematize it, and develop it to the point where you will be able to improve your strategic skills and use them more methodically. Opportunities for such uses will appear throughout the rest of your life; you will go on playing such games with your employers, employees, spouses, children, and even strangers.  Not that the subject lacks wider importance. Similar games are played in business, politics, diplomacy, wars--in fact, whenever people interact to strike mutually agreeable deals or to resolve conflicts. Being able to recognize such games will enrich your understanding of the world around you, and will make you a better participant in all its affairs.",,Second Edition,06/06/99,January 1st 2004,[],Hardcover,,9780393924992,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171407279l/98219._SX318_.jpg,3.97,[],51.0,1.0,,,,91.0,259.0,665,W.

Gifted Hands will transplace you into the operating room to witness surgeries that made headlines around the world, and into the private mind of a compassionate, God-fearing physician who lives to help others. In 1987, Dr. Carson gained worldwide recognition for his part in the first successful separation of Siamese twins joined at the back of the head -- an extremely complex and delicate operation that was five months of planning and twenty-two hours of actual surgery, involving a surgical plan that Carson helped initiate. Gifted Hands reveals a man with humility, decency, compassion, courage, and sensitivity who serves as a role model for young people (and everyone else) in need of encouragement to attempt the seemingly impossible and to excel in whatever they attempt. Dr. Carson also describes the key role that his highly intelligent though relatively uneducated mother played in his metamorphosis from an unmotivated ghetto youngster into one of the most respected neurosurgeons in the world.",,,02/10/92,November 26th 1996,"['Ben Carson', 'Sonya Carson', 'Robert Solomon Carson', 'Lacena Rustin Carson']",Paperback,,9780310214694,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331248043l/18422.jpg,4.18,[],192.0,2.0,,,,94.0,16553.0,224,Zondervan,"['7690', '5460', '2416', '635', '352']",,[],,"['Ben Carson', 'Cecil Murphey']"

Set in 90s Manhattan, Victor Ward, a model with perfect abs and all the right friends, is seen and photographed everywhere, even in places he hasn't been and with people he doesn't know. He's living with one beautiful model and having an affair with another onthe eve of opening the trendiest nightclub in New York City history.And now it's time to move to the next stage. But the future he gets is not the one he had in mind. With the same deft satire and savage wit he has brought to his other fiction, Bret Ellis gets beyond the facade and introduces us, unsparingly, to what we always feared was behind it. Glamorama shows us a shadowy looking-glass reality, the juncture where fame and fashion and terror and mayhem meet and then begin to resemble the familiar surface of our lives.""",,,10/28/98,March 21st 2000,"['Victor Ward', 'F.

""His whole vision of life was such that the natural and the supernatural seemed inseparably combined.""It is precisely this pervasive Christianity which is demonstrated in the forty-eight essays comprising God in the Dock. Here Lewis addresses himself both to theological questions and to those which Hooper terms ""semi-theological,"" or ethical. But whether he is discussing ""Evil and God,"" ""Miracles,"" ""The Decline of Religion,"" or ""The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment,"" his insight and observations are thoroughly and profoundly Christian.Drawn from a variety of sources, the essays were designed to meet a variety of needs, and among other accomplishments they serve to illustrate the many different angles from which we are able to view the Christian religion. They range from relatively popular pieces written for newspapers to more learned defenses of the faith which first appeared in The Socratic Digest.

Gastien: The Beginning (The Gastien Series),,[],"Dear Readers: Please note the * toward the end of description.When young Gastien Beauchamp flees the farm for Paris, the late nineteenth century bohemian era is in full swing. Color has always called to him, beseeching him to capture it on canvas and show people a new way of seeing things. His father belittled his dream of being an artist and tried to beat him into giving it up. The dream wouldn’t die, but Gastien would have had he not left.He also yearns to become a great lover. After the years of anguish he has endured at the hand of his father, it would be heaven to feel pleasure instead of pain.However, the city of Paris has a ruthless agenda. Unless a man has money and connections, Paris unfeelingly crushes dreams and destroys souls. With neither of the required assets, Gastien faces living in alleys, digging in trash bins for food, and sleeping where a man is often killed for his threadbare blanket.Left with only his dreams, Gastien stubbornly pushes on. He vows that absolutely nothing will stop him, not yet realizing what keeping that vow might mean. Sometimes the “impossible” is possible – but the cost can be extremely high.*This book contains the first twelve chapters -- almost 83,000 words -- of Gastien Part 1: The Cost of the Dream, the first volume in “The Gastien Series”. “Gastien: The Beginning” is only meant to give the reader a good sample of the storyline, the author’s style, and the chance to see if they want to commit to a full series of an ADULT drama/family saga that is also steeped in history. Please understand that this sample is not a stand- alone book, although the reader will experience more than what is usually the size of a full length novel (most are 60,000 to 70,000 words).

"Gravity's Engines: How Bubble-Blowing Black Holes Rule Galaxies, Stars, and Life in the Cosmos",,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Astronomy', 'Popular Science', 'Audiobook', 'Space']","One of The Barnes and Noble Review Editors' Picks: Best Nonfiction of 2012Selected by The Christian Science Monitor as one of ""21 smart nonfiction titles we think you'll enjoy this summer""Selected by The New Scientist as one of 10 books to look out for in 2012We've long understood black holes to be the points at which the universe as we know it comes to an end. Often billions of times more massive than the Sun, they lurk in the inner sanctum of almost every galaxy of stars in the universe. They're mysterious chasms so destructive and unforgiving that not even light can escape their deadly wrath.Recent research, however, has led to a cascade of new discoveries that have revealed an entirely different side to black holes. As the astrophysicist Caleb Scharf reveals in Gravity's Engines, these chasms in space-time don't just vacuum up everything that comes near them; they also spit out huge beams and clouds of matter. Black holes blow bubbles.With clarity and keen intellect, Scharf masterfully explains how these bubbles profoundly rearrange the cosmos around them. Engaging with our deepest questions about the universe, he takes us on an intimate journey through the endlessly colorful place we call our galaxy and reminds us that the Milky Way sits in a special place in the cosmic zoo—a ""sweet spot"" of properties. Is it coincidental that we find ourselves here at this place and time? Could there be a deeper connection between the nature of black holes and their role in the universe and the phenomenon of life?

Everywhere he turns, he sees people falling in love, getting married and starting families. It’s enough to make a grown man want to rip out his own hair. And for a cynic like Grey, one more employee getting engaged signals the need for a long overdue vacation. Grey owns a cabin in the mountains he has never even used, and he figures that’s just the ticket out of this nightmare of happily paired-up couples.Grey doesn’t expect to be greeted by a belligerent, half-naked man the minute he opens his cabin door.Sirus Wilder has known Grey’s twin sister for years, and she has given him permission to stay in the cabin while his residence across the lake is under repair. Sirus has never met Greyson Cole before, but he is thankful when the man lets him share the cabin for a few days. There is plenty enough room for them each to keep to themselves. Sirus has had his heart broken and isn’t interested in a hook-up, let alone something more.Even so, Grey is, hands-down, one of the sexiest men Sirus has ever seen. Too bad he’s an arrogant ass and his eyes are so damn cold. Every once in a while, though, Sirus thinks he sees a hint of fiery passion in the controlled man sleeping one room away.For Grey, one look at the roughly handsome Sirus puts Grey’s celibacy pact in serious jeopardy.

It seems as though a growing group women entrepreneurs all around the world has discovered the secret to success and happiness in both their lives and careers. It's almost as though there is a hidden, underground world of power playing females who have all cracked a magical code: they think positively, they support one another, and they truly believe they can have it all -and you can, too. There is something dynamic that happens when women genuinely show up for each other. When we lose the facades, when we cut the bullsh*t, and when we truly have each others backs. When we stop pretending everything is perfect, and we show the messy, beautiful parts of ourselves and our work that all look awfully similar. When we talk about our fears, our missteps, and our breakdowns. And most importantly, when we share our celebrations, our breakthroughs, and dish on what works. There is no reason to hoard information, connections, or insight. Wisdom is meant to be shared, so let's start sharing what we've learned to make each other better. Let's start building each other up. Let's live up to our potential and start ruling the world.

When the grave is opened, Harper's claim is proven true. The dead girl is Tabitha Morgenstern, an eleven-year-old abducted from Nashville two years previously - a child whom Harper had tried, and failed, to find.

The area of the Central Valley where fourteen-year-old Lacey May and her alcoholic mother live was once an agricultural paradise. Now it’s an environmental disaster, a place of cracked earth and barren raisin farms. In their desperation, residents have turned to a cult leader named Pastor Vern for guidance. He promises, through secret “assignments,” to bring the rain everybody is praying for. Lacey has no reason to doubt the pastor. But then her life explodes in a single unimaginable act of abandonment: her mother, exiled from the community for her sins, leaves Lacey and runs off with a man she barely knows. Abandoned and distraught, Lacey May moves in with her widowed grandma, Cherry, who is more concerned with her taxidermy mice collection than her own granddaughter. As Lacey May endures the increasingly appalling acts of men who want to write all the rules, and begins to uncover the full extent of Pastor Vern’s shocking plan to bring fertility back to the land, she decides she must go on a quest to find her mother, no matter what it takes. With her only guidance coming from the romance novels she reads and the unlikely companionship of the women who knew her mother, she must find her own way through unthinkable circumstances.Possessed of an unstoppable plot and a brilliantly soulful voice, Godshot is a book of grit and humor and heart, a debut novel about female friendship and resilience, mother-loss and motherhood, and seeking salvation in unexpected places.

Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture,,"['Architecture', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Space', 'Urban', 'Art']","From the author’s preface:The present book forms a sequel to…Intentions in Architecture and Existence, Space and Architecture. It also relates to…Meaning in Western Architecture. Common to all of them is the view that architecture represents a means to give man an “existential foothold”…The philosophy of Heidegger has been the catalyst which has made the present book possible and determined its approach. The wish for understanding architecture as a concrete phenomenon…could be satisfied in the present book…thanks to Heidegger’s essays on language and aesthetics.Man dwells when he can orient himself within and identify himself with an environment, or, in short, when he experiences the environment as meaningful. Dwelling therefore implies something more than “shelter”. It implies that the spaces where life occurs are places, in the true sense of the word. A place is a space which has a distinct character. Since ancient times the genius loci, or “spirit of place”, has been recognized as the concrete reality man has to face and come to terms with in his daily life. Architecture means to visualize the genius loci, and the task of the architect is to create meaningful places, whereby he helps man to dwell.",,,11/06/79,June 15th 1991,[],Paperback,,9780847802876,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388367086l/418524.jpg,4.28,[],71.0,1.0,,,,96.0,407.0,216,Rizzoli,"['201', '142', '47', '10', '7']",,[],,['Christian Norberg-Schulz']

Temujin's young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured--and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon.  Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin's legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced--from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte. Blessed with ferocious courage, it was the young warrior's ability to learn, to imagine, and to judge the hearts of others that propelled him to greater and greater power. Until Temujin was chasing a vision: to unite many tribes into one, to make the earth tremble under the hoofbeats of a thousand warhorses, to subject unknown nations and even empires to his will.

The warlike German tribes are the focus of Tacitus' attention in the Germania, which, like the Agricola, often compares the behaviour of 'barbarian' peoples favourably with the decadence and corruption of Imperial Rome.",,,,1970.0,,,0140442413,9780140442410,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-TCOs_SFAy0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.98,,,,,,,,,174.0,,,3895.0,,,['Cornelius Tacitus']
Granted,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction']","""Granted"" tells the story of how a “Wish Giver” named Alexander meets a high school student named Natalie “Talie” Corte; an encounter which permanently alters both their lives.Wish Givers can best be described as modern-day genies. These Wish Givers were once humans who have been cursed to endure a life of unending servitude to whomever touches their skin. When their masters die, they are set free until touched again, and it is only when they are unbound that they can be killed. Alexander has been passed down in one family from generation to generation until the death of his most recent master, after which he managed to escape. With his new-found freedom he has decided to end his life, finding death preferable to continuing his eternity of servitude.Natalie happens upon Alex just before he can attempt to jump off of a freeway overpass. She ends up barely brushing her fingers against his, and he becomes her servant for the duration of her life.Having only served older, very greedy men (who had all descended from the Spanish Conquistadors) serving a teenage girl was completely foreign to him. Both Alexander and Natalie find themselves unprecedentedly frustrated with the mundane quality of her hidden desires.Alexander has the ability and the obligation to grant Talie’s every whim, both spoken and unspoken. He can hear her thoughts to the extent of what she wants, but no more than that. This presents Alex with an endless stream of idle wonderings, dreams, and fancies that amuse him to grant, but also make him feel his days have become quite tedious. However, Talie learns that having every request fulfilled in a flash can have the gravest of consequences.",The Wishgiver Trilogy #1,,,July 5th 2013,[],Kindle Edition,,B00DT54NXS,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1376523046l/18209791.jpg,3.62,[],89.0,1.0,,,,81.0,21.0,457,Hibiscus Ink,"['5', '8', '4', '3', '1']",,[],,['Corrien Killmer']

"Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith and Love",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Biography', 'Italy', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'Religion', 'Astronomy', 'Memoir']","Dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion.Inspired by a long fascination with Galileo, and by the remarkable surviving letters of Galileo's daughter, a cloistered nun, Dava Sobel has written a biography unlike any other of the man Albert Einstein called ""the father of modern physics--indeed of modern science altogether."" Galileo's Daughter also presents a stunning portrait of a person hitherto lost to history, described by her father as ""a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness, and most tenderly attached to me."" The son of a musician, Galileo Gahlei (1564-1642) tried at first to enter a monastery before engaging the skills that made him the foremost scientist of his day. Though he never left Italy, his inventions and discoveries were heralded around the world. Most sensationally, his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens and to reinforce the astounding argument that the Earth moves around the Sun. For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, accused of heresy, and forced to spend his last years under house arrest. Of Galileo's three illegitimate children, the eldest best mirrored his own brilliance, industry, and sensibility, and by virtue of these qualities became his confidante. Born Virginia in 1600, she was thirteen when Galileo placed her in a convent near him in Florence, where she took the most appropriate name of Suor Maria Celeste. Her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father's greatest source of strength throughout his most productive and tumultuous years. Her presence, through letters which Sobel has translated from their original Italian and masterfully woven into the narrative, graces her father's life now as it did then. Galileo's Daughter dramatically recolors the personality and accomplishment of a mythic figure whose seventeenth-century clash with Catholic doctrine continues to define the schism between science and religion. Moving between Galileo's grand public life and Maria Celeste's sequestered world, Sobel illuminates the Florence of the Medicis and the papal court in Rome during the pivotal era when humanity's perception of its place in the cosmos was being overturned. In that same time, while the bubonic plague wreaked its terrible devastation and the Thirty Years' War tipped fortunes across Europe, one man sought to reconcile the Heaven he revered as a good Catholic with the heavens he revealed through his telescope. With all the human drama and scientific adventure that distinguished Longitude, Galileo's Daughter is an unforgettable story.",,,10/01/99,November 1st 2000,"['Galileo Galilei', 'Sister Maria Celeste']",Paperback,,9780140280555,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414607526l/18646.jpg,3.75,"['Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) for History (2000)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Science & Technology (1999)']",87.0,1.0,,,,89.0,27426.0,420,Penguin Books (NYC),"['7107', '10159', '7210', '2019', '931']",,[],,['Dava Sobel']
"Game Changers: What Leaders, Innovators, and Mavericks Do to Win at Life",,"['Health', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Nutrition', 'Science']","
  The bestselling author of Head Strong and The Bulletproof Diet answers the question, “How can I kick more ass at life?” by culling the wisdom of world-class thought leaders, maverick scientists, and disruptive entrepreneurs to provide proven techniques for becoming happier, healthier, and smarter.
When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists toiling in unknown laboratories to business leaders changing the world to mediation masters discovering inner peace. His guests were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What made them so successful—and what made them tick? At the end of each interview, Dave asked the same question: “What are your top three recommendations for people who want to perform better at being human?”After performing a statistical analysis of the answers, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people could be distilled into three main objectives: finding ways to become smarter, faster, and happier. Game Changers is the culmination of Dave’s years-long immersion in these conversations, offering 46 science-backed, high performance “laws” that are a virtual playbook for how to get better at life.With anecdotes from game changers like Dr. Daniel Amen, Gabby Bernstein, Dr. David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Esther Perel, and Tim Ferris as well as examples from Dave’s own life, Game Changers offers readers practical advice they can put into action to reap immediate rewards. From taming fear and anxiety to making better decisions, establishing high-performance habits, and practicing gratitude and mindfulness, Dave brings together the wisdom of today’s game-changers to help everyone kick more ass at life.",,,,December 4th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,,B077XG39QR,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527253913l/40209370._SY475_.jpg,4.07,[],97.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1573.0,352,Harper Wave,"['634', '542', '294', '80', '23']",,[],,['Dave Asprey']

In the midst of this isolated bastion of democratic values, Miguel finds more than a new life— he finds someone to live for. Miren Ansotegui is a charismatic and graceful dancer who has her pick of the bachelors in Guernica, but focuses only on the charming and mysterious Miguel. The two discover a love that war and tragedy can not destroy.History and fiction merge seamlessly in this beautiful novel about the resilience of family, love, and tradition in the face of hardship. The bombing of Guernica was a devastating experiment in total warfare by the German Luftwaffe in the run-up to World War II. For Basques, it was an attack on the soul of their ancient nation; for the world, it was an unprecedented crime against humanity.

What is the common thread of coincidence or destiny that connects the lives of these nine souls in nine far-flung countries, stretching across the globe from east to west? What pattern do their linked fates form through time and space?A writer of pyrotechnic virtuosity and profound compassion, a mind to which nothing human is alien, David Mitchell spins genres, cultures, and ideas like gossamer threads around and through these nine linked stories. Many forces bind these lives, but at root all involve the same universal longing for connection and transcendence, an axis of commonality that leads in two directions—to creation and to destruction. In the end, as lives converge with a fearful symmetry, Ghostwritten comes full circle, to a point at which a familiar idea—that whether the planet is vast or small is merely a matter of perspective—strikes home with the force of a new revelation.

Gorillas among Us: A Primate Ethnographer’s Book of Days,,"['Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'Science']","Dawn Prince-Hughes is an extraordinary researcher. She does not experiment or measure but instead sits on a wooden bench for hours each day, watching captive gorillas through the enclosure where other visitors average five-second stops. Her patience is rewarded with astounding observations—she watches gorillas make and use tools, bury a dead crow, give birth, and comfort and care for each other.In Gorillas among Us, Prince-Hughes has compressed years of gorilla observation into a composite diary chronicling the days of one gorilla family. She creates a blended portrait of both peoples—gorilla and human. The entries capture significant observations, which often prompt brief discussions of gorillas’ captivity, diet, communication, aesthetic preferences, social behavior, and play. Several chapters end with thought-provoking meditations on human values. The final section, “More about Gorillas,” provides a concise, accessible introduction to gorilla natural history.This book will delight and move anyone with an interest in animals, and it also makes a significant contribution to the scarce literature on captive gorillas. Prince-Hughes's observations of tool use by gorillas will interest scientists, and even a casual reader will come away with a new sense of the power of observation. The author hopes to change the way we look at animals in the wild and in captivity, and laments that zoo visitors pause so briefly in front of the gorilla enclosure, rushing on with their assumptions unchanged, without really seeing the gorillas.By turns opinionated and descriptive, quirky and authoritative, Prince-Hughes draws us into the family life of captive gorillas and into a consideration of our own culture. Readers will learn something new about gorillas and themselves on every page of this poignant story. The book testifies to the potential for interspecies compassion and the love that one person can find in a family of gorillas.",,,,September 1st 2001,[],Paperback,,9780816521517,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347569410l/1318536.jpg,3.7,[],73.0,1.0,,,,91.0,23.0,153,University of Arizona Press,"['6', '8', '7', '0', '2']",,[],,['Dawn Prince-Hughes']

God's Guest List: Welcoming Those Who Influence Our Lives,,"['Nonfiction', 'Inspirational', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Romance', 'Spirituality']","Who is on God’s “guest list” for your life . . . and why? The answers may surprise you.Through touching true stories and inspiring insight Debbie Macomber takes readers on a journey to discover the shaping influence others have on us and the power we have to shape and influence those whose paths cross ours.Each of us have “influencers” that have affected our lives—some from a distance, some through word or deed, some through example, be it good or bad. Often we don’t even recognize the deep impact others have had and how God has used them to shape us into who we are. By pausing to recognize these influences we begin to grasp how God’s guest list had a purpose far beyond what we imagined. We begin to see the seeds of influence that grew into our personal values and character.In some people God invites into our lives, we see only what appears to be painful or negative influence. We bear the scars of disappointment, hurt, betrayal, and pain. Here Macomber redirects our attention, opening our eyes to how those experiences prompted strength, resilience, resolve, decisions, and choices about how we would change and who we would become. In other instances, God has surprised us with just the people at just the right time to support, teach, lead, or love us, but perhaps we haven't quite recognized God's timing and work through these ""guests.""But perhaps the greatest treasure this book holds is the power to grasp our own power to influence others, and even to anticipate what lives we have yet to touch. In the tradition of How to Win Friends and Influence People, Macomber casts a vision to seize every opportunity to be a positive and faithful influence on others. With this realization comes the willingness and anticipation to live with the door of our lives wide open to greet each new life God brings across the threshold.God's Guest List is filled with true stories and rich insight that will forever change how you see the people in your life.",,,,November 2nd 2010,[],Hardcover,,9781439108963,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439151474l/7936932._SY475_.jpg,3.99,[],70.0,1.0,,,,93.0,815.0,190,Howard Books,"['297', '286', '173', '46', '13']",,[],,['Debbie MacOmber']
Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Paranormal', 'Ghosts', 'Psychology', 'Biography', 'Spiritualism', 'Historical', 'Supernatural']","What if a world-renowned professor of psychology at Harvard University, a doctor and scientist acclaimed as one of the leading intellects of the time, suddenly announced that he believed in ghosts? At the close of the nineteenth century, to great public and professional astonishment, William James-the great philosopher, a founder of the American Psychological Association and brother of Henry James-did just that and embarked on a determined, lifelong pursuit of scientific evidence to prove it.  James came together with two other brilliant and charismatic thinkers of the day-Richard Hodgson, a converted skeptic, and James Hyslop, a natural grandstander who would often visit mediums unannounced, a hooded mask covering his face-to form the core of the American Society for Psychical Research. They eventually merged with the British Society for Psychical Research, adding to the group the Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick and his tiny, ferociously smart wife Eleanor, as well as the mythically handsome Edmund Gurney and others. While studies of ESP and ghostly visitations have occurred since the days of the society, at no other time have scientists of the caliber of James and his colleagues devoted themselves in such an ambitious and driven way for evidence of a life beyond. James and his band of brothers staked their reputations, their careers, even their sanity, on one of the most extraordinary (and entertaining) psychological quests ever undertaken, a quest that brought its followers right up against the limits of science.  This riveting book is about the investigation of the ghost stories-the instances of supernatural phenomena that could not be explained away-and it is about the courage and conviction of William James and his colleagues to study science with an open mind. At the heart of the story is the ongoing tension between empiricism and spiritualism-between a way of explaining the world that is grounded in the purely tangible and a way that is grounded in a mixture of the evident and the hidden. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Deborah Blum uses her extraordinary storytelling skills and scientific insight to explore nothing less than the nexus of science and religion.

Gemini,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Scotland', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Historical Romance', 'Literature', 'Adult', 'France']","Scotland, 1477: Nicholas de Fleury, former banker and merchant, has re-appeared in the land that, four years earlier, he had brought very close to ruin in the course of an intense commercial and personal war with secret enemies--and, indeed, with his clever wife Gelis.Now the opportunity for redemption is at hand, but Nicholas soon finds himself pursuing his objectives amid a complex, corrosive power struggle centering on the Scottish royal family but closely involving the powerful merchants of Edinburgh, the gentry, the clergy, the English (ever seeking an excuse to pounce on their neighbor to the north), the French, the Burgundians. His presence soon draws Gelis and their son Jodi to Scotland, as well as Nicholas's companions and subordinates in many a past endeavor--Dr. Tobias and his wife Clémence, Mick Crackbene, John le Grant, and Andro Wodman among them. Here, too, Nicholas meets again with others who have had an influence, for good or evil, in his life: King James III of Scotland and his rebellious siblings; the St. Pols: Jordan, Simon, and young Henry; Mistress Bel of Cuthilgurdy and David de Salmeton; Anselm Adorne and Kathi his niece. Caught up in, and sometimes molding, the course of great events, Nicholas exhibits by turns the fierce silence with which he masks his secrets, and the explosive, willful gaiety that binds men, women, and children to him. And as the secrets of his birth and heritage come to light, Nicholas has to decide whether he desires to establish a future in Scotland for himself and his family, and a home for his descendants.Gemini brings to a dazzling conclusion Dorothy Dunnett's House of Niccolò series (synopsized in this volume), in which this peerless novelist has vividly re-created the dramatic, flamboyant world of the early Renaissance in historical writing of scrupulous authenticity and in the entrancing portrait of her visionary hero. Now, in a book infused with wit and poetry, emotion and humor, action and mystery, she brings Nicholas de Fleury at last to choose his heart's home, where he can exercise all his skills as an advisor to kings and statesmen, as a husband, a father, and a leader of men--and where, perhaps, we will discern a connection between him and that other remarkable personality, Francis Crawford, whose exploits Lady Dunnett recorded so memorably in The Lymond Chronicles.",The House of Niccolò #8,,11/06/00,May 8th 2001,[],Paperback,,9780375708565,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542323118l/270537._SY475_.jpg,4.48,[],88.0,1.0,,,,98.0,1619.0,672,Vintage,"['1010', '430', '141', '28', '10']",,[],,['Dorothy Dunnett']

Gordon,,"['Erotica', 'Fiction', 'BDSM', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Banned Books', 'Czech Literature']","Originally written under a pseudonym, this thrilling novel of passion in post-World War II London was banned upon its publication in the late 1960s, and is only now being republished under the author's real name. Edith Templeton creates an indelible character in the smartly dressed Louisa, a savvy young woman in the midst of a divorce who meets a charismatic man in a pub and within an hour has been sexually conquered by him on a garden bench. Thus begins her baffling but magnetic love affair with, and virtual enslavement to, Richard Gordon.Gordon, a psychiatrist, keeps Louisa in his thrall with his almost omniscient ability to see through her and she, in turn, is gripped by the deep, unexpected pleasure of complete submission. As they venture further and further into the depths -- both psychological and sexual -- she begins, for the first time, to understand her troubled history and the self that has emerged from it.In her clean, precise style, with every social nuance and motive exquisitely observed, Templeton delivers a tightly wound drama, unsparingly forthright in its description of how this form of love can bring incomparable rapture. Louisa's unsettling story has more than the ring of truth to it: it is told with urgency and relish, and its outcome, which leaves Louisa enlightened and changed forever, is profoundly satisfying.",,,10/30/66,March 4th 2003,[],Hardcover,,9780375421945,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180978160l/1099660.jpg,3.39,[],95.0,1.0,,,,78.0,426.0,240,Pantheon,"['75', '138', '119', '66', '28']",,[],,['Edith Templeton']

Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'New York', 'American History', 'Cities', 'The United States Of America', 'Urban Studies', 'American', 'Historical', 'Reference']","To European explorers, it was Eden, a paradise of waist-high grasses, towering stands of walnut, maple, chestnut, and oak, and forests that teemed with bears, wolves, raccoons, beavers, otters, and foxes. Today, it is the site of Broadway and Wall Street, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and the home of millions of people, who have come from every corner of the nation and the globe.In Gotham, Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace have produced a monumental work of history, one that ranges from the Indian tribes that settled in and around the island of Manna-hata, to the consolidation of the five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898. It is an epic narrative, a story as vast and as varied as the city it chronicles, and it underscores that the history of New York is the story of our nation. Readers will relive the tumultuous early years of New Amsterdam under the Dutch West India Company, Peter Stuyvesant's despotic regime, Indian wars, slave resistance and revolt, the Revolutionary War and the defeat of Washington's army on Brooklyn Heights, the destructive seven years of British occupation, New York as the nation's first capital, the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the Erie Canal and the coming of the railroads, the growth of the city as a port and financial center, the infamous draft riots of the Civil War, the great flood of immigrants, the rise of mass entertainment such as vaudeville and Coney Island, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the birth of the skyscraper. Here too is a cast of thousands--the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Clement Moore, who saved Greenwich Village from the city's street-grid plan; Herman Melville, who painted disillusioned portraits of city life; and Walt Whitman, who happily celebrated that same life. We meet the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Boss Tweed and his nemesis, cartoonist Thomas Nast; Emma Goldman and Nellie Bly; Jacob Riis and Horace Greeley; police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt; Colonel Waring and his ""white angels"" (who revolutionized the sanitation department); millionaires John Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and William Randolph Hearst; and hundreds more who left their mark on this great city.The events and people who crowd these pages guarantee that this is no mere local history. It is in fact a portrait of the heart and soul of America, and a book that will mesmerize everyone interested in the peaks and valleys of American life as found in the greatest city on earth. Gotham is a dazzling read, a fast-paced, brilliant narrative that carries the reader along as it threads hundreds of stories into one great blockbuster of a book.",Gotham #1,,11/19/98,October 19th 2000,[],Paperback,,9780195140491,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924946l/217329.jpg,4.26,"['Pulitzer Prize for History (1999)', 'New York City Book Award for Book of the Year (1998)']",79.0,1.0,,,,96.0,2221.0,1408,"Oxford University Press, USA","['1074', '746', '319', '61', '21']",,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'New York State (United States)']",,"['Edwin G.

  Another nameless town, another target for First Recon. It's only five in the afternoon, but a sandtorm has plunged everything into a hellish twilight of murky, red dust. On rooftops, in alleyways lurk militiamen with machine guns, AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade. Artillery bombardment has shattered the town's sewers and rubble is piled up in lagoons of human excrement. It stinks. Welcome to Iraq...
Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam.

God's Tissues (From 100% Cerebral Palsy to 100% Realization & Fulfillment in Life),,[],"“Happiness and success are not just goals to reach: they are a way of living...” (Eyal Sabag)Eyal Sabag is one of the most sought-out coaches and motivational speakers in Israel. Here he provides a “hindsight” glimpse into his unbelievable life, revealing his story of transformation: from almost complete disability (caused by cerebral palsy at birth) to a lifetime of fulfillment and self-realization. As Eyal often advises, “if I can do it, so can you!”At the age of 24, after enduring years of self pity, needy reliance on others, insecurity, and a strong belief that his life is just a product of one case of very bad luck, Eyal found another way to live. On this new path, which he calls “From Disable to Able,” Eyal has learned how to use the seemingly magical power of the subconscious, positive thinking, and imagination; all of which opened the door to a brand new world: one in which he retook control over his choices and actions in life. Eyal now leads a life enriched by taking practical and responsible actions. He says he has never felt happier, stronger, or more whole. Through a deep inner perspective, enhanced by a light and humoristic approach to life in the face of hardships, in this book Eyal provides you with a set of practical tools that allow you to go from a “fixation state-of-mind” to spiritual, mental and physical prosperity and freedom. Ask yourself the following questions:Are you happy?Is there love in your life?Do you feel content with what you do?Are you satisfied with your employment situation?Do you just make ends meet each month?Are you appreciated where you work?Are you aware of the huge potential that lies within you?Do you believe that your future is predetermined and cannot be changed?This book is for you if you’re ready to change your mindset, and delve into new and exciting life’s adventures. The Hebrew version of Eyal’s book sold thousands of copies in Israel, and is finally brought to you in English. Mr. Sabag is an Adlerian coach and motivational speaker.

"God, the Evolver: A Secular Approach to the Divine",,[],"God The Evolver: A Secular Approach to the Divine Too Evolved To Believe In God? Discover The Spiritual Successor To ""The Origin Of Species."" Religion and science have been fighting an undeclared war for centuries. Ever since we stepped out of the dark ages and modern science started taking its first baby steps, people have been debating the connection between metaphysics and physics. And human evolution is one of the most controversial issues. Until now. This eye- opening book will offer you an in-depth understanding of evolution from a religio-scientific point of view. God The Evolver - Bridging The Gap Between Metaphysics & Science! If you are a serious free thinker without any religious or scientific prejudices, then this book is for you. If you are not afraid to step into spiritual no-man's land and test your knowledge, then this book will offer you a game-changing perspective. By combining religion, philosophy and science, author Faiz King has created a comprehensive guide to the struggle of religion and science. What Makes The Human Mind So Special? Back To Metaphysics. By the end of this book you will be able to understand the debate and realize that higher-order religious processes (e.g. Metaphysics) are necessary to realize the full extent of the rational and abstract properties of our human mind. And that's exactly what sets us apart from the rest of the creatures that live on this planet. God's Plan - How To Understand Centuries Of Evolution. After over 20 years of meticulous research, Faiz King has created the definitive successor to Charles Darwin's ""The Origin Of Species"" that is not afraid to take on this science giant and prove that Metaphysics (and subsequently God) is behind the development of modern science as we know it.

De mindkettőben főtulajdonság: a bölcs derű és a finomság, a szatíra náluk inkább csak pikáns árnyalat!A legújabb magyar újság-croquis-k erős fordulatot mutatnak: a bölcs mosolyból kegyetlen grimasz lett. Már Molnár Ferenc croquis-cikkei is ezt a fordulatot éreztetik, de legteljesebben Karinthy Frigyes szokatlan merészségű és erejű ilynemű művei rajzolják elénk az új magyar croquis képét. Molnárnál még némi bujkáló líra enyhíti olykor a maró viccet, Karinthynál teljes fölényével és kegyetlenségével lép elő a szatíra. Croquis-cikkei olvasásakor fantasztikus, már-már félelmes méretekig lendülő cirkuszi bohóc víziója elevenedik elém, egy krétás arcú vigyorgóé, aki pofonokat oszt, fejeket tép le, amiket fordítva, eltorzítva ragaszt vissza, s olykor a csillagokig nyúl, hogy azokkal mutasson be groteszk és döbbenetes tréfákat.Karinthy szokatlan sikerének kétségkívül az a titka, hogy bár kegyetlen s bár igen gyakran a croquis szerény korlátain szinte brutális erővel veti túl magát heves lendülete, mindvégig kacagtató tud maradni. A mulattató helyzetek variálásában, a nevettető torzítás biztosságában elsőrangú, s a croquis-nyelv kezelésében szinte páratlan. A furcsa, alakuló budapesti nyelv bravúros kezelője, s akárhányszor avatott továbbfejlesztője is. Némely fordulata, egy-egy alakjának neve szájról szájra száll, s olyanok szókincsébe is beiktatódik, akik talán nem is olvasták croquis-jait.Karinthy szatirikus cikkei - melyek közül legújabb kötetében, a Grimasz címűben, talán a legjellegzetesebbeket gyűjtötte össze - a maguk módján pompás kifejezői napjaink szellemének, az író kitűnő hivatottságát mi sem mutatja jobban, minthogy ez a kifejezőerő egy jelentéktelenebb műfaj keretében is oly dúsan adatott meg neki.",,,,2011,[],ebook,,9789630970037,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447937818l/27859952._SX318_.jpg,3.75,[],96.0,1.0,,,,88.0,8.0,,Kossuth Kiadó,"['2', '3', '2', '1', '0']",,[],,['Frigyes Karinthy']

This book delivers hope and redemption in the face of the tragic shooting, and introduces two unforgettable heroes.AS INDIVIDUALS, CONGRESSWOMAN GABRIELLE GIFFORDS and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, showed Americans how optimism, an adventurous spirit, and a call to service can help change the world. As a couple, they became a national example of the healing power to be found in deeply shared love and courage. Their arrival in the world spotlight came under the worst of circumstances. On January 8, 2011, while meeting with her constituents in Tucson, Arizona, Gabby was the victim of an assassination attempt that left six people dead and thirteen wounded. Gabby was shot in the head; doctors called her survival “miraculous.” As the nation grieved and sought to understand the attack, Gabby remained in private, focused on her against-all-odds recovery. Mark spent every possible moment by her side, as he also prepared for his final mission as commander of space shuttle Endeavour. Now, as Gabby’s health continues to improve, the couple is sharing their remarkable untold story. Intimate, inspiring, and unforgettably moving, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope provides an unflinching look at the overwhelming challenges of brain injury, the painstaking process of learning to communicate again, and the responsibilities that fall to a loving spouse who wants the best possible treatment for his wife. Told in Mark’s voice and from Gabby’s heart, the book also chronicles the lives that brought these two extraordinary people together—their humor, their ambitions, their sense of duty, their long-distance marriage, and their desire for family. Gabby and Mark made a pledge to tell their account as honestly as possible, and they have done so in riveting detail. Both Gabby and Mark have lived large public lives, but this book takes readers behind many closed doors—from the flight deck of the space shuttle to the cloakrooms of Congress to the hospital wards where Gabby struggled to reclaim herself with the help of formidable medical teams and devoted family and friends. Questions are answered with unvarnished candor. How do Gabby and Mark feel about the angry political discourse that was swirling in America at the time of the shooting, and that remains prevalent today? How do they see government living up to the highest possible ideals? And how do they understand and mourn the loss of the people who did not survive that day? Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope is a reminder of the power of true grit, the patience needed to overcome unimaginable obstacles, and the transcendence of love. In the story of Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly, we all can see the best in ourselves.

"Garry Kasparov on Fischer: My Great Predecessors, Part IV",,"['Chess', 'Games', 'Nonfiction']","This book brings together the two greatest names in the history of chess. The author, Garry Kasparov, is the world number one, and by common consent, the greatest player ever. The subject of the book, Bobby Fischer, is the only American to have become world champion and is probably the greatest natural talent the world has ever seen.In the period between 1955 and 1972, Fischer, more or less single-handedly, took on the might of the Soviet Chess Empire and won. During this time Fischer scored astonishing successes, the likes of which had not been seen before. These included 11/11 in the 1963/64 U.S. Championship and match victories (en route to the World Championship) by the score of 6-0 against two of the strongest players in the world, Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen. The climax of Fischer's campaign was his unforgettable match win in Reykjavik in 1972 against Boris Spassky.However, Fischer is not only remembered for his achievements over-the-board, he is almost equally well-known for his temperamental behavior away from the board. He made extreme demands of all those around him, including tournament organizers. When these demands were not met he often refused to play. The 1972 match against Spassky required the intervention of no less than Henry Kissinger to smooth things over. In 1975, when he was due to defend his title against Anatoly Karpov, Fischer was completely unable to agree terms with FIDE (the World Chess Federation) and was defaulted. After this, he more or less gave up chess, playing only once, a ""return"" match against Spassky in 1992.In this book, a must for all serious chess players, Kasparov deeply analyzes Fischer's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great American genius.",My Great Predecessors #4,,,January 1st 2005,[],Hardcover,,9781857443950,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389215488l/370243.jpg,4.4,['English Chess Federation Book of the Year (2005)'],89.0,1.0,,,,98.0,213.0,496,Everyman Chess,"['116', '72', '21', '3', '1']",,[],,"['Garry Kasparov', 'Dmitry Plisetsky', 'Kenneth P.

"Good Calories, Bad Calories",,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Nutrition', 'Science', 'Fitness', 'Diets', 'Cooking', 'Medicine', 'Self Help']","Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight, and DiseaseIn this groundbreaking book, the result of seven years of research in every science connected with the impact of nutrition on health, award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less and exercising more. Yet with more and more people acting on this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates (white flour, sugar, easily digested starches) and sugars–via their dramatic and longterm effects on insulin, the hormone that regulates fat accumulation–and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. There are good calories, and bad ones.Good CaloriesThese are from foods without easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. These foods can be eaten without restraint.Meat, fish, fowl, cheese, eggs, butter, and non-starchy vegetables. Bad CaloriesThese are from foods that stimulate excessive insulin secretion and so make us fat and increase our risk of chronic disease—all refined and easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. The key is not how much vitamins and minerals they contain, but how quickly they are digested. (So apple juice or even green vegetable juices are not necessarily any healthier than soda.) Bread and other baked goods, potatoes, yams, rice, pasta, cereal grains, corn, sugar (sucrose and high fructose corn syrup), ice cream, candy, soft drinks, fruit juices, bananas and other tropical fruits, and beer. Taubes traces how the common assumption that carbohydrates are fattening was abandoned in the 1960s when fat and cholesterol were blamed for heart disease and then –wrongly–were seen as the causes of a host of other maladies, including cancer. He shows us how these unproven hypotheses were emphatically embraced by authorities in nutrition, public health, and clinical medicine, in spite of how well-conceived clinical trials have consistently refuted them. He also documents the dietary trials of carbohydrate-restriction, which consistently show that the fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. With precise references to the most significant existing clinical studies, he convinces us that there is no compelling scientific evidence demonstrating that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease, that salt causes high blood pressure, and that fiber is a necessary part of a healthy diet. Based on the evidence that does exist, he leads us to conclude that the only healthy way to lose weight and remain lean is to eat fewer carbohydrates or to change the type of the carbohydrates we do eat, and, for some of us, perhaps to eat virtually none at all.The 11 Critical Conclusions of Good Calories, Bad Calories: 1. Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, does not cause heart disease. 2. Carbohydrates do, because of their effect on the hormone insulin. The more easily-digestible and refined the carbohydrates and the more fructose they contain, the greater the effect on our health, weight, and well-being. 3. Sugars—sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup specifically—are particularly harmful. The glucose in these sugars raises insulin levels; the fructose they contain overloads the liver.4. Refined carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are also the most likely dietary causes of cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, and the other common chronic diseases of modern times. 5. Obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation, not overeating and not sedentary behavior. 6. Consuming excess calories does not cause us to grow fatter any more than it causes a child to grow taller. 7. Exercise does not make us lose excess fat; it makes us hungry. 8. We get fat because of an imbalance—a disequilibrium—in the hormonal regulation of fat tissue and fat metabolism. More fat is stored in the fat tissue than is mobilized and used for fuel. We become leaner when the hormonal regulation of the fat tissue reverses this imbalance. 9. Insulin is the primary regulator of fat storage. When insulin levels are elevated, we stockpile calories as fat. When insulin levels fall, we release fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel. 10. By stimulating insulin secretion, carbohydrates make us fat and ultimately cause obesity. By driving fat accumulation, carbohydrates also increase hunger and decrease the amount of energy we expend in metabolism and physical activity.11. The fewer carbohydrates we eat, the leaner we will be. Good Calories, Bad Calories is a tour de force of scientific investigation–certain to redefine the ongoing debate about the foods we eat and their effects on our health.From the Hardcover edition.",,,08/05/04,September 23rd 2008,[],Paperback,,9781400033461,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348003139l/2442529.jpg,4.18,[],97.0,1.0,,,,94.0,8833.0,634,Anchor,"['4187', '2745', '1344', '385', '172']",,[],,['Gary Taubes']

This principle that we vaguely apply to our lives and our work is actually the key to Christian ethics, to influencing our culture for Christ, and to infusing our ordinary, everyday lives with the presence of God. For when we realize that the ""mundane"" activities that consume most of our time are ""God's hiding places,"" our perspective changes.Culture expert Gene Veith unpacks the biblical, Reformation teaching about the doctrine of vocation, emphasizing not what we should specifically do with our time or what careers we are called to, but what God does in and through our callings—even within the home.

Klimt's unfading popularity attests to the appeal of not only his aesthetic sensibilities but also that of the recurrent universal themes in his work: love, feminine beauty, aging, and death.

Taking the form of an “oral” history, this books contains over 130 interviews, along with essential background information from acclaimed music writer Greg Prato. The early ’90s grunge movement may have last only a few years, but it spawned some of the greatest rock music of all time: Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden. This book contains the first-ever interview in which Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder was willing to discuss the group’s history in great detail; Alice in Chains’ band members and Layne Staley’s mom on Staley’s drug addiction and death; insights into the Riot Grrrl movement and oft-overlooked but highly influential Seattle bands like Mother Love Bone/Andy Wood, the Melvins, Screaming Trees, and Mudhoney; and much more. Grunge Is Dead digs deeper than the average grunge history, starting in the early '60s, and explaining the chain of events that gave way to the grunge movement.

Glory and Honor: The Music and Artistic Legacy of Johann Sebastian Bach,,"['Biography', 'Music']","Johann Sebastian Bach was a musical genius, an intellectual giant, and a gracious man. His achievement in the area of music is one of the greatest tours de force in history-on a par with or surpassing that of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Dante, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Milton, Aristotle, Augustine, or Aquinas. Even more compelling is the fact that Bach intentionally wrote all of his music from a Christian perspective and for the glory of God. Bach worked at a crucial time in history. He combated the ideas of the Enlightenment with its elevation of human reason as the ultimate authority of everything. His struggles, musically and professionally, are those of a man seeking to maintain a high view of worship, academics, and the grounding of all life on the Word of God. As a man valiant in his convictions, he stood against the trends and fashions of his day and succeeded as a witness of the gospel to the generations who followed him. Although orphaned at an early age, Bach grew up surrounded by a life of music and quickly distinguished himself as an avid learner and apt pupil. The majority of his career was as the cantor of Leipzig-a position that required him to teach school and provide music for the town's churches every week. During this period he wrote a tremendous amount of music and fought against Enlightenment ideas that sought to undermine church worship. And while his name conjures many images, musical phrases, and half-remembered stories, the life of this colossal genius provides practical lessons in leadership for both artists and anyone who strives to serve others with excellence and integrity.",Leaders in Action,,,November 1st 2005,[],Hardcover,,9781581824704,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388454655l/1387399.jpg,4.03,[],52.0,1.0,,,,97.0,35.0,260,Cumberland House Publishing,"['13', '11', '10', '1', '0']",,[],,['Gregory Wilbur']

Go Set a Watchman,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels']","From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch—""Scout""—returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past—a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision—a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.

"Goodnight, and Thanks for the Vodka [2002]",,"['Psychology', 'Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Abuse']"," A book of Raw Emotion!    In Harpie’s wacky, psycho, screwball, demented book she bares her soul, revealing her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the page   Harpie’s deepest and most intimate feelings gush from her, revealing anxieties ranging from her feelings for her mother, who died in tragic and suspicious circumstances, to her resentment towards her father. And then there were others who abused her physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually. All this is tied up and interwoven with her love of her young son, Mike.  Harpie has memories buried deep in shadowy parts of her subconscious that she’s never been able to reach. They include the mystery surrounding her mother’s murder. With the help of a clinical psychologist and regressive hypnotism, she revisits the past as she dips in and out of Now and Then.  In 'Vodka' Harpie uncovers the missing parts her lost childhood.  More than a modern-day and quirky diary, this is the story of one woman’s life in a typical English small town, encompassing the characters, texture and mentality of everyday living, told with brutal and shameless honesty while all the while cross-threading with a struggle for survival and acceptance.  This is no jump on the bandwagon 'pity me' story, as the vein of humour running through every chapter is testament. Harpie’s goal in writing ‘Vodka’ is to prove to the cynics that it can be done. She can write her truth and miss nothing out – heart attacks, miscarriages, beatings, blood gushing, sex, poverty, mayhem, men and vodka - and always with that beautiful self-deprecating sense of humour common to the British.  After suffering a miscarriage, followed by a heart attack and having stopped breathing in intensive care she signs herself out of the hospital, clothing caked in dried blood, because there’s nobody at home to see to the animals. The following day Harpie berates herself for just sitting about moping all day on the sofa, so scrubs herself up and goes down the pub. The next day she walks four miles to the hospital to pick her car up, reasoning that “the walk might do me some good.” You can’t help but admire and applaud her efforts to keep her life on track, staying in work and as a single mum ensuring her child has a safe home life.  This book began as a social experiment in honesty after a debate among authors about how honest it's possible to be. Harpie set out to prove that everything can be written, the good, the bad and the shameful. There is nowhere that this woman won’t go. If there’s a line to cross, Harpie will stick out her chest and limbo under it, jump over it or dance through it with a glass of vodka in her hand while never spilling a drop.   This is a book of raw emotion …. And it bleeds   KW ",,,,April 24th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,B00WNO57HW,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442216888l/25547711._SY475_.jpg,4.34,[],93.0,1.0,,,,91.0,116.0,582,Karl Wiggins,"['76', '18', '12', '6', '4']",,[],,"['Harpie', 'Karl Wiggins']"

Ghosts is a scathing indictment of Victorian society in which Ibsen refutes the notion that if one simply fulfills one's duty rather than following one's desires then a good and noble life will be achieved. Scandalous in its day for its frank discussion of venereal disease and marriage infidelity, Ghosts remains to this day an intense psychological drama and sharp social criticism.Ghosts was written during the autumn of 1881 and was published in December of the same year. It was not performed in the theatre until May 1882, when a Danish touring company produced it in the Aurora Turner Hall in Chicago.

What binds the four of them is the friendship formed by the scheme, their school, and their ambition to escape from both; their loyalty fused in street morality: back up your mates, don't hit women and, most importantly, never grass - on anyone.

Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,,"['Business', 'Leadership', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Buisness', 'Management', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Audiobook', 'Finance']","To find the keys to greatness, Collins's 21-person research team read and coded 6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.The ChallengeBuilt to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The StudyFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The StandardsUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. The ComparisonsThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? The FindingsThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results.

Headstrong and proud, with her roots stuck deep in Calder soil, she always knew that Ty Calder was the man for her, even if she had to wait for him to leave behind his loveless marriage to glamorous, poor little rich girl, Tara. Now, as Ty‘s wife, Jessy finally has everything she‘s ever wanted—the strong bonds of family, a thriving ranch, and the long-awaited promise of a new life growing within her…proof of her love for Ty. And then Tara returns. As manipulative as she is beautiful, Tara has never brought anything with her but trouble, and Jessy can only wonder what she wants this time. But when Tara‘s powerful father dies, she seems genuinely shattered and leans on Ty and his sister, Cat, for comfort and strength. Soon, Tara‘s back on the land and in their lives, and nothing is the same. As days give way to months, Tara‘s very presence divides the ranch, replacing long-held bonds of trust between employer and employees, friends and relatives—husband and wife—with new seeds of suspicion and simmering jealousies that endanger Jessy‘s happiness and the Calder‘s claim on their land.

Growing Up bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Islam', 'War', 'Cultural']","As the western world’s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden has fought to keep his personal life a mystery – loyalty and fear keeping those who know him from speaking out – until now.For the first time, two of Osama’s closest family members, his first wife Najwa and their fourth son Omar, go behind the headlines to reveal the truth about the character and life of a man feared and revered around the globe. In gripping detail, they recount the drama, tensions, and everyday activities of the man they knew as a husband and father. Married at fifteen, Najwa describes the transformation of the quiet, serious young man she fell in love with into an authoritarian husband and stern father, an entrepreneur, and – finally – the leader of a complex international terrorist network. Uprooted from a life of extraordinary luxury and privilege in Saudi Arabia, they suddenly found themselves living life on the run, fleeing from country to country under assumed names and fake passports. Omar describes how he and his siblings were brought up in remote ranches and fortified Afghani mountain camps, handling Kalashnikovs and learning desert survival skills. Their eventual escape from Afghanistan would come just days before the terrible events of 9/11 changed the world forever.

Great Moments in Aviation & Oranges are Not the Only Fruit: Two Filmscripts,,[],"Gabriel Angel is on board a ship and heading for England. This young black woman has a small amount of luggage, but a large amount of courage: ""You've got to risk the best you've got if you want a little bit of life."" Gabriel has left her home in the Caribbean for the opportunity to spread her wings, but for the moment she is enclosed on a ship out in the middle of the ocean. In this film script Winterson characters are limited by location, but their emotional lives are given free reign.  Winterson concentrates on five passengers, Gabriel, who's grand-father was a ""magician, and a entertainer, a man of the air""; Duncan Stewart, a handsome, mysterious photographer; Rex Goodyear, an art dealer in his 50s, and two missionary women, Doctor Bead and Miss Quim. Each person has a secret, a hidden past or motivation, which gradually begins to effect all of the others as the seven-day voyage continues. The ship becomes a floating vessel of stories, a love story, a mystery story, a drama of revenge and redemption.  Familiar Winterson themes are explored here: the transformation of the ordinary work-a-day world into something vibrant and magical; the quest for beauty and truth, the workings of the heart. But what is sometimes missing is the sheer joy of language. Winterson's novels are as much about the glory of words, as the interest of a story, here the prose is more pared down, stripped away. The mind's eye has to work as a camera, filling in light and texture and image and this makes for a challenging read.

Gut Symmetries,,"['Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Lesbian', 'Adult Fiction']","Physics seems to have become the new language of love in the 1990s, and Jeanette Winterson is not the first writer to make a major character a physicist. Jonathan Lethem mined similar territory earlier this year in his delightful book, As She Climbed Across the Table, and now Winterson enters the lists with not one, but two physicists populating the pages of her equally wonderful book, Gut Symmetries. If you think about it, physics does make a good metaphor for love, encompassing as it does the principles of attraction, the exchange of energy, and unification. At the center of this meditation on ""the intelligence of the universe"" and ""the stupidity of humankind"" are Jove, a married physicist; Alice, a single physicist who becomes his mistress; and Stella, Jove's wife and later, Alice's lover. They meet on the QE2 and from there the three participants in the story take turns telling their versions of it.  Gut Symmetries is a collage of memories, snippets of scientific theory, meditations on abstract concepts like truth, and the events surrounding Jove, Alice, and Stella's affair. This is a book that demands your attention, jumping as it does from one seemingly tangential topic to another; but whereas physics still seeks a grand unification theory (GUT) to explain how everything in the universe fits together, Winterson actually finds one of her own in this satisfyingly complete fictional world.",,,,March 25th 1997,['Jupiter (God)'],Hardcover,,9780517286937,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446104345l/15056.jpg,3.8,['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (1997)'],229.0,3.0,,,,91.0,4401.0,219,Random House Value Publishing,"['1210', '1602', '1183', '313', '93']",,[],,['Jeanette Winterson']

Galen's acute diagnoses of patients, his botanical wisdom and studies of physiology were recorded in numerous books, handed down through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. He developed sports medicine, doctoring gladiators. Not least, Galen passed on the medical tradition of respect for life.

"Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde",,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Crime', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', '20th Century']","Forget everything you think you know about Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. Previous books and films, including the brilliant 1967 movie starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, have emphasized the supposed glamour of America's most notorious criminal couple, thus contributing to ongoing mythology. The real story is completely different -- and far more fascinating.In Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, bestselling author Jeff Guinn combines exhaustive research with surprising, newly discovered material to tell the real tale of two kids from a filthy Dallas slum who fell in love and then willingly traded their lives for a brief interlude of excitement and, more important, fame. Their timing could not have been better -- the Barrow Gang pulled its first heist in 1932 when most Americans, reeling from the Great Depression, were desperate for escapist entertainment. Thanks to newsreels, true crime magazines, and new-fangled wire services that transmitted scandalous photos of Bonnie smoking a cigar to every newspaper in the nation, the Barrow Gang members almost instantly became household names on a par with Charles Lindbergh, Jack Dempsey, and Babe Ruth. In the minds of the public, they were cool, calculating bandits who robbed banks and killed cops with equal impunity.Nothing could have been further from the truth. Clyde and Bonnie were perhaps the most inept crooks ever, and their two-year crime spree was as much a reign of error as it was of terror. Lacking the sophistication to plot robberies of big-city banks, the Barrow Gang preyed mostly on small mom-and-pop groceries and service stations. Even at that, they often came up empty-handed and were reduced to breaking into gum machines for meal money. Both were crippled, Clyde from cutting off two of his toes while in prison and Bonnie from a terrible car crash caused by Clyde's reckless driving. Constantly on the run from the law, they lived like animals, camping out in their latest stolen car, bathing in creeks, and dining on cans of cold beans and Vienna sausages. Yet theirs was a genuine love story. Their devotion to each other was as real as their overblown reputation as criminal masterminds was not.Go Down Together has it all -- true romance, rebellion against authority, bullets flying, cars crashing, and, in the end, a dramatic death at the hands of a celebrity lawman hired to hunt them down. Thanks in great part to surviving Barrow and Parker family members and collectors of criminal memorabilia who provided Jeff Guinn with access to never-before-published material, we finally have the real story of Bonnie and Clyde and their troubled times, delivered with cinematic sweep and unprecedented insight by a masterful storyteller.",,,03/10/08,March 10th 2009,"['Bonnie Parker', 'Clyde Barrow']",Hardcover,,9781416557067,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348629462l/4858915.jpg,4.17,['Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (2010)'],117.0,2.0,,,,97.0,3571.0,468,Simon & Schuster,"['1428', '1450', '577', '91', '25']",,[],,"['Jeff Guinn', 'Jonathan Hogan']"

Now, in Gone for Soldiers, Jeff Shaara carries us back fifteen years before that momentous conflict, when the Civil War's most familiar names are fighting for another cause, junior officers marching under the same flag in an unfamiliar land, experiencing combat for the first time in the Mexican-American War.In March 1847, the U.S. Navy delivers eight thousand soldiers on the beaches of Vera Cruz. They are led by the army's commanding general, Winfield Scott, a heroic veteran of the War of 1812, short tempered, vain, and nostalgic for the glories of his youth. At his right hand is Robert E. Lee, a forty-year-old engineer, a dignified, serious man who has never seen combat.Scott leads his troops against the imperious Mexican dictator, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. Obsessed with glory and his place in history, Santa Ana arrogantly underestimates the will and the heart of Scott and his army. As the Americans fight their way inland, both sides understand that the inevitable final conflict will come at the gates and fortified walls of the ancient capital, Mexico City.Cut off from communication and their only supply line, the Americans learn about their enemy and themselves, as young men witness for the first time the horror of war. While Scott must weigh his own place in history, fighting what many consider a bully's war, Lee the engineer becomes Lee the hero, the one man in Scott's command whose extraordinary destiny as a soldier is clear.In vivid, brilliant prose that illuminates the dark psychology of soldiers and their commanders trapped behind enemy lines, Jeff Shaara brings to life the haunted personalities and magnificent backdrop, the familiar characters, the stunning triumphs and soul-crushing defeats of this fascinating, long-forgotten war. Gone for Soldiers is an extraordinary achievement that will remain with you long after the final page is turned.From the Hardcover edition.",,,05/02/00,November 4th 2003,[],Paperback,,9780345427526,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388869164l/56331.jpg,4.14,[],180.0,2.0,,,,97.0,4898.0,512,Ballantine Books,"['1828', '2063', '875', '107', '25']",,[],,['Jeff Shaara']

You’ll almost smell the omnipresent whiff of cheap wine, and feel the dirty lino under your feet.Read the true life adventures of an English lad as he struggles to make a living amongst ‘gangstas’ who are arguably the most violent in the United States.For anyone who has puked in the back of a cab, then argued over the fare at 3am, this book is your driver’s revenge. I’ve done my best to create a ‘living poem’ that is by turns thoughtful and brutal, but very funny.People have always told me I’m a natural storyteller, but like every good cab driver I have an opinion on a range of hot issues, from the congestion charge to Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam. You’ll be able to hear my characters, see them and, in some instances, actually smell them. They’ll leave their stain on you. You may well be able to relate to guys who used their fists and their wits, you may laugh at their humour and get their jokes, but it’ll be the thugs with guns and no soul who will unsettle you. I want you to be scared of them.",,,04/28/04,January 13th 2013,[],Kindle Edition,,B00B0QMZ42,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378469164l/18461055.jpg,4.31,[],663.0,7.0,,,,91.0,220.0,177,Amazon Digital Services,"['144', '31', '26', '8', '11']",,[],,['Karl Wiggins']
Gunpowder Soup,,[],"Although there are a lot of football stories in this book, it isn't all about visits to away grounds (Millwall, Arsenal, Tottenham, West Ham, Leicester, Liverpool etc.) and other football-related essays. I also talk about home games against Stoke, Chelsea and Man U for instanceMy diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That’s all.But although I’m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein – in ‘Gunpowder Soup’ I also touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people.I’ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough – and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial.Right now the planet is spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we’re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people.So why the title ‘Gunpowder Soup’? Well, although my last book was entitled ‘100 Common Sense Policies to make BRITAIN GREAT again’ the book before that, ‘Nobody Asked Me, But …’, showed a rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. ‘Rabbit & Pork,’ of course, is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I’ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively – mostly at parties, and generally by my wife. So why a tin of soup? And why in particular Gunpowder Soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences – family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives. All these ‘ingredients’ make up our Soup of Life.Now, when making a soup, once you’ve added an ingredient, it’s forever blended in and you can’t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever.So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it’ll always be part and parcel of your ‘soup.’ And as you add more ingredients the ‘recipe’ of your life evolves, and before you know it you can’t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it’s still there at a deep subliminal level. Remember that.Some people may not add hatred until they’re in their twenties, and most of us never add it at all. And you can never entirely erase the flavour of a particular spice in soup. That’s the metaphorical significance of a tin of soup, but since writing ‘Nobody’ it’s becoming abundantly clear that we’re facing greater challenges, and if we’re not very, very careful the country as we know it - these ‘pleasant pastures green’ - are set to implode! What else can I say? I write like a finger up your bum. I’m either a pleasant surprise or I make everything awkward and uncomfortable. I’m strong-willed, a bit outspoken and I write exactly what I’m thinking. I’m not to everyone’s taste, but I have a good sense of humour, a dirty mind and an honest heart.",,,,May 7th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,,B07CXJJG3L,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525991019l/40097776._SY475_.jpg,4.83,[],88.0,1.0,,,,100.0,12.0,,Karl Wiggins,"['10', '2', '0', '0', '0']",,[],,['Karl Wiggins']

Grosvenor Square,,[],"Untitled Document An engaging, romantic, provocative homage to the 19th-century novel. Amid the genteel charms of 19th-century London's elegant Mayfair district, the Hathaways take up residence in Grosvenor Square. With an increasing fortune, refined upbringing, and fashionable social circle, the close-knit family seems assured of a bright and comfortable future. But their idyllic world is disrupted by the arrival of Jasper Munroe, a distant relation who touches off a series of unsettling events that will change their lives forever. The Hathaway siblings - spirited Lorna, gentle Tom, and beautiful Rosamond - are led down divergent paths of self-discovery, both virtuous and destructive, as each learns about love, loss, and the price of preserving the ties that bind. In a story of beauty and philosophy, romance and heartache, betrayal and redemption, Grosvenor Square explores the intricacies of human relationships and raises significant questions about the extent to which lives are shaped not only by individual choice, but just as compellingly, by the influence of others. Stylistically reflective of the Victorian novelists to whom it pays tribute, Grosvenor Square reveals a poignant narrative embedded with a relevant social commentary.""Seamlessly blending 19th-century history with captivating storytelling, Katherine Ann Meyer has created an engaging story written with vivid detail and authenticity.

There's something oddly familiar about this ghost cat--it does lots of things that remind the boy of the cat he used to have.

When he purchased four acres of land on Vashon Island, he was looking for an affordable home a ferry ride away from the restaurants he ran in Seattle. But as he continued to serve his customers frozen chicken breasts and packaged pork, he became aware of the connection between what he ate and where it came from: a hive of bees provided honey; a young cow could give fresh milk; an apple orchard allowed him to make vinegar. Told in Timmermeister's plainspoken voice, Growing a Farmer details with honesty the initial stumbles and subsequent realities he had to face in his quest to establish a profitable farm for himself.

Rosewater, seeking to put his inheritance to some meaningful use (his father was an entrepreneur), tries to do good within the context of almost illimitable cynicism and corruption.It is in this novel that Rosewater wanders into a science fiction conference--an actual annual event in Milford, Pennsylvania--and at the motel delivers his famous monologue evoked by science fiction writers and critics for almost half a century: ""None of you can write for sour apples... but you're the only people trying to come to terms with the really terrific things which are happening today."" Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition. The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical. The novel is told mostly thru a collection of short stories dealing with Eliot's interactions with the citizens of Rosewater County, usually with the last sentence serving as a punch line. The antagonist's tale, Mushari's, is told in a similar short essay fashion.

Meanwhile, Holmes is pulled by two old friends and a distant relation into the growing war between France, Spain, and the Rif Revolt led by Emir Abd el-Krim--who may be a Robin Hood or a power mad tribesman.

"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief",,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Cults', 'Biography', 'Journalism', 'Psychology', 'True Crime', 'Sociology']","A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the now-classic study of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack, the Looming Tower. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast, secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.At the book's center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor, David Miscavige--tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.We learn about Scientology's esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee's state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom, through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org, the church's clergy, whose members often enter as children, signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women ""disconnected"" from friends and family by the church's policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover, through many firsthand stories, the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.In Going Clear, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations, understanding, and synthesis, and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposé and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.",,First Edition,,January 17th 2013,['L.

Guardian of Time,,"['Thriller', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Paranormal']","It’s the near future, and society is government controlled. Technology tracks everyone, personal privacy does not exist, and even food supplies are being monitored. The hope for freedom lies in the operations of an underground organization, GOG, which fights against worldwide oppression. Their most powerful weapon is Ann Torgeson, a paranormally-gifted operative, who unseals The Prophecies with her powers. With the government doggedly pursuing her, she goes underground, fleeing the Pacific Northwest, but not before leaving three murders, one suicide, and an explosion behind her. Will she and her companions survive to change the world after everything twists and turns upside down?The Prophecies series you're reading, or deciding whether you should read, was born just after the author survived a near-crash in a passenger jet.

And that is the incredible power of grit, perseverance, perspiration, determination, and sheer stick-to-it-tiveness. We are all dazzled by the notion that there are some people who get ahead, who reach the corner office because they are simply gifted, or well-connected, or both. But research shows that we far overvalue talent and intellectual ability in our culture. The fact is, so many people get ahead--even the gifted ones--because they worked incredibly hard, put in the thousands of hours of practice and extra sweat equity, and made their own luck. And Linda and Robin should know--they are two girls from the Bronx who had no special advantages or privileges and rose up through their own hard work and relentless drive to succeed to the top of their highly competitive profession. In a book illustrated with a cornucopia of stories and the latest research on success, the authors reveal the strategies that helped them, and countless others, succeed at the highest levels in their careers and professions, and in their personal lives. They talk about the guts--the courage--necessary to take on tough challenges and not give up at the first sign of difficulty. They discuss the essential quality of resiliency. Everyone suffers setbacks in their careers and in life. The key, however, is to pick yourself up and bounce back. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology, they discuss why optimists do better in school, work, and on the playing field--and how to reset that optimistic set point. They talk about industriousness, the notion that Malcolm Gladwell popularized with the 10,000-hour rule in his book Outliers. Creativity theorist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes it takes a minimum of 10 years for one's true creative potential to be realized. And the authors explore the concept of tenacity--the quality that allows us to remain focused and avoid distraction in order to get the job done--an increasingly difficult task in today's fragmented, cluttered, high-tech, connected world.Written in the same short, concise format as The Power of Nice and leavened with the natural humor that characterizes Linda's and Robin's lives--and books--Grit to Great is destined to be the book everyone in business needs.",,,01/20/15,September 8th 2015,[],Hardcover,,9780804139120,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434560773l/22173461._SY475_.jpg,3.64,[],97.0,1.0,,,,87.0,695.0,160,Crown Business,"['153', '237', '218', '74', '13']",,[],,"['Linda Kaplan Thaler', 'Robin Koval']"

The hero, the semi-autobiographical Ferdinand, moves through the nightmare of London's underworld during the years of World War I. In this distressing setting, he meets pimps and prostitutes, pawnbrokers and magicians, policemen and arsonists. He sees social and physiological decomposition as these processes unfold along parallel lines of development. The illusions of existence are nakedly exposed. The narrative erupts in Céline's characteristic elliptical style. His splintered sentences and scatology reflect his fury at the fragmentation of experience and at his own impotence in the face of it. Out of his rage, he forces the meaninglessness back on itself, and the exuberance of his struggle triumphs in the comic exaggeration of satire. Ultimately, his subject is not death but life, and he responds to it by a strengthened commitment to the sensual and concrete. His hallucinatory world is so vividly realized that it does, indeed, challenge the reality of the reader's more conventional world.",Guignol's Band #1,,April 1944,January 17th 1969,[],Paperback,,9780811200189,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347263374l/226954.jpg,3.75,[],18.0,1.0,,,,89.0,973.0,284,New Directions,"['251', '358', '261', '74', '29']",,"['London, England']",,"['Louis-Ferdinand Céline', 'Bernard Frechtman', 'Jack T.

Gilead,,Fiction,"A NOVEL THAT READERS and critics have been eagerly anticipating for over a decade, Gilead is an astonishingly imagined story of remarkable lives. John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It’s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames’s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family’s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather’s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend’s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames’s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life’s details, Gilead is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.",,,,2004.0,,,0002005883,9780002005883,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KQZCPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.85,,,,,,,,,247.0,,,361.0,,,['Marilynne Robinson']

Unrestricted by parental control and blessed with bright blond hair that signified good luck to the Chinese, he had free access to hidden corners of the colony normally closed to a Gweilo, a 'pale fellow' like him. Befriending rickshaw coolies and local stallholders, he learnt Cantonese, sampled delicacies such as boiled water beetles and one-hundred-year-old eggs, and participated in colourful festivals. He even entered the forbidden Kowloon Walled City, wandered into the secret lair of the Triads and visited an opium den. Along the way he encountered a colourful array of people, from the plink plonk man with his dancing monkey to Nagasaki Jim, a drunken child molester, and the Queen of Kowloon, the crazed tramp who may have been a member of the Romanov family.Shadowed by the unhappiness of his warring parents, a broad-minded mother who, like her son, was keen to embrace all things Chinese, and a bigoted father who was enraged by his family's interest in 'going native', Martin Booth's compelling memoir is a journey into Chinese culture and an extinct colonial way of life that glows with infectious curiosity and humour.",,,08/02/04,August 1st 2005,[],Paperback,,9780553816723,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374215963l/719600.jpg,4.15,[],194.0,2.0,,,,96.0,1601.0,384,Bantam,"['633', '656', '241', '59', '12']",,['Hong Kong'],,['Martin Booth']

The alimentary canal is classic Mary Roach terrain: the questions explored in Gulp are as taboo, in their way, as the cadavers in Stiff and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in Packing for Mars. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find words for flavors and smells? Why doesn’t the stomach digest itself? How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? In Gulp we meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks of—or has the courage to ask. We go on location to a pet-food taste-test lab, a fecal transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal. With Roach at our side, we travel the world, meeting murderers and mad scientists, Eskimos and exorcists (who have occasionally administered holy water rectally), rabbis and terrorists—who, it turns out, for practical reasons do not conceal bombs in their digestive tracts.Like all of Roach’s books, Gulp is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies.",,,01/04/13,April 1st 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780393081572,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352232547l/13615414.jpg,3.93,"['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)']",92.0,1.0,,,,93.0,40512.0,348,W.

Gloriana,,Fiction,"A fable satirizing Spenser's ""The Fairie Queen"" and reflecting the real life of Elizabeth I, tells of a woman who ascends to the throne upon the death of her debauched and corrupted father, King Hern. Gloriana's reign brings the Empire of Albion into a Golden Age, but her oppressive responsibilities choke her, prohibiting any form of sexual satisfaction, no matter what fetish she tries. Her problem is in fact symbolic of the hypocrisy of her entire court. While her life is meant to mirror that of her nation - an image of purity, virtue, enlightenment and prosperity - the truth is that her peaceful empire is kept secure by her wicked chancellor Monfallcon and his corrupt network of spies and murderers, the most sinister of whom is Captain Quire, who is commissioned to seduce Gloriana and thus bring down Albion and the entire empire.",,,,2004.0,,,0446691402,9780446691406,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6j3QtgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.64,,,,,,,,,496.0,,,1699.0,,,['Michael Moorcock']

A new Golden Age of peace, enlightenment and prosperity has dawned. Gloriana is Albion and Albion is Gloriana; if one falls, so too will the other.

The maintenance of the delicate balance that keeps Albion and Gloriana thriving depends of Montfallcon, Gloriana's Chancellor, and on his network of spies and assassins - in particular on Quire, cold hearted seducer of virtue and murderer of innocence. When Quire falls out with Montfallcon, he forms an alliance with his greatest enemy and conceives a plan to ruin Gloriana, destroy Albion, the empire and the Golden Age itself.

A sua divulgação em DVD, no final de 2004, transformou o GATO FEDORENTO num impressionante fenómeno de popularidade transgeracional em todo o país.O que muitos dos seus apreciadores desconhecem é que GATO FEDORENTO é também um blog, mais concretamente ""(...) um blog de opiniões e de polémica. Aliás, a polémica começa logo nesta apresentação porque, dos quatro autores do Gato Fedorento, um acha que o blog não devia ter polémica, outro defende que não devia ter opiniões e outro entende que não devia ser um blog, mas sim um espectáculo de marionetas. O quarto não quis dar a sua opinião, atitude que os outros três consideraram polémica.""O livro que agora se publica reúne, nas suas mais de 300 páginas, centenas de textos ali escritos de Abril de 2003 a Abril de 2005.

Naturalmente, a atenção recai mais sobre os acontecimentos escaldantes que pontuaram os dois últimos anos, até porque foram muitos: os casos Casa Pia e Universidade Moderna, o Euro 2004 e toda a panóplia de temáticas que o futebol sempre proporciona, as Finanças (da Ministra Ferreira Leite ao Ministro Bagão Félix), as Mães de Bragança, Santana Lopes gerindo Lisboa e, depois, o país, a fuga de Fátima Felgueiras (e o ataque, em Felgueiras, a Francisco Assis), obras literárias (de Margarida Rebelo Pinto a José Saramago e Lídia Jorge) ou de divulgação divina (de Alexandra Solnado), debates em torno da despenalização do aborto, das drogas leves, da adopção de crianças por homossexuais, programas televisivos (concursos, novelas, telejornais), e o estrangeiro e a política externa, para mencionar apenas alguns tópicos. Tudo o que faz o quotidiano de um povo pequeno, resumidamente.Como se não bastasse, o livro avança com um texto inédito que revela 'Como escrever um texto humorístico'.

Get 'Er Sideways: A Story About a Muscle Car and its Couple.,,[],"New Book featuring mid-sixties muscle cars when they were used as Detroit intended: to tear up the streets.  At the age of 16 years old Mike Banks searched for the fastest car he could find. What he found was a fast car among fast cars; a real deal, tire squalling, big block American Muscle Car. This old car became a part of Banks’ identity and launched an interest which became both a hobby and a business and the car has ultimately become a family heirloom. After marrying and starting a family Banks sold his car. After decades and an extensive search, he was able to get it back.  In Get ‘Er Sideways author Mike Banks explains what it felt like to be a kid with a car so fast that its reputation spread across several counties. The stories in this book all happened in, around, or because of this car. From the hilarious accounts of high school age boys ripping through town in mid-sixties muscle cars to the sweet recounting of meeting and falling in love with his wife, and the emotional tale of losing his beloved car and finding it again, the stories in this book will throw you back in your seat.   FROM THE AUTHOR:  There is nothing like the sound and feeling of two hot cars coming off the line together on a hot summer night, windows down on a narrow two lane road, the sounds of tires squalling and carburetors sucking air, feeling the tires break loose at the shift points. You can pay $100 to watch fuel funny cars and dragsters go over 300 MPH and threaten to break your ear drums, but you can’t buy what I just described. At the age of 16, I went on a hunt for the fastest car I could find. What I found was a 1967 Plymouth GTX with a 440 engine. The stories in this book have this car as a sort of home base. These things happened in, around, and sometimes because of this car. This old car became part of my identity and launched an interest which became both my hobby and my business and ultimately has become a family heirloom.I sold this car as a young man starting a family. Decades later after an extensive search I was miraculously able to find it and get it back.I hope I can portray to you with this book something that cannot be replicated today: what it felt like to own and operate a true American muscle car when they weren’t expensive collectors’ items, but were just being used the way Detroit intended. The impressions that these cars performance made on the people that were there and experienced them is the reason for their popularity today. They have become legends.Just as I used to invite my friends to open the door of the old GTX so I could take them for an adrenaline-filled ride, I now invite you to open the cover of this book and get in.",,,,June 18th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,,B07DVVR72Y,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1530578554l/40696691._SY475_.jpg,4.5,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,4.0,230,,[],,[],,['Mike Banks']

"Geisha, a Life",,"['Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Asia', 'Autobiography', 'Historical', 'Japanese Literature', 'Biography Memoir']","""No woman in the three-hundred-year history of the karyukai has ever come forward in public to tell her story. We have been constrained by unwritten rules not to do so, by the robes of tradition and by the sanctity of our exclusive calling...But I feel it is time to speak out.""Celebrated as the most successful geisha of her generation, Mineko Iwasaki was only five years old when she left her parents' home for the world of the geisha. For the next twenty-five years, she would live a life filled with extraordinary professional demands and rich rewards. She would learn the formal customs and language of the geisha, and study the ancient arts of Japanese dance and music. She would enchant kings and princes, captains of industry, and titans of the entertainment world, some of whom would become her dearest friends. Through great pride and determination, she would be hailed as one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, and one of the last great practitioners of this now fading art form.In Geisha, a Life, Mineko Iwasaki tells her story, from her warm early childhood, to her intense yet privileged upbringing in the Iwasaki okiya (household), to her years as a renowned geisha, and finally, to her decision at the age of twenty-nine to retire and marry, a move that would mirror the demise of geisha culture. Mineko brings to life the beauty and wonder of Gion Kobu, a place that ""existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past."" She illustrates how it coexisted within post-World War II Japan at a time when the country was undergoing its radical transformation from a post-feudal society to a modern one.""There is much mystery and misunderstanding about what it means to be a geisha. I hope this story will help explain what it is really like and also serve as a record of this unique component of Japan's cultural history,"" writes Mineko Iwasaki. Geisha, a Life is the first of its kind, as it delicately unfolds the fabric of a geisha's development.

Ghazals of Ghalib,,"['Poetry', 'India']","GHALIB WAS AN OUTSTANDING poet in both Persian and Urdu, though his family may have come from Afghanistan. His father and uncle both led mercenary soldiers in the service of one rajah or another in Northern India. Unfortunately for Ghalib, they both died when he was young, and he had to find a way to support himself.HE FOUND HIS CALLING as a court poet, in and out of favor. When the Sepoy Mutiny took place around him, he addressed a letter to Queen Victoria, offering his services — for a price — to her.THE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP to God took many ironic forms. As he lived next to a mosque, he said he was God's neighbor. His love affair with God was the occasion of many poems of unrequited love, of the cruel mistress. Such an erotic connection to the divine may seem alien to Western minds, but Ghalib was not alone in this personal relationship; he merely took it to its height.THE GHAZAL FORMAT of poetry is composed of a short series of two rhyming lines (not kept in the translation), each one a complete thought in itself. The resulting poem has a theme, but not continuity — much like a stand-up comic's delivery of short jokes on a topic.

  What do you do when you’re trapped between death and the devil? To protect her young daughter from a madman and a tyrant, Rachel Pryne must trust an enemy - one of the alien warriors who conquered Earth.
  It is 2032, the Ohnenrai - Earth’s humanoid alien conquerors - orbit the planet, and Terran reproduction is failing. Rachel Pryne, a trained medic, is struggling to protect her seven-year-old daughter, Pearl, from the sexual predation of their penal colony’s leader. Having fathered the girl by rape, he now intends to take her on her eighth birthday, only six weeks away.
  Then Rachel finds her unlikely champion - an injured Ohnenrai soldier who appears in her yard one stormy evening. She knows she may be choosing death over the devil in trusting this warrior, but she doesn’t know that her trust, and her DNA, will make her one of the most important and endangered people to ever set foot aboard an Ohnenrai starship.

    Equal parts science fiction, suspense, and romance, Girl Under Glass moves from a post-apocalyptic wilderness in the American Pacific Northwest to a high-tech world aboard an alien starship furnished with all the stolen comforts of Earth. Readers meet Rachel Pryne, whose parents' lifelong and life-ending connection to the Ohnenrai has set her upon a path she never wanted to travel. And they're introduced to Ehtishem, an Ohnenrai soldier who exists to save his dying people, but who faces enemies from within and without his own military.
  
  
    The only possible solution to the Ohnenrai’s extinction lies within Rachel, but all she wants to do is protect her daughter and see Earth’s alien conquerors go straight to hell.

Gebrauchsanweisung für Wien,,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel']","In der Serie der Gebrauchsanweisungen für die schönste Art, das Weite zu suchen gibt es nun auch eine vertiefende Reiseanleitung für Wien. Grundkenntnisse der Stadt werden vorausgesetzt, in diesem Buch finden Sie weder einen Stadtplan noch ein Verzeichnis von Sehenswürdigkeiten. Nicht um Sightseeing geht es, sondern darum, die Wiener Lebensart kennen zu lernen und möglicherweise auch zu verstehen. Monika Czernin, ehemals Kulturredakteurin der Wiener Tageszeitung Die Presse, lebt heute in München und weiß, was deutsche Reisende gehobenen Standards an Wien interessiert. Sie kennt die feinen Unterschiede der Kaffehäuser, der Bälle und der edlen Hotels. Sie erzählt vom ""roten Wien"" genauso wie vom alten Adel. Flott verbindet die geborene Autorin Zeitgeist mit Tradition und findet die Wien-Klischees von Charme, Skurrilität, Nörgelei und Morbidität in einem reichen Anekdotenschatz nur bestätigt. Liebevoll zitiert sie all die kleinen Aperçus der Wiener Hautvolee, die so typisch sind für einen Gesellschaftskreis, der immer noch fest in der Vergangenheit wurzelt. Nichts ist in Wien so wichtig wie Kultur. Als Mitglied einer alt-österreichischen Familie weiß Monika Czernin, wie und auf welchem Parkett man sich in Wien bewegen muss, wenn man dazu gehören will. Ihr eigenes gesellschaftliches Crossover zwischen Kaisermühlen und Hotel Sacher, Johannsclub-Ball (ein sehr elitäres Unternehmen) und Flex (Dancefloor am Donaukanal) zitiert die Autorin gerne für kulturelle Flexiblität. Da müssen Touristen wenigstens wissen, wie man richtig Wiener Schnitzel bestellt, ohne sich zu blamieren. Aber nachdem Sie die Gebrauchsanweisung für Wien gelesen haben, wird Ihnen das nicht passieren und Sie werden sich über viele Eigenarten der Stadtbewohner nicht mehr wundern, da Sie Wien nun endlich ""von innen her"" kennen gelernt haben. --Beatrice Simonsen",,,01/01/07,"Vienna/Wien

Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest.Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learns the skills and charm that befit a king's consort.

Giants in the Earth,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Americana', 'Westerns', 'American']","Giants in the Earth (Norwegian: Verdens Grøde) is a novel by Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag. First published in Norway as two books in 1924 and 1925, the author collaborated with Minnesotan Lincoln Colcord on the English translation.The novel follows a Norwegian family's struggles as they try to make a new life as pioneers in the Dakota territory. Rølvaag is interested in psychology and the human cost of empire building, at a time when other writers focused on the glamor and romance of the West. The book reflects his personal experiences as a settler as well as the immigrant homesteader experience of his wife’s family. Both the grim realities of pioneering and the gloomy fatalism of the Norse mind are captured in depictions of snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land. It is a novel at once palpably European and distinctly American.Giants in the Earth was turned into an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.",Fortælling om norske nykommere i Amerika #1 & 2,,10/28/25,August 4th 1999,['Per Hansa'],Paperback,,9780060931933,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401111215l/57586.jpg,4.01,[],962.0,11.0,,,,92.0,5014.0,531,Harper Perennial Modern Classics,"['1862', '1816', '957', '261', '118']",,['Dakota Territory (United States)'],,"['O.

The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone ""brothers"" have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies. Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood.The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster. Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again.

The book she was writing about Isaac Newton’s involvement with alchemy—the culmination of her lifelong obsession with the seventeenth century—remains unfinished. When her son, Cameron, asks his former lover, Lydia Brooke, to ghostwrite the missing final chapters of his mother’s book, Lydia agrees and moves into Elizabeth’s house—a studio in an orchard where the light moves restlessly across the walls. Soon Lydia discovers that the shadow of violence that has fallen across present-day Cambridge, which escalates to a series of murders, may have its origins in the troubling evidence that Elizabeth’s research has unearthed. As Lydia becomes ensnared in a dangerous conspiracy that reawakens ghosts of the past, the seventeenth century slowly seeps into the twenty-first, with the city of Cambridge the bridge between them.Filled with evocative descriptions of Cambridge, past and present, of seventeenth-century glassmaking, alchemy, the Great Plague, and Newton’s scientific innovations, Ghostwalk centers around a real historical mystery that Rebecca Stott has uncovered involving Newton’s alchemy. In it, time and relationships are entangled—the present with the seventeenth century, and figures from the past with the love-torn twenty-first century woman who is trying to discover their secrets.

Gaza Writes Back (#1),,"['Nonfiction', 'Short Stories', 'Politics', 'History']","""Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine"", edited by Refaat Alareer is a compelling collection of short stories from fifteen young writers in Gaza, members of a generation that has suffered immensely under Israel’s siege and blockade. Their experiences, especially during and following Israel’s 2008-2009 offensive known as “Operation Cast Lead”, have fundamentally impacted their lives and their writing. Indeed, many of these writers saw the war as a catalyst for their writing, as they sought an outlet and a voice in its aftermath. They view the book as a means of preserving Palestinian memories and presenting their own narratives to the world without filters. Their words take us into the homes and hearts of moms, dads, students, children, and elders striving to live lives of dignity, compassion, and meaning in one of the world’s most embattled communities. (Some of the stories also take us with courage and empathy into the imagined world of Israelis living just on the other side of the great barriers Israel has built in and around Gaza and the West Bank to wall the Palestinians in.) These stories are acts of resistance and defiance, proclaiming the endurance of Palestinians and the continuing resilience and creativity of their culture in the face of ongoing obstacles and attempts to silence them.  Whether tackling the tragedy that surrounds missile strikes and home raids, or the everyday indignities encountered by Palestinian refugees, Gaza Writes Back brings to life the real issues that the people of Gaza face. One prominent theme in many of the stories is the value placed on the wisdom of parents and grandparents. A sense of longing pervades the book, as the characters in the stories reveal desires ranging from the mundane to the complex—including, in several of the stories, a strong yearning to return to the characters’ long-cherished family homes and properties after many decades in exile from them. Social differences within Gaza are also sensitively explored. A few stories are especially difficult—but critical—to digest , for the vividness with which they depict the experiences of victims of Israeli military strikes and confront the legacy of violence and occupation, particularly on young people.Readers will be moved by the struggles big and small that emerge from the well-crafted writing by these young people, and by the hope and courage that radiates from the authors’ biographies. The contributors are university students and recent graduates, Palestinians who have chosen to speak out in their second language, which is an “expressive way to be more creative in a world where words are significantly mighty,” according to Tasnim Hamouda. Another contributor, Nour El Borno, believes “that if a person can write effectively, it is his or her duty to get up, write, and help change this world to something better.” Five years after Operation Cast Lead, these stories remind us that the pain lingers on and the people of Gaza will be forever scarred by the attack. Yet, the call for justice remains forceful and persistent, and these young Gazan writers refuse to let the world forget about them—their land, their people, and their story.",,first edition,,January 15th 2014,[],Paperback,,9781935982357,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383643253l/18754110.jpg,4.23,[],100.0,1.0,,,,93.0,181.0,208,Just World Books,"['94', '54', '20', '6', '7']",,[],,['Refaat Alareer']

Graphic Design,A Concise History,Art,"From its roots in the development of printing, graphic design has evolved as a means of identification, information, and promotion to become a profession and discipline in its own right. This authoritative documentary history begins with the poster and goes on to chart the development of word and image in brochures and magazines, advertising, corporate identity, television, and electronic media, and the impact of technical innovations such as photography and the computer. For the revised edition, a new final chapter covers all the recent international developments in graphic design, including the role of the computer and the Internet in design innovation and globalization. In the last years of the twentieth century, at a time when ""designer products"" and the use of logos grew in importance, the role of graphic designers became more complex, subversive, and sometimes more politicalwitness Oliviero Toscani's notorious advertisements for Benetton. Digital technology cleared the way for an astonishing proliferation of new typefaces, and words began to take second place to typography in a whole range of magazines and books as designers asserted the primacy of their medium.

The book begins by describing the difference between educational cultures that praise students for ""right answers"" and the law school culture that rewards nuanced analysis of ambiguous situations in which more than one approach may be correct. Enormous care is devoted to explaining precisely how and why legal analysis frequently produces such perplexing situations. But the authors don't stop with mere description. Instead, Getting to Maybe teaches how to excel on law school exams by showing the reader how legal analysis can be brought to bear on examination problems. The book contains hints on studying and preparation that go well beyond conventional advice. The authors also illustrate how to argue both sides of a legal issue without appearing wishy-washy or indecisive. Above all, the book explains why exam questions may generate feelings of uncertainty or doubt about correct legal outcomes and how the student can turn these feelings to his or her advantage.

Unlike some of those on Guadalcanal in the fall of 1942, Richard Tregaskis volunteered to be there. An on-location news correspondent (at the time, one of only two on Guadalcanal), he lived alongside the soldiers: sleeping on the ground--only to be awoken by air raids--eating the sometimes meager rations, and braving some of the most dangerous battlefields of World War II. He more than once narrowly escaped the enemy's fire, and so we have this incisive and exciting inside account of the groundbreaking initial landing of U.S. troops on Guadalcanal.With a new Introduction by Mark Bowden--renowned journalist and author of Black Hawk Down--this edition of Guadalcanal Diary makes available once more one of the most important American works of the war.",U.S. Landmark Books #55,,03/07/43,May 30th 2000,[],Paperback,,9780679640233,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403188593l/55360.jpg,4.25,[],94.0,2.0,,,,97.0,3913.0,250,Modern Library,"['1861', '1334', '597', '95', '26']",,['Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands)'],,"['Richard Tregaskis', 'Mark Bowden']"

He is best known for the historical novel I, Claudius and the critical study of myth and poetry The White Goddess. His autobiography, Goodbye to All That, was published in 1929, quickly establishing itself as a modern classic.

Known by insiders as ""the System,"" the Camorra affects cities and villages along the Neapolitan coast, and is the deciding factor in why Campania, for instance, has the highest murder rate in all of Europe and whycancer levels there have skyrocketed in recent years.Saviano tells of huge cargoes of Chinese goods that are shipped to Naples and then quickly distributed unchecked across Europe.

Now, in Book 2 of her most stunning trilogy yet, Hobb continues the soul-shattering tale of FitzChivalry Farseer. With rich characters, breathtaking magic, and sweeping action, Golden Fool brings the reluctant adventurer further into the fray in an epic of sacrifice, salvation, and untold treachery.Golden FoolPrince Dutiful has been rescued from his Piebald kidnappers and the court has resumed its normal rhythms. But for FitzChivalry Farseer, a return to isolation is impossible. Though gutted by the loss of his wolf bondmate, Nighteyes, Fitz must take up residence at Buckkeep and resume his tasks as Chade’s apprentice assassin. Posing as Tom Badgerlock, bodyguard to Lord Golden, FitzChivalry becomes the eyes and ears behind the walls. And with his old mentor failing visibly, Fitz is forced to take on more burdens as he attempts to guide a kingdom straying closer to civil strife each day.The problems are legion. Prince Dutiful’s betrothal to the Narcheska Elliania of the Out Islands is fraught with tension, and the Narcheska herself appears to be hiding an array of secrets. Then, amid Piebald threats and the increasing persecution of the Witted, FitzChivalry must ensure that no one betrays the Prince’s secret—a secret that could topple the Farseer throne: that he, like Fitz, possesses the dread “beast magic.”Meanwhile, FitzChivalry must impart to the Prince his limited knowledge of the Skill: the hereditary and addictive magic of the Farseers. In the process, they discover within Buckkeep one who has a wild and powerful talent for it, and whose enmity for Fitz may have disastrous consequences for all.Only Fitz’s enduring friendship with the Fool brings him any solace. But even that is shattered when unexpected visitors from Bingtown reveal devastating secrets from the Fool’s past. Now, bereft of support and adrift in intrigue, Fitz’s biggest challenge may be simply to survive the inescapable and violent path that fate has laid out for him.From the Hardcover edition.",The Tawny Man #2,,10/21/02,December 2003,"['The Fool', 'FitzChivalry Farseer', 'Chade Fallstar', 'Kettricken', 'Dutiful Farseer', 'Thick']",Mass Market Paperback,,9780553582451,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388182007l/45109.jpg,4.31,[],1124.0,14.0,,,,97.0,66660.0,709,Spectra,"['32753', '24284', '7614', '1360', '649']",,[],,['Robin Hobb']

Garcia Marquez: Los Funerales de la Mama Grande,,[],"Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the most celebrated, and most widely read, Latin American novelist of his generation. His highly-acclaimed work includes One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Autumn of the Patriarch and Love in the Time of Cholera.

A principal exponent of 'magical realism', his work forms a significant part of the debate about postmodernist writing, and the study of fantasy as a genre.

In Ron Currie's provocative, wise, and emotionally resonant novel we meet God himself; the Dinka woman whose mortality He must suffer when He inhabits her body; people all over the world coping with the devastating news of God's demise; a group of young men who, fearing the end of the world, take fate into their own hands; mental patients who insist that a god still exists; armies taking up the eternal war between fate and free will; and parents who, in the absence of a deity and the “lack of anything to do on Sundays,” worship their children. On the surface, this is a world utterly transformed—yet certain things remain unchanged: protective parents clash with willful, idealistic teenagers; idols are exalted; small-town rumor mills run unabated; and children often don't realize how to forgive their parents until it's too late.In God Is Dead, Currie brings together a prescient satirical gift worthy of Jonathan Swift, the raw appeal of Chuck Palahniuk's blackest comedy, and the thought-provoking ethical questions of Kurt Vonnegut, all with a light touch, empathy, and wisdom that make for an exhilarating reading experience.

Game Misconduct: Alan Eagleson and the Corruption of Hockey,,"['Sports', 'Hockey', 'Nonfiction', 'History']","Russ Conway has worked at the Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Massachusetts, since 1967. For more than five years, he pursued the details of this fascinating story, an investigation that focused increasingly on the activities of Canada’s Alan Eagleson, once regarded as the most powerful figure in professional hockey. Conway’s series for the Eagle Tribune, “Cracking Ice,” from which this book was developed has been at the heart of the FBI and US Justice Department investigations that led to the 1994 indictment of Alan Eagleson.Among other things, Conway’s sensational exposé documents the following:Eagleson’s defrauding of injured players seeking career-ending disability insurance.Eagleson’s use of National Hockey League Players’ Association money for questionable and unauthorized loans to friends and associates, one of whom was also his partner in business ventures.Eagleson’s exploitation of his position as head of the NHLPA and driving force behind the Canada Cup to obtain everything from free clothing to free air travel to France.Eagleson’s outright theft of Canada Cup money via a scheme that saw Irving Ungerman’s company, All Canada Sports, retain control of end-board advertising during Team Canada games.Conway’s discovery, while investigating the conduct of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into Eagleson that Timothy Lemay, a lawyer on loan from the federal Department of Justice, was working out of the same office in Newmarket, Ontario, as the RCMP, which was collaborating with US authorities. Lemay worked for Eagleson’s law firm; Eagleson had Lemay do work for Hockey Canada; Lemay is Eagleson’s son’s brother-in-law.Game Misconduct is much more than a sports story: it embraces business, politics, and true crime; indeed, some have called it the biggest scandal in professional sports since the 1919 Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. It is unquestionably among the most impressive and explosive examples of determined, investigative journalism in recent years.From the Hardcover edition.",,,11/05/95,January 1st 1997,[],Paperback,,9781551990187,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266761690l/2363379.jpg,4.08,[],94.0,1.0,,,,99.0,95.0,324,Macfarlane Walter & Ross,"['31', '42', '21', '1', '0']",,[],,['Russ Conway']

There, an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. For nearly a decade, 34-year-old Claire Waverley, at peace with her family inheritance, has lived in the house alone, embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her, ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister, Sydney, who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions, Claire has built a successful catering business -- and a carefully controlled, utterly predictable life -- upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility, for instance, or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. Garden Spells reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter, turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming, the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another, each finds romance where she least expects it, while Sydney's child, Bay, discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts.

Adams describes God's Debris as a thought experiment wrapped in a story. It's designed to make your brain spin around inside your skull. Imagine that you meet a very old man who you eventually realize knows literally everything. Imagine that he explains for you the great mysteries of life: quantum physics, evolution, God, gravity, light psychic phenomenon, and probability in a way so simple, so novel, and so compelling that it all fits together and makes perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly understand everything? You may not find the final answer to the big question, but God's Debris might provide the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read.

Gaia and the New Politics of Love: Notes for a Poly Planet,,"['Nonfiction', 'Polyamory', 'Sexuality', 'Sociology']","***WINNER, 2010 Nautilus Silver Book Award – Cosmology/New ScienceGaia theory argues that the flora and fauna of the planet operate in a self-regulating web that keeps the world livable. According to the theory, humankind is the most powerful species in this web and also its biggest threat. This provocative book explores ways to minimize and ultimately eliminate this threat with love and intimacy. Controversial Italian author Serena Anderlini-D’Onofrio has authored the first global ecology study based on an analysis of human health. Anderlini-D’Onofrio identifies her remedy within the context of Gaia theory, re-envisioning it as a more inclusive philosophy that positively impacts not only relationships, but world ecology under duress. The author links human sexuality to the global ecosystem, claiming that freedom from fear will stimulate a holistic health movement powerful enough to heal relationships and restore planetary balance.Gaia and the New Politics of Love is bracing in its range, weaving together issues of human and global health; the relationship of politics, sexuality, and ecology; practices and styles of love; the changing roles of eroticism and gender in our lives; and polyamory, bisexuality, and the AIDS reappraisal movement.Clarification Statement from the AuthorThe argument of this book emphasizes the arts of loving as a way to help humanity make peace with our hostess Gaia, the third planet. Some of these arts involve sharing emotional resources and amorous partners.Often, the arts of loving require the use of barriers: mechanical protections such as condoms. At times they do not because only tantric energies are exchanged. The author of this book is persuaded that barriers are recommendable when sexual practices result in the exchange of deep body fluids, unless previous fluid-bonding arrangements have been made. The author is also persuaded that good practices of holistic health contribute to strengthening the immune systems of those who engage in the arts of loving.Safety practices are important in making the arts of loving healthy regardless of what factors are involved in the syndromes most prevalent today, including AIDS and other conditions in the STD spectrum. Historically, disagreement has moved knowledge forward: Today’s science is the result of yesterday’s disagreements and controversies. The author believes in critical thinking and she respects dissidence in science today, including Gaia science, reappraisals of AIDS, and holistic medicine. She hopes her readers will be open to hearing more than one side of a story.This statement and the contents of this book do not constitute medical advice in any way. Readers are invited to consult their own healers and health care providers.Serena Anderlini-D’Onofrio, PhDAuthor of Gaia and the New Politics of LoveCabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, March 2010Blog: http://polyplanet.blogspot.com/",,,,September 8th 2009,[],Paperback,,9781556438219,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320396885l/6377319.jpg,4.38,['Nautilus Book Award for Cosmology/New Science (2010)'],196.0,2.0,,,,100.0,8.0,272,North Atlantic Books,"['4', '3', '1', '0', '0']",,[],,"[""Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio""]"

"George Sprott, 1894-1975",,"['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Fiction', 'Comic Book', 'Canada', 'Comix', 'Read For School']","
  First serialized in The New York Times Magazine “Funny Pages”The celebrated cartoonist and New Yorker illustrator Seth weaves the fictional tale of George Sprott, the host of a long-running television program. The events forming the patchwork of George’s life are pieced together from the tenuous memories of several informants, who often have contradictory impressions. His estranged daughter describes the man as an unforgivable lout, whereas his niece remembers him fondly. His former assistant recalls a trip to the Arctic during which George abandoned him for two months, while George himself remembers that trip as the time he began writing letters to a former love, from whom he never received replies.Invoking a sense of both memory and its loss, George Sprott is heavy with the charming, melancholic nostalgia that distinguishes Seth’s work. Characters lamenting societal progression in general share the pages with images of antiquated objects—proof of events and individuals rarely documented and barely remembered. Likewise, George’s own opinions are embedded with regret and a sense of the injustice of aging in this bleak reminder of the inevitable slipping away of lives, along with the fading culture of their days.

"Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon - and the Journey of a Generation",,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Womens', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Memoir', 'Pop Culture', 'Unfinished']","A groundbreaking and irresistible biography of three of America's most important musical artists -- Carole King, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon -- charts their lives as women at a magical moment in time. Carole King, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon remain among the most enduring and important women in popular music. Each woman is distinct. Carole King is the product of outer-borough, middle-class New York City; Joni Mitchell is a granddaughter of Canadian farmers; and Carly Simon is a child of the Manhattan intellectual upper crust. They collectively represent, in their lives and their songs, a great swath of American girls who came of age in the late 1960s. Their stories trace the arc of the now mythic sixties generation -- female version -- but in a bracingly specific and deeply recalled way, far from cliche. The history of the women of that generation has never been written -- until now, through their resonant lives and emblematic songs. Filled with the voices of many dozens of these women's intimates, who are speaking in these pages for the first time, this alternating biography reads like a novel -- except it's all true, and the heroines are famous and beloved. Sheila Weller captures the character of each woman and gives a balanced portrayal enriched by a wealth of new information.

Greek tragedies,,Drama,"The Grene and Lattimore edition of the Greek tragedies has been among the most widely acclaimed and successful publications of the University of Chicago Press. On the occasion of the Centennial of the University of Chicago and its Press, we take pleasure in reissuing this complete work in a handsome four-volume slipcased edition as well as in redesigned versions of the familiar paperbacks. For the Centennial Edition two of the original translations have been replaced. In the original publication David Grene translated only one of the three Theban plays, Oedipus the King. Now he has added his own translations of the remaining two, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, thus bringing a new unity of tone and style to this group. Grene has also revised his earlier translation of Prometheus Bound and rendered some of the former prose sections in verse. These new translations replace the originals included in the paperback volumes Sophocles I (which contains all three Theban plays), Aeschylus II, Greek Tragedies, Volume I, and Greek Tragedies, Volume III, all of which are now being published in second editions.

God is Just: A Defense of the Old Testament Civil Laws,,['Law'],"This book is a defense of biblical civil law, on topics despised not only by humanists, but by professing Christians. It is, in short, theonomic apologetics. God is Just takes our culture and its attacks on the Bible to task. It defends biblical theocracy, justice, and slavery, and cuts humanistic opposition down to size by its own self-destructive foolishness, and, most importantly, by the sword of God’s word.In addition, the book includes appendices defending theonomy biblically and historically, as well as appendices refuting alternative political philosophies. God is Just includes contributions from two of the most prolific next-generation theonomic writers, Buddy Hanson and Daniel F. N. Ritchie. Hanson (of Grace and Law Resource Center) wrote the forward, and Ritchie (of Reformed Worldview Books) wrote an appendix.

When Venkatesh walked into an abandoned building in one of Chicago's most notorious housing projects, he was looking for people to take a multiple-choice survey on urban poverty. A first-year grad student, he would befriend a gang leader named JT and spend the better part of the next decade inside the projects under JT's protection, documenting what he saw there.   Over the next seven years, Venkatesh observed JT and the rest of the gang as they operated their crack selling business, conducted PR within their community, and rose up or fell within the ranks of the gang's complex organizational structure.   Gang Leader for a Day is an inside view into the morally ambiguous, highly intricate, often corrupt struggle to survive in an urban war zone.

Good People in an Evil Time,,"['War', 'History']","In the 1990s Svetlana Broz, granddaughter of former Yugoslav head of state Marshal Tito, volunteered her services as a physician in war-torn Bosnia. She discovered that her patients were not only in need of medical care, but that they urgently had a story to tell, a story suppressed by nationalist politicians and the mainstream media. What Broz heard compelled her to devote herself over the next several years to the collection of firsthand testimonies from the war. These testimonies show that ordinary people can and do resist the murderous ideology of genocide even under the most terrible historical circumstances. We are introduced to Mile Plakalovic, a magnificent humanist, who drove his taxi through the streets of Sarajevo, picking the wounded up off the sidewalk and delivering food and clothing to young and old, even when the bombing was at its worst. We meet Velimir Milosevic, poet, who traveled with an actor and entertained children as they hid in basements to avoid the bombing and gunfire, and we hear the stories of countless others who put themselves in grave danger to help others, regardless of ethnic background. Faced with a world in which unspeakable crimes not only went unpunished but were rewarded with glory, profit, and power, the Bosnians of all faiths who testify in this book were starkly confronted with the limits and possibilities of their own ethical choices. Here, in their own words they describe how people helped one another across ethnic lines and refused the myths promoted by the engineers of genocide. This book refutes the stereotype of inevitable natural enmities in the Balkans and reveals the responsibility of individual actions and political manipulations for the genocide; it is a searing portrait of the experience of war as well as a provocative study of the possibilities of resistance and solidarity. The testimonies reverberate far beyond the frontiers of the former Yugoslavia.

The news of Kweku’s death sends a ripple around the world, bringing together the family he abandoned years before. Ghana Must Go is their story. Electric, exhilarating, beautifully crafted, Ghana Must Go is a testament to the transformative power of unconditional love, from a debut novelist of extraordinary talent.  Moving with great elegance through time and place, Ghana Must Go charts the Sais’ circuitous journey to one another. In the wake of Kweku’s death, his children gather in Ghana at their enigmatic mother’s new home. The eldest son and his wife; the mysterious, beautiful twins; the baby sister, now a young woman: each carries secrets of his own. What is revealed in their coming together is the story of how they came apart: the hearts broken, the lies told, the crimes committed in the name of love. Splintered, alone, each navigates his pain, believing that what has been lost can never be recovered—until, in Ghana, a new way forward, a new family, begins to emerge.Ghana Must Go is at once a portrait of a modern family, and an exploration of the importance of where we come from to who we are. In a sweeping narrative that takes us from Accra to Lagos to London to New York, Ghana Must Go teaches that the truths we speak can heal the wounds we hide.",,,,March 5th 2013,"['Kweku Sai', 'Folasadé Savage']",Hardcover,,9781594204494,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1350363439l/15811505.jpg,3.84,['PEN Open Book Award Nominee for Shortlist (2014)'],166.0,2.0,,,,91.0,9725.0,336,Penguin Press,"['2739', '3828', '2255', '696', '207']",,"['Accra (Ghana)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'London, England', 'New York City, New York (United States)']",,['Taiye Selasi']

Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-scale Permaculture,,"['Gardening', 'Nonfiction', 'Nature', 'Sustainability', 'Environment', 'Reference', 'Food', 'Ecology', 'Agriculture', 'Horticulture']","Permaculture is a verbal marriage of ""permanent"" and ""agriculture."" Australian Bill Mollison pioneered its development. Key features include:- use of compatible perennials;- non-invasive planting techniques;- emphasis on biodiversity;- specifically adaptable to local climate, landscape, and soil conditions;- highly productive output of edibles.Now, picture your backyard as one incredibly lush garden, filled with edible flowers, bursting with fruit and berries, and carpeted with scented herbs and tangy salad greens. The visual impact is of Monet's palette, a wash of color, texture, and hue. But this is no still life. The flowers nurture endangered pollinators. Bright-featured songbirds feed on abundant berries and gather twigs for their nests.The plants themselves are grouped in natural communities, where each species plays a role in building soil, deterring pests, storing nutrients, and luring beneficial insects. And finally, you—good ol' homo sapiens—are an integral part of the scene. Your garden tools are resting against a nearby tree, and have a slight patina of rust, because this garden requires so little maintenance. You recline into a hammock to admire your work. You have created a garden paradise.This is no dream, but rather an ecological garden, which takes the principles of permaculture and applies them on a home-scale. There is nothing technical, intrusive, secretive, or expensive about this form of gardening. All that is required is some botanical knowledge (which is in this book) and a mindset that defines a backyard paradise as something other than a carpet of grass fed by MiracleGro.",,,04/01/01,September 27th 2001,[],Paperback,,9781890132521,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387718363l/136542.jpg,4.39,[],93.0,1.0,,,,97.0,3925.0,240,Chelsea Green Publishing Co,"['2179', '1227', '406', '84', '29']",,[],,['Tohemenway']

Glass House,,Architecture,"The Glass House, designed by celebrated architect Philip Johnson as a personal retreat, is an icon of modern architecture. A crystalline box set in a serene New England landscape, the house is now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which will open it to visitors in April 2007.

Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s.

God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist,,"['Science', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Skepticism', 'Spirituality', 'God', 'Reference']","Throughout history, arguments for and against the existence of God have been largely confined to philosophy and theology. In the meantime, science has sat on the sidelines and quietly watched this game of words march up and down the field. Despite the fact that science has revolutionized every aspect of human life and greatly clarified our understanding of the world, somehow the notion has arisen that it has nothing to say about the possibility of a supreme being, which much of humanity worships as the source of all reality. Physicist Victor J. Stenger contends that, if God exists, some evidence for this existence should be detectable by scientific means, especially considering the central role that God is alleged to play in the operation of the universe and the lives of humans. Treating the traditional God concept, as conventionally presented in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, like any other scientific hypothesis, Stenger examines all of the claims made for God's existence. He considers the latest Intelligent Design arguments as evidence of God's influence in biology. He looks at human behavior for evidence of immaterial souls and the possible effects of prayer. He discusses the findings of physics and astronomy in weighing the suggestions that the universe is the work of a creator and that humans are God's special creation. After evaluating all the scientific evidence, Stenger concludes that beyond a reasonable doubt the universe and life appear exactly as we might expect if there were no God.",,,10/30/07,January 2nd 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781591024811,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463550l/98810.jpg,3.93,[],114.0,2.0,,,,90.0,7870.0,294,Prometheus Books,"['3050', '2355', '1648', '485', '332']",,[],,['Victor J.

Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Find It's Not Bad to Be Good,,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Sociology', 'Womens', 'Feminism', 'Sexuality', 'Psychology', 'Christian', 'Cultural', 'Womens Studies']","At twenty-three, Wendy Shalit punctured conventional wisdom with A Return to Modesty, arguing that our hope for true lasting love is not a problem to be fixed but rather a wonderful instinct that forms the basis for civilization. Now, in Girls Gone Mild, the brilliantly outspoken author investigates an emerging new movement. Despite nearly-naked teen models posing seductively to sell us practically everything, and the proliferation of homemade sex tapes as star-making vehicles, a youth-led rebellion is already changing course.In Seattle and Pittsburgh, teenage girls protest against companies that sell sleazy clothing. Online, a nineteen-year-old describes her struggles with her mother, who she feels is pressuring her to lose her virginity. In a small town outside Philadelphia, an eleventh-grade girl, upset over a “dirty book” read aloud in English class, takes her case to the school board. These are not your mother’s rebels.In an age where pornography is mainstream, teen clothing seems stripper-patented, and “experts” recommend that we learn to be emotionally detached about sex, a key (and callously) targeted audience–girls–is fed up. Drawing on numerous studies and interviews, Shalit makes the case that today’s virulent “bad girl” mindset most truly oppresses young women. Nowadays, as even the youngest teenage girls feel the pressure to become cold sex sirens, put their bodies on public display, and suppress their feelings in order to feel accepted and (temporarily) loved, many young women are realizing that “friends with benefits” are often anything but. And as these girls speak for themselves, we see that what is expected of them turns out to be very different from what is in their own hearts.Shalit reveals how the media, one’s peers, and even parents can undermine girls’ quests for their authentic selves, details the problems of sex without intimacy, and explains what it means to break from the herd mentality and choose integrity over popularity. Written with sincerity and upbeat humor, Girls Gone Mild rescues the good girl from the realm of mythology and old manners guides to show that today’s version is the real rebel: She is not “people pleasing” or repressed; she is simply reclaiming her individuality. These empowering stories are sure to be an inspiration to teenagers and parents alike.",,,11/05/07,June 26th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781400064731,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320446663l/282552.jpg,3.62,[],77.0,1.0,,,,82.0,285.0,336,Random House,"['73', '100', '60', '34', '18']",,[],,['Wendy Shalit']

Simon finds chimp behavior a bit unnatural; he can't bring himself to use gestures rather than speech to communicate. He also finds it difficult to mate publicly or accept social grooming. Dr. Zack Busner—also a medical doctor, radical psychoanalyst, maverick axiolytic drug researcher, and former television personality—is prepared to help Simon get used to ""chimpunity"".

God's reputation has come under considerable review in recent days, with some going so far as to say that it's not we who've made a mess of things. Instead whatever it is we call God is to blame.But is such an opinion really a fair assessment?In this magisterial collection, the contemporary complaints against belief in God are addressed with intellectual passion and rigor by some of the most astute theological and philosophical minds of the day: J.

God?: A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist,,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Theology', 'Atheism', 'Christian', 'Science', 'Christianity', 'God']","The question of whether or not God exists is profoundly fascinating and important. Now two articulate spokesmen--one a Christian, the other an atheist--duel over God's existence in an illuminating battle of ideas.  In God? A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist, William Lane Craig and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong bring to the printed page two debates they held before live audiences, preserving all the wit, clarity, and immediacy of their public exchanges. Avoiding overly esoteric arguments, they directly address issues such as religious experience, the Bible, evil, eternity, the origin of the universe, design, and the supposed connection between morality and the existence of God. Employing sharp and humorous arguments, each philosopher strikes quickly to the heart of his opponent's case. For example, Craig claims that we must believe in God in order to explain objective moral values, such as why rape is wrong. Sinnott-Armstrong responds that what makes rape wrong is the harm to victims of rape, so rape is immoral even if there is no God. By assuming a traditional concept of God in their discussion, the authors ensure that they are truly addressing each other's viewpoints and engaging in a disagreement over a unified issue. The book is composed of six chapters that alternate between Craig and Sinnott-Armstrong, so that each separate point can be discussed as it arises. Ideal for courses in the philosophy of religion and introduction to philosophy, this lively and direct dialogue will stimulate students and anyone interested in the existence of God, regardless of whether or not they believe in God.",Point/Counterpoint,,11/06/03,February 12th 2004,[],Paperback,,0000195166000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348437745l/173129.jpg,3.76,[],93.0,1.0,,,,90.0,272.0,156,"Oxford University Press, USA","['74', '92', '80', '19', '7']",,[],,"['William Lane Craig', 'Walter Sinnott-Armstrong']"
