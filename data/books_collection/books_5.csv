55 Years In Five Acts: My Life In Opera,,['Music'],"For Astrid Varnay, opera was the family business. The daughter of coloratura soprano Maria Javor and dramatic tenor Alexander Varnay, she literally grew up backstage at the opera. Vocally and musically trained by her mother and mentor (and later husband) Hermann Weigert, she was just twenty-three years old when she made her unofficial debut at the Metropolitan Opera as a last-minute replacement for the suddenly ill Lotte Lehmann. Varnay's critically acclaimed performance as Sieglinde in Die Walkure catapulted her into the limelight.Varnay reflects on her remarkable life in opera, discussing her signature roles and performances, vocal preparation and technique, interpretive acting style, and her seamless transition from leading soprano to character roles, including her switch from Elektra to Klytemnastra in Strauss's Elektra.Her engaging and witty memoir is filled with frank, often critical, observations about many of the most significant vocal artists, conductors, and directors of the twentieth century. She describes her lifelong friendship with operatic idol Kirsten Flagstad, the years at the Met and conflicts with Rudolf Bing, her appearances at the Bayreuth and Salzburg Festivals, and her artistic rift with Herbert von Karajan.",,,11/30/00,June 1st 2007,[],Paperback,,9781555536756,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348581740l/4582044.jpg,4.25,[],68.0,1.0,,,,94.0,16.0,363,Northeastern University Press,"['8', '5', '2', '1', '0']",,[],,"['Astrid Varnay', 'Donald Arthur']"

Many books that challenge religious belief from a skeptical point of view take a combative tone that is almost guaranteed to alienate believers or they present complex philosophical or scientific arguments that fail to reach the average reader.This is undoubtably an ineffective way of encouraging people to develop critical thinking about religion. This is a unique approach to skepticism regarding that presents fifty commonly heard reasons people often give for believing in a God and then he raises legitimate questions regarding these reasons, showing in each case that there is much room for doubt.Whether you're a believer, a complete skeptic, or somewhere in between, you'll find this review of traditional and more recent arguments for the existence of God refreshing, approachable, and enlightening. From religion as the foundation of morality to the authority of sacred books, the compelling religious testimony of influential people, near-death experiences, arguments from Intelligent Design, and much more, Harrison respectfully describes each rationale for belief and then politely shows the deficiencies that any good skeptic would point out. As a journalist who has traveled widely and interviewed many highly accomplished people, quite a number of whom are believers, the author appreciates the variety of belief and the ways in which people seek to make religion compatible with scientific thought. Nonetheless, he shows that, despite the prevalence of belief in gods or religious belief in intelligent people, in the end there are no unassailable reasons for believing in a god.",,,06/05/08,,[],Kindle Edition,,9781591025672,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328336216l/6652033.jpg,3.96,[],71.0,1.0,,,,91.0,1851.0,354,,"['699', '605', '378', '110', '59']",,[],,['Guy P.

 Lissie, is a nurse in a gritty, hectic London neighborhood. Always terribly competent and good at keeping it all together, she’s been suffering quietly with PTSD after helping to save the victim of a shocking crime. Her supervisor quietly arranges for Lissie to spend a few months doing a much less demanding job in the little town of Kirrinfeif in the Scottish Highlands, hoping that the change of scenery will help her heal.

And adding in the effects of ZBF [zombie bird flu]-- the blurred vision, inconsistent eye-hand coordination, and a cerebral cortex shriveled like Hitler's testicle on an Arctic expedition-- you've got a traffic jam that encircles the city, cuts through the city and clogs up most streets downtown. Yet, while it was the 24/7 bumper-to-bumper traffic that put me over the edge, I have to admit, it's really the globe-wide traffic jams-- with undead motorists honking, growling, and giving whatever fingers that might be left to other zombie motorists-- that have allowed the few remaining uninfected to avoid, so far, being summarily attacked and eaten. Many of them, the survivors, I understand, have gone to Canada. Think of how that must frustrate the Canadian tourism industry to no end!

5 Days FREE of Depression Anxiety and Panic Attacks,,['Mental Health'],"As someone whose life has been focused on working in recovery, first within the medical system, and the last 25 years within LAMB Ministers (a work born of faith in the healing balm of Gods Word and prayer),I have never read anything so real, so riveting, so compelling as this small book is. From the moment I began, I realized that author Rhonda Patton's goal in sharing her journey from fright to light, from house bound to breaking free, from agony to peace in Christ was written for only one purpose, which we read in James 5:16, ""...The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective,"" which is her heart cry so simply said, and I paraphrase. ""That you would not have to go through what she did.""I echo her concern and truly hope no mater whether you think your troubles or you are of no account, reading this book can begin your person journey to freedom.Paula Rose Michelson is the author of Casa de Naomi: The House of Blessing, Books 1&2, and The Naomi Chronicles, Book One, Beginning Anew due to release February 2014.",,,,September 2013,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380748311l/18622163.jpg,4.96,[],89.0,1.0,,,,100.0,23.0,26,,"['22', '1', '0', '0', '0']",,[],,['Rhonda Patton']

Il mondo è diviso in blocchi, in realtà ideologie e frontiere si stanno già sgretolando: merci e droga non conoscono confini. Dall'Italia a Mosca a Hollywood, tra balere, viaggi clandestini oltrefrontiera e incontri di pugilato, una folla di protagonisti, spinti da una corrente che li travolge e li supera, si muove verso uno sbocco ignoto. Nuovi eretici, ex partigiani, contrabbandieri, narcotrafficanti, agenti segreti, figli in cerca di un padre si muovono e si sfiorano, inconsapevoli pedine di un grande disegno. Tra loro c'è Cary Grant, l'attore che da due anni non gira un film, il grande di umili origini, la cui eleganza diventa il metro di misura della dignità personale, sull'orlo di una grande onda che sta per travolgere tutto. Sui flutti, come la bara in Moby Dick, galleggia un misterioso televisore, simbolo di progresso tecnologico e di radioso avvenire...",,Super ET ,10/30/02,January 1st 2008,"['Josip Broz Tito', 'Cary Grant', 'Lucky Luciano', 'Ivan Aleksandrovič Serov', ""Robespierre 'Pierre' Capponi"", 'Nicola Capponi', ""Salvatore 'Kociss' Pagano"", ""Steve 'Cemento' Zollo""]",Paperback,,9788806193195,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399710316l/9581107.jpg,3.9,['PEN Translation Prize Nominee for Shaun Whiteside (2007)'],98.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1676.0,680,Einaudi,"['488', '693', '370', '84', '41']",,"['Bologna (Italy)', 'Trieste (Italy)', 'Napoli (Italy)', 'Palm Springs, California (United States)', 'Moscow, USSR', 'Gramovac, Yugoslavia']",,['Wu Ming']
