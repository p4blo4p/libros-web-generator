King Leopold's Ghost,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Historical', 'World History', 'European History', 'Belgium', 'Race']","In the 1880s, as the European powers were carving up Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo--too long forgotten--onto the conscience of the West",,,09/21/98,September 3rd 1999,['Leopold II of Belgium'],Kindle Edition,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1532716127l/40961621.jpg,4.15,"['Mark Lynton History Prize (1999)', 'California Book Award for Nonfiction (Gold) (1998)', 'Lionel Gelber Prize (1999)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (1998)', 'Duff Cooper Prize (1999)']",632.0,10.0,,,,94.0,42340.0,442,Mariner Books,"['18339', '15563', '5879', '1537', '1022']",,"['Congo (Congo, the Democratic Republic of the)', 'Congo Free State']",,['Adam Hochschild']

He only attends school so he can stare at his beautiful classmate Kyoko from afar. But Tsuna's life takes a dramatic turn when Reborn, a suit-wearing, gun-toting baby who claims to be an Italian hit man, shows up at his house. Reborn was sent to Japan to groom Tsuna for his future life as a big Mafia boss. Tsuna doesn't believe this absurd story, so Reborn shoots Tsuna in the head with his gun. As Tsuna faces his own death, he's filled with regret that he never confessed his feelings to Kyoko...and suddenly he's overcome with supernatural powers that allow him to run off screaming to tell Kyoko how much he loves her. After five minutes, Tsuna goes back to normal. Reborn explains how his gun works: when he shoots a person in the head, if that person has regrets about her life, then she will die and be reborn, temporarily endowed with special powers that enable her to fix or solve whatever is the source of her regret. (If Reborn shoots someone who is free of regret, she would die.)Tsuna becomes Reborn's disciple, and because Reborn shoots Tsuna in the head all the time, he is constantly being reborn and growing into a stronger and better person, gradually impressing those around him and making friends.---Taken from back cover:HERE COMES REBORN!Junior high student Tsuna is a failure at school, sports, and social life.

Kick the Balls: An Offensive Suburban Odyssey,,"['Sports', 'Soccer', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'United States', 'Humor', 'Biography']","Fever Pitch meets Trainspotting in this laugh-outloud, caustic account of one man’s attempt to coach a peewee soccer team  When Alan Black was a child growing up in Glasgow, Scotland, soccer—or what he called fitba’—was the be all and end all. His experience was not the little league, boys-of-summer stuff of modern America. For him, it was life and death. Now middleaged and living in California, Alan finds himself coaching a team of eight-year-olds in his beloved sport—and nothing is going right. For a start, the kids are no good at soccer. Secondly, they’re pampered. Born and bred on the sport, Black’s hardscrabble Scottish upbringing consisted of playing tough and victory at all costs. Needless to say, his coaching methods are a far cry from the “winning isn’t everything” mentality his little leaguers have been reared with; and players and parents alike are shocked as Black attempts to transform the losing team through drills and bombast. Alone at night, watching evangelicals on TV, Black finds himself searching for some truth in the culture he finds so bizarre. And it’s with the Tigers that he feels most out of sync—faced with a mix of soft suburban children, a raft of overprotective parents, and an Iranian co-coach called Ali. Told with Black’s uproarious Scottish sensibility, Kick the Balls follows the abrasive, irreverent, and hilarious coach as he contends with a team that winds up with a zero-win record. Both a celebration of his own tough childhood and an account of one man’s navigation of an alien culture, Kick the Balls will delight fans of well-told, laugh-out-loud memoirs.",,,,June 12th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9781594630477,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1267840107l/3182869.jpg,3.38,[],96.0,1.0,,,,82.0,131.0,272,Hudson Street Press,"['26', '24', '58', '20', '3']",,[],,['Alan Black']

Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. Soundtrack,,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Video Games', 'Pop Culture', 'Japan', 'History']","Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. (1985) score redefined video game music. With under three minutes of music, Kondo put to rest an era of bleeps and bloops-the sterile products of a lab environment-replacing it with one in which game sounds constituted a legitimate form of artistic expression. Andrew Schartmann takes us through the various external factors (e.g., the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo's marketing tactics) that coalesced into a ripe environment in which Kondo's musical experiments could thrive. He then delves into the music itself, searching for reasons why our hearts still dance to the “primitive” 8-bit tunes of a bygone era.What musical features are responsible for Kondo's distinct “Mario sound”? How do the different themes underscore the vastness of Princess Peach's Mushroom Kingdom? And in what ways do the game's sound effects resonate with our physical experience of the world? These and other questions are explored within, through the lens of Kondo's compositional philosophy-one that would influence an entire generation of video game composers. As Kondo himself stated, “we [at Nintendo] were trying to do something that had never been done before.” In this book, Schartmann shows his readers how Kondo and his team not just succeeded, but heralded in a new era of video games.",33⅓ #106,,,May 21st 2015,[],Paperback,,9781628928532,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420944798l/23014513.jpg,3.67,[],94.0,1.0,,,,91.0,304.0,168,Bloomsbury Academic,"['62', '111', '105', '21', '5']",,[],,['Andrew Schartmann']

Keeping King,,"['Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary']","This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00U7LSWTSPeyton Callaghan is a fighter, a survivor, a warrior. When it was kill or be killed, she didn’t hesitate. Now, she’s the only one left standing, haunted by the ghost of a dead man and plagued with the guilt of having taken another person’s life. The upheaval of her life to start over in Rock Falls has been rocky at best, her worst nightmares and wildest desires colliding with each other. Terror tortures her nightly, breeding fear inside her dreams, and in every waking moment, she fights against the lust that threatens to drown her. Jayden King harbors secrets beneath his outward playboy demeanor. The women who warm his bed lay claim to nothing—you can’t lay claim to someone who doesn’t have a heart. His wit and charm are exquisite means of deflection and distraction from the turmoil roaring inside him. He’s hidden in plain sight, a mask of humor keeping the sadness at bay. The only real reflections of his soul are in the artwork he creates, pieces of him muraled on the skin of others. If tattoo artists could have a calling card, the etch of pain and suffering in each design would be his. Because when the lights go out and the women he’s satisfied have gone home, he’s alone with every fear he refuses to face.After suffering from a brutal attack at the hands of her roommate’s stalker, Peyton is forced to live with the object of her affection. Without intention, she breathes love into his starved heart, and although the mere thought of that terrifies him, Jayden would burn the city down to keep her safe, causalities be damned. Some people you have. Some people you hold. She can have him. She can hold him. But can she keep King? Or is it impossible for Callaghan to keep something that was never really hers to begin with?Can be read as a standalone or as part of the Rock Falls series.",Rock Falls #4,,March 2nd 2015,October 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444810558l/27193458._SY475_.jpg,4.33,[],22.0,1.0,,,,98.0,710.0,189,Amazon Digital Services,"['343', '275', '80', '8', '4']",,[],,['Anne Jolin']

Surrounded by the strip clubs, bars and body rub parlors of Yonge Street, Emanuel was lured away from his friends by a man who promised some easy money. Four days later the boy's body was discovered. He had been brutally raped and murdered, and Toronto the Good would never be the same. The murder of the Shoeshine Boy had particularly tragic resonance for the city's Portuguese community. The loss of one of their own symbolized for many how far they were from realizing their immigrant dreams. Kicking the Sky is told from the perspective of one of these children, Antonio Rebelo, a character first introduced in Barnacle Love. Twelve-year-old Antonio prizes his life of freedom and adventure. He and his best friends, Manny and Ricky, spend their days on their bikes exploring the labyrinth of laneways that link their Portuguese neighborhood to the rest of the city. But as the details of Emanuel's death expose Toronto's seedier underbelly, the boys are pulled into an adult world of danger and cruelty, secrets and lies much closer to home.

But whereas many women have been recognized for their writing on gender politics, the female voice has been all but locked out of the public discourse on race.Killing Rage speaks to this imbalance. These twenty-three essays are written from a black and feminist perspective, and they tackle the bitter difficulties of racism by envisioning a world without it. They address a spectrum of topics having to do with race and racism in the United States: psychological trauma among African Americans; friendship between black women and white women; anti-Semitism and racism; and internalized racism in movies and the media. And in the title essay, hooks writes about the ""killing rage""—the fierce anger of black people stung by repeated instances of everyday racism—finding in that rage a healing source of love and strength and a catalyst for positive change.bell hooks is Distinguished Professor of English at City College of New York.

  A riveting historical narrative of the heart-stopping events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the first work of history from mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly
The anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history—how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth—charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist—murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions—including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt. Featuring some of history's most remarkable figures, vivid detail, and page-turning action, Killing Lincoln is history that reads like a thriller. http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebre...~",Bill O'Reilly's Killing Series,First Edition,,September 27th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780805093070,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793681l/10587120.jpg,4.03,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)'],222.0,3.0,,,,92.0,92255.0,324,Henry Holt & Company,"['35943', '33919', '15123', '3698', '3572']",,[],,"[""Bill O'Reilly"", 'Martin Dugard']"

Yazıların her biri ampirik malzemeye, Kafadar'ın arşivlerde ve yazma kütüphanelerinde bulduğu kaynaklara dayanıyor, ancak tarihçinin ""uzak gözlüğü"" saydığı yöntem, paradigma ve felsefe sorunlarıyla da uğraşıyor.Kitabın genel tematiğini ""Osmanlı'da birey"" olarak adlandırabiliriz. Kafadar sunuşta, derlemenin mantığını anlatırken, özgün bir tarih felsefesinin nüvesini de ortaya koyuyor: ""Aile, klan, cemaat, ümmet içinde erime halinden birey olma haline geçiş, diye özetlenebilecek çizgisel bir hikâye yok.

Know My Name,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'True Crime', 'Autobiography', 'Adult', 'Crime']","She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford’s campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral–viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways–there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world.

Kwame Nkrumah: The Father of African Nationalism,,"['Africa', 'History', 'Ghana', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']","The first African statesman to achieve world recognition was Kwame Nkrumah (1909-1972), who became president of the new Republic of Ghana in 1960. He campaigned ceaselessly for African solidarity and for the liberation of southern Africa from white settler rule. His greatest achievement was to win the right of black peoples in Africa to have a vote and to determine their own destiny.He turned a dream of liberation into a political reality. He was the leader of Ghana who urged Africa to shed the colonial yoke and who inspired black people everywhere to seek their freedom.This revised edition of Birmingham's fine and accessible biography chronicles the public accomplishments of this extraordinary leader, who faced some of the century's most challenging political struggles over colonial transition. African nationalism, and pan-Africanism. It also relates some of the personal trials of a complex individual.As a student in America in the late 1930s, Nkrumah, shy, disorganized, but ambitious and persistent, earned four degrees in ten years. For political training he then went to England. Nkrumah found writing difficult throughout his lifetime, but once back in his African homeland, with its oral heritage, Nkrumah blossomed as a charming conversationalist, a speechmaker, and eventually a visionary and inspiring leader.Nkrumah's crusades were controversial, however, and in the 1960s he gradually lost his heroic stature both among his own people and among his fellow leaders. He lived his last years in exile.This remarkable life story, which touches on many of the issues facing modern Africa, will open a window of understanding for the general leader as well as for graduate and undergraduate classes.In this new edition, Birmingham also examines Nkrumah's exile and provides insight into the image of Nkrumah that has emerged in the light of research recently published.",,,,December 15th 1998,['Kwame Nkrumah'],Paperback,,9780821412428,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389310727l/353157.jpg,3.56,[],66.0,1.0,,,,89.0,55.0,153,Ohio University Press,"['9', '20', '20', '5', '1']",,['Ghana'],,['David Birmingham']

After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J.

King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero,,"['Biography', 'Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'African American', 'Biography Memoir', 'American', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'The United States Of America']","There were mythic sports figures before him--Jack Johnson, Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Joe DiMaggio--but when Cassius Clay burst onto the sports scene from his native Louisville in the 1950s, he broke the mold. He changed the world of sports and went on to change the world itself. As Muhammad Ali, he would become the most recognized face on the planet. Ali was a transcendent athlete and entertainer, a heavyweight Fred Astaire, a rapper before rap was born. He was a mirror of his era, a dynamic figure in the racial and cultural battles of his time. This unforgettable story of his rise and self-creation, told by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, places Ali in a heritage of great American originals. Cassius Clay grew up in the Jim Crow South and came of athletic age when boxers were at the mercy of the mob. From the start, Clay rebelled against everything and everyone who would keep him and his people down. He refused the old stereotypes and refused the glad hand of the mob. And, to the confusion and fury of white sportswriters, who were far more comfortable with the self-effacing Joe Louis, Clay came forward as a rebel, insistent on his political views, on his new religion, and, eventually, on a new name. His rebellion nearly cost him the chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. King of the World features some of the pivotal figures of the 1960s--Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, John F. Kennedy--and its pivotal events: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, the war in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali is a great hero and a beloved figure in American life. King of the World takes us back to the days when his life was a series of battles, inside the ring and out. A master storyteller at the height of his powers, David Remnick has written a book worthy of America's most dynamic modern hero.",,,1998,2000,['Muhammad Ali'],Paperback,,9780330371896,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408309614l/116826.jpg,4.27,"['Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) Nominee for Audio Nonfiction (Finalist) (1999)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography/Autobiography (1998)']",24.0,1.0,,,,98.0,3541.0,330,Picador,"['1541', '1509', '415', '59', '17']",,[],,['David Remnick']

Kabul Beauty School: An American Woman Goes Behind the Veil,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Womens', 'Travel', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Adult', 'Feminism']","Soon after the fall of the Taliban, in 2001, Deborah Rodriguez went to Afghanistan as part of a group offering humanitarian aid to this war-torn nation. Surrounded by men and women whose skills–as doctors, nurses, and therapists–seemed eminently more practical than her own, Rodriguez, a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan, despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans, and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women, who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born. With the help of corporate and international sponsors, the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen, Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers, overstepped cultural customs, and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their families’ breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques, haircutting, and makeup.Yet within the small haven of the beauty school, the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night, the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her family’s debts, the Taliban member’s wife who pursued her training despite her husband’s constant beatings. Through these and other stories, Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again, Afghan style.With warmth and humor, Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa. Kabul Beauty School is a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms, friendship, and freedom.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/01/07,April 10th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781400065592,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320448527l/316558.jpg,3.66,[],184.0,2.0,,,,89.0,22145.0,288,Random House,"['4649', '8142', '6988', '1895', '471']",,['Kabul (Afghanistan)'],,['Deborah Rodriguez']
King Kong,,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Action', 'Mystery', 'Audiobook']","Introduction by Greg BearPreface by Mark Cotta VazThe giant prehistoric gorilla King Kong is one of the most recognized images in our culture. So great is the mighty Kong’s hold on the popular imagination that his story–a gripping yarn of man versus nature, coupled with a fantastical update of the Beauty and the Beast legend–has been thrice made into a motion picture (most recently in 2005) and referenced endlessly in every medium, from books to prime-time sitcoms. Beneath King Kong’s cultural significance, however, is a tense and surprisingly tender story. One cannot help but be frightened by Kong’s uncontrollable fury, be saddened over the giant’s capture, mistreatment, and exploitation by venal showmen, or sympathize with the beast’s ill-fated affection for the down-on-her-luck starlet Ann Darrow. This Modern Library edition of a true colossus among adventure stories is reprinted from the original 1932 novelization of the movie script, and includes a Preface by Mark Cotta Vaz, the preeminent biographer of Merian C.

Spanning a period from the mid-sixties to the late nineties, the linked stories that comprise Knockemstiff feature a cast of recurring characters who are woebegone, baffled and depraved but irresistibly, undeniably real.

Climbers regard it as the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, with good reason. Four times as deadly as Everest, K2 has claimed the lives of seventy-seven climbers since 1954. In August 2008 eleven climbers died in a single thirty-six-hour period on K2–the worst single-event tragedy in the mountain's history and the second-worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Yet summiting K2 remains a cherished goal for climbers from all over the globe. Before he faced the challenge of K2 himself, Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, thought of it as ""the holy grail of mountaineering.""In K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain, Viesturs explores the remarkable history of the mountain and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time he probes K2's most memorable sagas in an attempt to illustrate the lessons learned by confronting the fundamental questions raised by mountaineering–questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and were nearly killed in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death. Fortunately, Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott' s.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs and Roberts crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit.",,,10/30/09,October 13th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780767932509,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320393028l/6309380.jpg,3.98,[],98.0,1.0,,,,96.0,5145.0,342,Crown Archetype,"['1564', '2164', '1197', '176', '44']",,[],,"['Ed Viesturs', 'David Roberts']"

Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect ""her"" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E.

Gordon Comstock has declared war on the money god; and Gordon is losing the war. Nearly 30 and ""rather moth-eaten already,"" a poet whose one small book of verse has fallen ""flatter than any pancake,"" Gordon has given up a ""good"" job and gone to work in a bookshop at half his former salary. Always broke, but too proud to accept charity, he rarely sees his few friends and cannot get the virginal Rosemary to bed because (or so he believes), ""If you have no money ... women won't love you."" On the windowsill of Gordon's shabby rooming-house room is a sickly but unkillable aspidistra--a plant he abhors as the banner of the sort of ""mingy, lower-middle-class decency"" he is fleeing in his downward flight.In Keep the Aspidistra Flying, George Orwell has created a darkly compassionate satire to which anyone who has ever been oppressed by the lack of brass, or by the need to make it, will all too easily relate. He etches the ugly insanity of what Gordon calls ""the money-world"" in unflinching detail, but the satire has a second edge, too, and Gordon himself is scarcely heroic. In the course of his misadventures, we become grindingly aware that his radical solution to the problem of the money-world is no solution at all--that in his desperate reaction against a monstrous system, he has become something of a monster himself. Orwell keeps both of his edges sharp to the very end--a ""happy"" ending that poses tough questions about just how happy it really is. That the book itself is not sour, but constantly fresh and frequently funny, is the result of Orwell's steady, unsentimental attention to the telling detail; his dry, quiet humor; his fascination with both the follies and the excellences of his characters; and his courageous refusal to embrace the comforts of any easy answer.",,,04/20/36,October 26th 2000,"['Gordon Comstock', 'Rosemary Waterlow', 'Philip Ravelston', 'Julia Comstock', 'Hermione Slater', 'Mrs Wisbeach', 'Mr Erskine']",Paperback,,9780141183725,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331244097l/9648.jpg,3.89,[],555.0,7.0,,,,94.0,15837.0,277,Penguin Books Ltd,"['4393', '6484', '3970', '824', '166']",,"['London, England']",,['George Orwell']

Led by the English adventurer and fortune hunter Allan Quartermain, they discover a frozen corpse, survive untold dangers in remote mountains and deserts, and encounter the merciless King Twala en route to the legendary hoard of diamonds.",Allan Quatermain #1,,09/28/85,December 10th 2002,"['Allan Quatermain', 'Thomas Wingfield', 'Sir Henry Curtis', 'Good', 'Umbopa/Ignosi']",Paperback,,9780812966299,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418964233l/23814.jpg,3.8,[],843.0,11.0,,,,92.0,43199.0,264,Modern Library,"['11344', '16091', '12222', '2855', '687']",,"['Zimbabwe', 'Mexico', 'South Africa']",,['H.

King Ottokar's Sceptre,,"['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Bande Dessinée', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comic Book', 'France', 'Mystery']","Tintin finds a lost briefcase and returns it to the owner, Professor Hector Alembick, who is a sigilographer, an expert on seals. He shows Tintin his collection of seals, including one which belonged to the Syldavian King Ottokar IV. Tintin then discovers that he and Alembick are under surveillance by some strange men. Tintin's flat is even bombed in an attempt to kill him. Suspecting a Syldavian connection, Tintin offers to accompany Alembick to Syldavia for research.On the plane Tintin begins to suspect his companion. The Alembick travelling with him doesn't smoke and doesn't seem to need the spectacles he wears, while the Alembick he first met smoked heavily and had very poor eyesight. During a layover, Tintin fakes a fall and grabs Alembick's beard, thinking it is false and Alembick is an imposter. However, it is (for Alembick) painfully real. Tintin decides to let the matter drop but then, while flying over Syldavia, it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out, landing in a haywagon.Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the sceptre of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia, the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to abdicate. Every year he rides in a parade during St. Vladimir's Day carrying it, while the people sing the national anthem. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning King, Muskar XII, despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick, the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing.Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen proves bad and painful for them. Later on, Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre, but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise, which allowed him to catapult it out of the castle into a nearby forest.Searching the forest, Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country, Borduria. Following them all the way to the border, he wrests the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for the taking over of Syldavia by their long-time political rival, Borduria.Tintin steals a Me-109 from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned ""Anschluss"" of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot.Meanwhile the Interior Minister informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses, acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to abdicate when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket).Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by Müsstler, leader of the Iron Guard, a local political party. The King takes action by having Müsstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response, the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border, though he stresses his own country's ""desire for peace"" and criticises Syldavia's ""strange"" behaviour.The next day is St. Vladimir's Day and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican, the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that, in a classic Ruritanian plot device, Professor Alembick is one of a pair of identical twins: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place.Tintin and Snowy return home by a flying boat with Thomson and Thompson, who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight. The reader is treated to a rare ""wink to the camera"" from Tintin, who points out their error, and they laugh about it so much that they do indeed fall into the sea as they disembark.",Tintin #8,,10/29/39,1997,"['Tintin', 'Thomson & Thompson', 'Bianca Castafiore', 'Professor Hector Alembick', 'Snowy']",Hardcover,,9780416605105,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958472l/146108.jpg,4.02,[],202.0,3.0,,,,96.0,9992.0,62,Mammoth,"['3406', '3798', '2409', '325', '54']",,['Syldavia'],,"['Hergé', 'Michael Turner', 'Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper']"

Karma Destiny or Choice,,[],"Karma - Destiny or Choice is a small effort to simplify and to explain one of the most important Law of Nature ""Karma"". I know most of us feel it boring but it might be due to lengthy or heavy content of books. This book is not a Literature Masterpiece but I have tried to convey message in the simplest language. It is not related to any religion but still related to every religion. It talks about the connection of Karma with GOD, Human Being, Relations, Anger, Helping, Soul etc. Karma plays a very crucial role at every stage of Life and Death. Sometimes we feel very helpless and sometimes we have options. If we see the fixed pattern of life then we may think that Karma is Destiny but when Life changes by our Choices then it makes us believe Karma as a choice. This book addresses and discusses the same. We will come across to a simple law of nature which is made or presented as complicated.

"King, The Complete Edition: A Comics Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr.",,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'African American', 'American', 'Spirituality', 'Art', 'Graphic Novels Comics']","This groundbreaking body of comics journalism collects for first time Anderson's entire biography of the renowned civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Over a decade in the making, the saga has been praised for its vivid recreation of one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history and for its accuracy in depicting the personal and public lives of King, from his birth to his assassination. King probes the life story of one of America's greatest public figures with an unflinchingly critical eye, casting King as an ambitious, dichotomous figure deserving of his place in history but not above moral sacrifice to get there. Anderson's expressionistic visual style is wrought with dramatic energy; panels evoke a painterly attention to detail but juxtapose with one another in such a way as to propel King's story with cinematic momentum. Anderson's successful use of the graphic novel to tell a major work of nonfiction has drawn favorable comparisons to Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale, Joe Sacco's Palestine, and Osamu Tezuka's Adolph.Ho Che Anderson's biography traces King's life from his childhood in Atlanta and his education at Booker T. Washington High School, Morehouse College, and the Crozer Theological Seminary and his centrality to the civil rights movement: his first public involvement in civil rights when, in 1955, as President of the Montgomery Improvement Association, he organized the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott; his founding of the Southern Christian leadership Conference in 1957; his help in organizing the 1966 March on Washington and his ""I Have a Dream"" speech there; his Nobel price in 1964; his voter-registration campaign that ended in the Selma-to-Montgomery Freedom March; and the tragic moment on April 4, 1968 when he was shot dead on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. King not only recreates the major events in King's public life, but chronicles the daily, rough-and-tumble, behind-the-scenes political maneuverings and strategic compromises that were required to mobilize millions of people toward a common goal. His internal debates with Ralph Abernathy and Jesse Jackson and his hardball negotiations with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson are dramatized. Anderson's achievement is not merely a political biography filled with names and dates, but a fully rounded portrait of fallible human engaged in a superhuman effort his fears, his doubts, his relationship with his wife Coretta King, and his children are compassionately and truthfully rendered.Anderson's visual approach includes the use of photographs, realistic portraiture, and expressionistic imagery alternating between stark black and white chiaroscuro and painterly full color. The dialogue is unflinchingly naturalistic and accurately reflects the moral urgency and labyrinthine political and practical complexities that King was navigating, from his deeply felt, personal commitment to a public cause to the wider political eruptions the country was experiencing. This is a respectful, unsparing, truthful biography of a man and his times that captures the moral and political gravitas of the cause as well as its human dimension.

It is the answer he gave his wife (now ex-wife) years earlier when she told him she wanted one. The loss, longing and regret that haunt the years between those two “no”s give rise to one of the most eloquent meditations ever written on the Holocaust. As Kertesz’s narrator addresses the child he couldn’t bear to bring into the world he ushers readers into the labyrinth of his consciousness, dramatizing the paradoxes attendant on surviving the catastrophe of Auschwitz.

Kopassus untuk Indonesia,,"['Military Fiction', 'Nonfiction']","Menyamar Pedagang Durian hingga Sniper AmbonIsi buku Kopassus untuk Indonesia yang diluncurkan Kopassus TNI-AD tak sembarangan. Buku dengan desain gaul itu membuka rahasia dapur korps terbaik ketiga di dunia itu, termasuk operasi intelijen bawah tanah. Seperti apa?RIDLWAN HABIB, JakartaWANITA itu bukan tentara. Gaya pakaiannya juga santai. Turun dari mobil New Honda City metalik, dia disambut hormat oleh prajurit Kopassus. “Mbak Esti ini sudah kami anggap bagian dari keluarga,” kata Letkol Farid Makruf yang menyambut Esti di Markas Komando Kopassus, Cijantung, Jakarta Timur Kamis lalu (7/1).Siang itu suasana sekitar Kesatrian Kopassus agak lengang. Sebab, pada jam dinas, semua prajurit sibuk dengan tugas masing-masing. “Sebelum mengenal mereka, saya benar-benar awam dengan dunia militer,” kata Esti yang sengaja berkunjung ke Kopassus untuk menemui Jawa Pos.Nama lengkapnya Erastiani Asikin Natanegara. Bersama penulis lain, Iwan Santosa, mereka diberi kepercayaan penuh oleh Komandan Jenderal (Danjen) Kopassus untuk menulis buku yang mulai beredar tiga minggu lalu itu.“Buku ini adalah buku resmi Kopassus pertama yang ditulis sipil dan untuk umum,” kata Letkol Farid yang ikut berbincang. Farid adalah alumnus Akmil 1991 yang juga menjadi salah satu narasumber buku. Mantan kepala staf pribadi (Kaspri) Danjen Kopassus itu juga menjadi anggota tim penyusun buku bersama 16 orang lainnya.Menurut Farid, Kopassus sengaja meminta orang luar agar tulisannya objektif. “Mbak Esti ini mulai nul puthul. Kita memang buka apa adanya. Kalau mau ditulis jelek, ya tulis saja,” kata perwira asal Pulau Madura itu.Isi buku setebal 345 halaman itu memang blak-blakan. Misalnya, cerita seorang anggota Sandhi Yudha Kopassus yang bertugas sebagai intelijen Kopassus saat masa darurat militer di Aceh pada 2003. Sersan Badri (nama samaran, Red) bertugas untuk masuk ke lingkaran utama Gerakan Aceh Merdeka.Untuk menyukseskan misinya, Badri harus menyamar sebagai pedagang durian dari Medan. Berselang setahun, sendirian, Badri menembus akses untuk mendapat kepercayaan anggota GAM. “Saat paling sulit, saat dia diminta pimpinan GAM melindungi istrinya dari kejaran pasukan TNI. Selama tiga bulan, Badri harus mencari tempat kos yang aman dari kejaran TNI yang sebenarnya temannya sendiri,” katanya.Agar jaringan intelijen sempurna dan tidak bocor, Badri tidak pernah diketahui identitasnya sebagai anggota Kopassus kecuali oleh beberapa pimpinan operasi. Meski menyamar sebagai pedagang durian, Badri menggunakan kesempatan itu untuk menyabot senjata-senjata GAM. “Misalnya, alat pembidik pada senapan-senapan GAM sengaja digeser agar tembakan mereka melenceng atau tidak tepat sasaran,” katanya.Kisah lain yang juga sengaja dibuka Kopassus adalah tim Kopassus yang bertugas mengamankan kerusuhan Ambon pada Januari 2001. Mereka bertugas di tengah-tengah kelompok Merah (Nasrani) dan kelompok Putih (muslim). Namun, ternyata, sumber kerusuhan adalah sniper (penembak jitu) gelap yang memprovokasi serangan.Narasumber dalam kisah itu adalah Wakil Asisten Intelijen Kopassus Letkol Nyoman Cantiasa yang saat itu masih berpangkat kapten. Kebetulan Nyoman pernah menceritakan kisahnya secara singkat kepada Jawa Pos beberapa bulan lalu saat tak sengaja bertemu di Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata.Dalam buku itu, dikisahkan bahwa Nyoman memerintahkan beberapa anggota tim untuk mencari asal sniper yang menembak di malam hari. Ternyata, para perusuh itu bersembunyi di Hotel Wijaya II Ambon. Mereka juga menyadap saluran HT pasukan Nyoman. Bahkan, kata sandi Nyoman saat itu yakni Arjuna 2 juga diketahui.Berdasar penghitungan matang, Nyoman akhirnya memerintahkan tim dengan seizin Pangdam Pattimura (saat itu dijabat Mayjen M. Yasa) menyerbu Hotel Wijaya. Terjadi baku tembak selama dua jam sebelum seluruh sniper dilumpuhkan. Mereka berhasil menyita beragam senjata, seperti AK 101, AK 102, SKS, MK1, SS1 , M16, dan US Karabine 30 mm.Selain Aceh dan Ambon, Kopassus membuka kisah di balik operasi-operasi di Papua, Timor Leste (dulu Timor Timur), dan berbagai lokasi lain di Indonesia. Tidak khawatir strategi Kopassus bocor ke tangan intelijen asing? Menurut Farid, kekhawatiran selalu ada. “Tapi, ibarat memasak nasi goreng. Bumbunya tidak semua orang tahu, tapi hasilnya enak. Jadi, secara detail teknisnya masih kami tutupi,” kata Farid yang sekarang menjabat kepala penerangan Kopassus itu.Tanpa bermaksud sombong, kata Farid, Kopassus mempunyai kemampuan intelijen dan antiteror yang bisa diandalkan. “Rata-rata pembebasan sandera hanya butuh tiga menit. Di Woyla dulu juga cukup tiga menit,” katanya.Saat ditanya tentang operasi Densus 88 di Temanggung yang butuh waktu 17 jam untuk meringkus Ibrohim, otak peledakan Ritz-Carlton, Farid menggeleng. “Kami tidak mau mengomentari keahlian orang lain. Cukuplah masyarakat yang menilai dengan buku. Kalau memang Kopassus jelek, ya, silakan dianggap jelek. Apa pun itu kami bangga bertugas demi negara. Itu kehormatan komando,” kata perwira yang pernah dikirim ke Sierra Leone, Afrika, itu.Masih banyak kisah lain yang ditulis Esti. Misalnya, proses perekrutan anggota Kopassus yang ketat. Seorang prajurit yang bisa diterima Kopassus harus bisa berlari 12 menit dengan jarak tempuh minimal 2.800 meter. Lalu pull up 12 kali, push up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, sit up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, renang dasar 50 meter dan tidak takut ketinggian lebih dari 15 meter.Setelah itu mereka harus ikut seleksi psikologi dan jika lolos harus menjalani pendidikan komando selama tujuh bulan. Pelatihan itu sangat berat. “Mereka punya istilah kaki tomat, yakni kaki yang melepuh karena harus long march dari Bandung ke Cilacap jalan kaki dengan jarak tempuh 500 kilometer selama 10 hari dengan beban perorangan 30 kg di pundak,” kata Esti.Kisah-kisah kegalakan pelatih juga dideskripsikan. Misalnya, galaknya Kapten Encun di Pusat Pendidikan Kopassus Batujajar. Encun yang ahli melempar pisau komando itu sudah melatih spesialisasi komando 26 tahun. “Semua pohon randu di Batujajar tidak ada yang selamat. Semua dibabat habis untuk latihan lempar pisau,” katanya.Kisah-kisah humanis anggota Kopassus saat bertugas di luar negeri juga dideskripsikan. Juga saat korps baret merah itu menjadi garda depan penanggulangan bencana alam. Wanita alumnus Sastra Tiongkok, Universitas Indonesia itu mengaku hanya butuh tiga minggu untuk menyelesaikan bukunya.“Sehari saya wawancara delapan hingga 10 prajurit, mulai pangkat terbawah sampai jenderal,” katanya. Interaksi tiga minggu itu telah mengubah pandangannya tentang Kopassus. “Mereka orang-orang aneh yang mengidap adrenalin junkie, yakni orang yang bekerja sangat prima dalam kondisi stres dan dalam tekanan tinggi,” katanya.Dia mencontohkan salah seorang bintara bernama Serka Sumardi. Orang itu istimewa karena sudah 14 kali ditugaskan di medan operasi. Sedangkan rata-rata prajurit yang lain hanya empat kali. Sumardi pernah sekali ditugaskan sebagai anggota pasukan PBB di Bosnia.“Saat saya tanya apa yang paling enak dalam penugasan, dia menjawab saat dikirim ke Bosnia karena bisa merasakan enaknya landing (mendarat). Ternyata selama 14 kali terjun operasi, dia selalu dilempar ke udara dengan parasut dan belum pernah sekalipun naik pesawat. Ini ndeso, tapi jujur,” kata Esti sambil melirik Farid.Farid tertawa lepas. “Kisah-kisah seperti itu kami harap bisa menarik minat anak muda bergabung ke Kopassus. Kalau yang tua-tua, terus terang, kami capek meyakinkan mereka,” katanya.

Written in an engaging and practical tone, this thought-provoking work seeks to transform and enrich the Christian understanding of God.

Many others cannot forget the betrayals of Imriel's mother, Melisande, who plunged their country into a bloody war that cost the lives of their fathers, brothers, and sons.To quell the unrest, Ysandre, the queen, sets her decree. She will not divide the lovers, yet neither will she acknowledge them. If they marry, Sidonie will be disinherited, losing her claim on the throne.There's only one way they can truly be together. Imriel must perform an act of faith: search the world for his infamous mother and bring her back to Terre d'Ange to be executed for treason.Facing a terrible choice, Imriel and Sidonie prepare ruefully for another long separation.

It is a court steeped in deeply laid conspiracies ... and there are many who would see the young prince dead. Some despise him out of hatred for his birth mother Melisande, who nearly destroyed the realm in her quest for power. Others because they fear he has inherited his mother's irresistible allure - and her dangerous gifts. And as he comes of age, plagued by dark yearnings, Imriel shares their fears.At the royal court, where gossip is the chosen poison and assailants wield slander instead of swords, the young prince fights character assassins while struggling with his own innermost conflicts. But when Imriel departs to study at the famed University of Tiberium, the perils he faces turn infinitely more deadly. Searching for wisdom, he finds instead a web of manipulation, where innocent words hide sinister meanings, and your lover of last night may become your hired killer before dawn. Now a simple act of friendship will leave Imriel trapped in a besieged city where the infamous Melisande is worshiped as a goddess; where a dead man leads an army; and where the prince must face his greatest test: to find his true self.",Imriel's Trilogy #1,,06/12/06,May 1st 2007,"['Phèdre nó Delaunay', 'Joscelin Verreuil', 'Melisande Shahrizai', 'Imriel de la Courcel', 'Sidonie de la Courcel', 'Alais de la Courcel', 'Hyacinthe (Jacqueline Carey)', 'Ysandre de la Courcel']",Mass Market Paperback,,9780446610025,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344265086l/153007.jpg,4.2,[],293.0,4.0,,,,96.0,19933.0,944,Grand Central Publishing,"['8877', '7075', '3239', '609', '133']",,[],,['Jacqueline Carey']

Korean Short History,,History,"As pungent and concise as his short histories of both world wars, Stokesbury's survey of ""the half war"" takes a broad view and seems to leave nothing out but the details. The first third covers the North Korean invasion of June 1950, the Pusan perimeter crisis, MacArthur's master stroke at Inchon and the intervention by Chinese forces that November. At this point, other popular histories of the war reach the three-quarter mark, ending often with a cursory summary of the comparatively undramatic three-and-a-half years required to bring the war to its ambiguous conclusion on July 27, 1953. Stokesbury renders the latter period as interesting as the operational fireworks of the first six months: the Truman-MacArthur controversy; the political limitations on U.S. air power; the need for the Americans to fight the war as cheaply as possible, due to NATO commitments; the prolonged negotiations at Panmunjom over the prisoner-exchange issue; and the effect of the war on the home front.

"Kids These Days: A Game Plan For (Re)Connecting With Those We Teach, Lead, & Love",,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Education', 'Teaching', 'Audiobook', 'Canada']","The kids are the least of our worries. Seriously. If that sounds blasphemous in a book for concerned parents and educators (and anyone, really, who worries about “kids these days”), then I am so glad you’re here. If you own a kid, work with a kid, or love a kid, you will find something inspiring in these pages. Dare I say game-changing. These words were born from the hundreds of stories of kids, their families, and their support systems I was lucky to meet as I worked across Canada and the USA. Regardless of who I met or where I met them, the message was always the same: our kids are okay ONLY if those of us holding them are okay.During the developmental years, schools—and educators—are the most significant connection point to most every child on this continent. But are the educators okay? I believe that most of the great educators want to make a difference. Many tell me, however, that they are finding it more and more difficult “these days” to love what they do. I think it’s time we did a better job of looking after them. First. Plain and simple. This book is for the educators: our teachers, bus drivers, administrators, educational assistants, librarians, administrative assistants, and custodians. And anyone who leads, loves, and supports them. If that’s you, I am so grateful you are here.

Killer Show,,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Music', 'History', 'Rock N Roll', 'Survival', 'Tragedy']","On February 20, 2003, the deadliest rock concert in U.S. history took place at a roadhouse called The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island. That night, in the few minutes it takes to play a hard-rock standard, the fate of many of the unsuspecting nightclub patrons was determined with awful certainty. The blaze was ignited when pyrotechnics set off by Great White, a 1980s heavy-metal band, lit flammable polyurethane ""egg crate"" foam sound insulation on the club's walls. In less than 10 minutes, 96 people were dead and 200 more were injured, many catastrophically. The final death toll topped out, three months later, at the eerily unlikely round number of 100.The story of the fire, its causes, and its legal and human aftermath is one of lives put at risk by petty economic decisions—by a band, club owners, promoters, building inspectors, and product manufacturers. Any one of those decisions, made differently, might have averted the tragedy. Together, however, they reached a fatal critical mass.Killer Show is the first comprehensive exploration of the chain of events leading up to the fire, the conflagration itself, and the painstaking search for evidence to hold the guilty to account and obtain justice for the victims. Anyone who has entered an entertainment venue and wondered, ""Could I get out of here in a hurry?"" will identify with concertgoers at The Station.

Mira står med sit blandede blod i centrum af konflikten. På den ene side tilhører hun sit mors folk, men hvordan kan man samarbejde med nogen der vil udslette den anden halvdel af ens slægt? Mira bliver vidne til en ondskab og lidelse hun aldrig havde troet muligt. Modvilligt begynder hun at forstå, at hendes medfødte evner som dæmonbetvinger, forpligter og at hun skal være med til at sikre at Dakja igen skal blive et godt sted at leve. Et sted hvor kærligheden igen kan få lov til at blomstre.

Čia ne tik vaizdžiai piešiami ryškūs kultūrų skirtumai, bet taip pat ieškoma jas siejančių paralelių, pasireiškiančių žmogaus santykiuose su gamta, antgamtinėmis būtybėmis, mirtimi, dievais ir pačiu savimi.

A passion to make a difference. Katie Davis left over Christmas break her senior year for a short mission trip to Uganda and her life was turned completely inside out.

Kentucky Bloodbath: Ten Bizarre Tales of Murder from the Bluegrass State,,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime']"," New From The Author of Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders and The Bundy Murders!  Think Kentucky is all about horses and mint juleps? You may revise that image with this excursion into the weird and the bizarre: from a medieval-esque murder in a small town museum to the jilted boyfriend who decided that his former girlfriend needed to die on her twenty-first birthday. And then there’s the demented son who returns home to live with his mother and stepfather, and one night in their beautiful mansion sitting atop a high bluff overlooking the Ohio River, slaughters them. Each case will keep you on the edge of your seat.  From The Author:As I began my research into past Kentucky killers and their victims, I was well aware there were a good number of very unusual homicides from the Bluegrass State, as I’d read about them over the years in newspapers accounts, heard the strange tales from relatives and friends, or watched the occasional newscasts on TV.  But these sources were never in-depth studies of the cases in question; and worse still, very often, erroneous information came forth, and it wasn’t until I began the research, using the original case files, that I’d find out what really happened. And it would be in these moments of discovery, that an accurate picture of each individual tragedy would rise and take shape from the seemingly innumerable police reports and interviews of those involved.  Indeed, many of these ten stories I’ve “unearthed” would have been lost forever had I not sought them out from the dusty archives and storage facilities scattered throughout the state; stories that would, ultimately, be destined for obscurity and eventual disposal as the decades dragged on.  Recently, one radio interviewer, contemplating their bizarre aspects, quite rightly stated how all of these Kentucky murders resembled something out of The Twilight Zone, and I quickly had to agree with his assessment. That’s the nature of these cases, and frankly, it was what I was looking for in my quest to uncover true crime in Kentucky.  From The Story ""Blood In The Moonlight"": “As Bauer led the officer to the side door where they entered the house through the kitchen, Kendrick asked if he knew who’d done this, and Bauer said, “No.” Just before stepping inside the home, Kendrick radioed the Emergency Medical Services unit, telling them to continue on to this address – code 3 – and that homicide units should be sent as well. Having notified dispatch, Kendrick then drew his weapon and entered a nightmare.""",,,,May 29th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,B00YJDTIT8,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442172624l/25632020._SY475_.jpg,3.68,[],95.0,1.0,,,,89.0,175.0,109,WildBlue Press,"['44', '57', '54', '14', '6']",,[],,['Kevin M.

Impossible, says Kevin Trudeau, the world's foremost authority on memory improvement training. There are no bad memories, only untrained memories. In order to release our natural memory, Trudeau says, we just need to learn to retrieve what we already know. As founder of the American Memory Institute, Kevin Trudeau has already helped more than one million people do just that. Each Mega Memory lesson in this book takes no more than thirty minutes per day and uses pictures, rather than the laborious word-association techniques of other memory systems, to activate our inborn memory. With this easy-to-follow system, you'll be able to instantly remember names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, speeches, and schoolwork. Even better, Trudeau's system ensures instant recall and long-term Mega Memory. All you need is the desire to unleash your Mega Memory, and you can reap all these incredible rewards! Labeled with a learning disability at an early age, Kevin Trudeau was convinced his problem was an inability to recall information. He read everything he could on memory improvement. Eventually, he developed his own program for memory retrieval and formed the American Memory Institute.

Based on extensive research in Australia and Japan, and including previously unpublished documents, Kokoda intimately relates the stories of ordinary soldiers in 'the world's worst killing field', and examines the role of commanders in sending ill-equipped, unqualified Australian troops into battles that resulted in near 100 per cent casualty rates. It was a war without mercy, fought back and forth along 90 miles (145 km) of river crossings, steep inclines and precipitous descents, with both sides wracked by hunger and disease, and terrified of falling into enemy hands. Defeat was unthinkable: the Australian soldier was fighting for his homeland against an unyielding aggressor; the Japanese ordered to fight to the death in a bid to conquer 'Greater East Asia'.

King of Hades,,['Contemporary'],"In the violent and ruthless world of Hades, a teetotaler is trying to carve a niche by himself; His quests to prove his innocence. Untangling himself from the shackles of pain & humiliations; He fought the odds with the basic instinct of a human being to prove his worthiness to those around him. “R.A.M.Z.I!....I’ll cut your heart out & throw at her feet.

Kicker,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Horror']","This is an alternate cover edition of isbn 9781477142. Based on actual experiences and official records from World War II, Kicker is a thrilling war novel of a man’s journey into hell. From the pleasant hills of Pennsylvania to the torrid jungles of Burma, Sam endures relentless enemy attacks against his unarmed aircraft while his family struggles with shortages and rationing at home. This is the tale of ""the forgotten front"", the bloody, grueling campaign to push the Japanese out of Burma.Although Kicker is an epic work of historical fiction, this World War 2 thriller is based on official military aviation history records and the real experiences of United States veterans who fought in the China-Burma-India Theater (CBI) ""the forgotten front"". Through unforgettable scenes in Burmese skies filled with monsoon storms and enemy fighter planes, Kicker tells the story of the brave Army Air Corps soldiers who risked their lives in unarmed aircraft to drop supplies to Merrill's Marauders and over 750,000 allied soldiers fighting in the perilous jungles of Burma.In effort to keep Japanese forces occupied in China, the Allies flew unarmed supply missions over the treacherous Himalayan Mountains between India and China. Their route, known as The Hump, saw the loss of over 1500 airmen and 2000 planes due to endless attacks by Japanese Zeros and some of the world's worst flying conditions. The Hump became known as ""the skyway to hell"" and ""the aluminum trail"" from the large amount of aircraft wreckage strewn across the Himalayan slopes.Allied soldiers in the jungles of Burma fought everyday just to survive. They faced elite, fearless Japanese soldiers and man-eating beasts. The Allies were surrounded by poisonous snakes, insects, and plants. These brave men suffered through monsoon seasons, so wet and humid, their uniforms rotted off their bodies as they fought fanatical Kamikaze armies through jungle and swamplands.From the Forgotten Front to the Homefront, Kicker brings you the story of America's Greatest Generation through the eyes of the men and women who would be forever haunted by their experiences.Reviews from fans of Kicker:""I could not put this book down, as the story of Sam, the young volunteer and aspiring pilot, unfolds. The author delivers his story telling with a rich back drop of historical details reflecting a thoroughly researched knowledge of the subject matter."" Elray""Would recommend this not only to history buffs and WWII aficionados (like myself) but to any reader interested in being transported to another time and place, one that shaped all of our lives and fortunes today, worldwide."" W.M. Driscoll""What an interesting story! I learned so much about heroes not mentioned in history books."" Jacquie Rhoades""History made real through the telling of one soldier's story.

One night I went to save a woman in trouble. The next thing I knew, the doorway to hell had opened and out stepped Daimons- soul-sucking vampires the likes of which I’d never seen before. Led by the son of Apollo, they are out to end the curse that has banished them all to darkness. The only problem with that is they have to kill Cassandra Peters to do it and if she dies, so dies the sun, the earth and all who dwell here. Life’s just a bowl full of cherries, ain’t it?Brought together by fate, it’s now my job to protect a daughter of the very race I have been hunting for centuries. Neither of us dares to trust the other. But if we don’t find a way to overcome our differences and to bridge thousands of years of animosity, we won’t die alone.

Using his experiences counseling individuals and couples, the author breaks down sexual taboos and openly, yet respectfully, discusses the meanings, emotions, and the hidden power of sex.With his unique anecdotal style, Rabbi Boteach illustrates each and every point, using real couples who have discovered the joys of ""kosher sex""--sex based on love, trust, and real intimacy. He profiles the two most common types of couples--best friends and passionate lovers--and suggests ways of synthesizing the best that each type has to offer.Rabbi Boteach also has advice for singles on finding the right partner; for individuals either willing to take their long-term relationship to the next level or unsure about doing so; and for married couples who may be experiencing problems in their sex life. At a time when three out of every five marriages fail, Kosher Sex will have an astonishing and positive impact.With a no-holds-barred conversational style and keen insight, Rabbi Boteach breaks all the taboos and pioneers a new approach to sex, marriage, and personal relationships. He not only brings traditional Jewish wisdom into the twentieth century but makes it relevant to everyone searching for a deeper, more meaningful, and more satisfying love life. -->",,,10/30/98,January 18th 2000,[],Paperback,,9780385494663,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320533954l/282616.jpg,3.73,[],99.0,1.0,,,,86.0,260.0,304,Harmony,"['72', '90', '62', '27', '9']",,[],,['Shmuley Boteach']

"Kristin Lavransdatter, II: The Wife",,Fiction,"“[Sigrid Undset] should be the next Elena Ferrante.” —Slate Kristin Lavransdatter interweaves political, social, and religious history with the daily aspects of family life to create a colorful, richly detailed tapestry of Norway during the fourteenth-century. The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life—her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith—profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of ""historical novels."" This new translation by Tina Nunnally—the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s—captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition. Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. Kristin Lavransdatter became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",,,,1999.0,,,1101177276,9781101177273,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5JWDGqSIRLQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sigrid Undset']

Painting a richly detailed backdrop, Undset immerses readers in the day-to-day life, social conventions, and political and religious undercurrents of the period. Now in one volume, Tiina Nunnally's award-winning definitive translation brings this remarkable work to life with clarity and lyrical beauty.  As a young girl, Kristin is deeply devoted to her father, a kind and courageous man. But when as a student in a convent school she meets the charming and impetuous Erlend Nikulaussøn, she defies her parents in pursuit of her own desires. Her saga continues through her marriage to Erlend, their tumultuous life together raising seven sons as Erlend seeks to strengthen his political influence, and finally their estrangement as the world around them tumbles into uncertainty.

The legendary annihilation in 1883 of the volcano-island of Krakatoa — the name has since become a byword for a cataclysmic disaster — was followed by an immense tsunami that killed nearly forty thousand people. Beyond the purely physical horrors of an event that has only very recently been properly understood, the eruption changed the world in more ways than could possibly be imagined. Dust swirled round the planet for years, causing temperatures to plummet and sunsets to turn vivid with lurid and unsettling displays of light. The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in Bogotá and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away.

Dover, Massachusetts, 1969. Ginny Richardson's heart was torn open when her baby girl, Lucy, born with Down Syndrome, was taken from her. Under pressure from his powerful family, her husband, Ab, sent Lucy away to Willowridge, a special school for the “feeble-minded."" Ab tried to convince Ginny it was for the best. That they should grieve for their daughter as though she were dead. That they should try to move on.

With Ginny's six-year-old son in tow, Ginny and Marsha drive to the school to see Lucy for themselves. What they find sets their course on a heart-racing journey across state lines—turning Ginny into a fugitive.For the first time, Ginny must test her own strength and face the world head-on as she fights Ab and his domineering father for the right to keep Lucy.

From the gritty streets of Los Angeles to its most protected enclaves of prestige and power to the ruthless glamour of Hollywood, a killer stalks his prey. A killer so merciless no one in his way is safe—not even the innocent.At the end of a long day battling street traffic, bike messenger Jace Damon has one last drop to make. But en route to delivering a package for one of L.A.'s sleaziest defense attorneys, he's nearly run down by a car, chased through back alleys, and shot at. Only the instincts acquired while growing up on the streets of L.A. allow him to escape with his life—and with the package someone wants badly enough to kill for. Jace returns to Lenny Lowell's office only to find the cops there, the lawyer dead, and Jace himself considered the prime suspect in the savage murder. Suddenly he's on the run from both the cops and a killer, and the key to saving himself and his ten-year-old brother is the envelope he still has—which holds a message no one wants delivered: the truth.In a city fueled by money, celebrity, and sensationalism, the murder of a bottom-feeding mouthpiece like Lenny Lowell won't make the headlines. So when detectives from the LAPD's elite robbery/homicide division show up, homicide detective Kev Parker wants to know why. Parker is on the downhill slide of a once-promising career, and he doesn't want to be reminded that he used to be one of the hotshots, working cases that made instant celebrities of everyone involved. Like the case of fading retty-boy actor Rob Cole, accused of the brutal murder of his wife, Tricia Crowne-Cole, daughter of one of the most powerful men in the city, L.A.'s latest ""crime of the century.""Robbery/Homicide has no reason to be looking at a dead small-time scumbag lawyer or chasing a bike messenger...unless there's something in it for them. Maybe Lenny Lowell had a connection to something big enough to be killed for. Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer—or the end of his career.

"Killing the Messenger: A Story of Radical Faith, Racism's Backlash, and the Assassination of a Journalist",,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Religion']","When a nineteen-year-old member of a Black Muslim cult assassinated Oakland newspaper editor Chauncey Bailey in 2007—the most shocking killing of a journalist in the United States in thirty years—the question was, Why? “I just wanted to be a good soldier, a strong soldier,” the killer told police.   A strong soldier for whom?Killing the Messenger is a searing work of narrative nonfiction that explores one of the most blatant attacks on the First Amendment and free speech in American history and the small Black Muslim cult that carried it out. Award-winning investigative reporter Thomas Peele examines the Black Muslim movement from its founding in the early twentieth century by a con man who claimed to be God, to the height of power of the movement’s leading figure, Elijah Muhammad, to how the great-grandson of Texas slaves reinvented himself as a Muslim leader in Oakland and built the violent cult that the young gunman eventually joined. Peele delves into how charlatans exploited poor African Americans with tales from a religion they falsely claimed was Islam and the years of bloodshed that followed, from a human sacrifice in Detroit to police shootings of unarmed Muslims to the horrible backlash of racism known as the “zebra murders,” and finally to the brazen killing of Chauncey Bailey to stop him from publishing a newspaper story.   Peele establishes direct lines between the violent Black Muslim organization run by Yusuf Bey in Oakland and the evangelicalism of the early prophets and messengers of the Nation of Islam.  Exposing the roots of the faith, Peele examines its forerunner, the Moorish Science Temple of America, which in the 1920s and ’30s preached to migrants from the South living in Chicago and Detroit ghettos that blacks were the world’s master race, tricked into slavery by white devils. In spite of the fantastical claims and hatred at its core, the Nation of Islam was able to build a following by appealing to the lack of identity common in slave descendants.  In Oakland, Yusuf Bey built a cult through a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery, beating and raping dozens of women he claimed were his wives and fathering more than forty children.  Yet, Bey remained a prominent fixture in the community, and police looked the other way as his violent soldiers ruled the streets. An enthralling narrative that combines a rich historical account with gritty urban reporting, Killing the Messenger is a mesmerizing story of how swindlers and con men abused the tragedy of racism and created a radical religion of bloodshed and fear that culminated in a journalist’s murder.THOMAS PEELE is a digital investigative reporter for the Bay Area News Group and the Chauncey Bailey Project. He is also a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism.  His many honors include the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award for his reporting on organized crime, and the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage.

Knowledge And Decisions,,Law,"With a new preface by the author, this reissue of Thomas Sowell's classic study of decision making updates his seminal work in the context of The Vision of the Annointed, Sowell, one of America's most celebrated public intellectuals, describes in concrete detail how knowledge is shared and disseminated throughout modern society. He warns that society suffers from an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision making—a gap that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency, but our very freedom because actual knowledge gets replaced by assumptions based on an abstract and elitist social vision f what ought to be.Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a ”landmark work” and selected for this prize ”because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.” In announcing the award, the center acclaimed Sowell, whose ”contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.”",,,,1996.0,,,0465037380,9780465037384,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oaKSswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.38,,,,,,,,,422.0,,,720.0,,,['Thomas Sowell']

Kornwolf,,"['Fiction', 'Werewolves', 'Horror', 'American Fiction', 'Novels']","Tristan Egolf's new novel is a book about the return of an old curse — the Kornwolf, a ferocious werewolf whose nocturnal rampaging becomes increasingly impossible to ignore. Kornwolf takes the reader for a good old-fashioned romp in the stubble — a journey through the slums and honky tundra of rural Pennsylvania, where nothing quite passes for good or bad, sublime or dismal, discrete or brash. And then the monotony breaks. Something — a freak of creation — is running amok in the fields. To solve the mystery, three generations of prodigal sons — a writer and hometown boy who swore he'd never come back to Penn's Woods; a middle-aged former pugilist who runs a decrepit boxing gym; and a misfit, mute, beaten-down Amish boy — are brought together by the light of a blue moon, in a town called Blue Ball. On one level this is a masterfully orchestrated, hilarious, and compelling take on the classic horror yarn, on another, Kornwolf is a social satire of suburban sprawl, closed minds, and all manners and varieties of self-satisfaction — Amish, civilian, or... other — in the best tradition of Tom Robbins and George Saunders.",,,11/06/05,November 29th 2005,['Owen Brynmore'],Paperback,,9780802170163,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347258466l/24675.jpg,3.58,[],65.0,1.0,,,,85.0,468.0,400,"Grove Press, Black Cat","['88', '181', '130', '52', '17']",,['Pennsylvania (United States)'],,['Tristan Egolf']

Known to Evil,,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Detective', 'African American', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Noir', 'Audiobook']","Leonid McGill knows something suspicious is going on as soon as the phone rings—no one calls him at this number. Alphonse Rinaldo, New York City’s ultimate fixer, the one man with a hand in every dark decision made in the five boroughs, has a problem that he needs McGill’s help to handle. What Rinaldo can’t accomplish on his own, McGill doesn’t really want to know. But Rinaldo’s not a client a Manhattan private eye can say no to, so McGill runs uptown to check on the young woman Rinaldo is worried about. McGill’s hardly pleased, but not especially surprised, when he walks into the middle of a murder scene—and, thanks to his nefarious past, winds up as the NYPD’s prime suspect.Everyone’s motives are murky in McGill’s world; that, he’s used to. What he’s not quite accustomed to is his own recent commitment to the straight and narrow, a path that still seems to lead him directly to the city’s crookedest corners and down its darkest alleys. When Rinaldo won’t let McGill drop the case, or reveal his connection to the young woman in question—simply insisting that she must be found—McGill strikes a dangerous deal with himself: he’ll find the girl, but he’s not going to hand her over until he knows all there is to know about her, and why exactly Rinaldo’s so interested.And so McGill plunges deep into contemporary New York City as only Walter Mosley can expose it, navigating an underworld that—just beneath the glitz and glamour, hidden behind the safe, clean streets—pulses with danger and violence. This is where McGill plies his trade, and it’s from this that he’s determined to protect all that he’s come to love: his family, his friends, his soul—all of which seem determined to put themselves in harm’s way.

King Lear,,"['Classics', 'Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Poetry', 'Read For School', 'Tragedy']","Shakespeare’s King Lear challenges us with the magnitude, intensity, and sheer duration of the pain that it represents. Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play-Scene-by-scene plot summaries-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books-An annotated guide to further readingEssay by Susan SnyderThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

    David Scott Kastan lucidly explores the remarkable richness and the ambitious design of King Henry IV Part 1 and shows how these complicate any easy sense of what kind of play it is. Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical, comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes extensive discussion to the play's language, indicating how its insistent economic vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention on the central relationship between value and political authority. Kastan also covers the recurrence of the word ""honor"" in the text and the role that women play.  Appendices provide the sources of 1 Henry IV, discussions of Shakespeare's metrics, and the history of the manuscript.  The appendix on casting features a doubling chart to show which characters may be played by one actor.  Photographic images of the original Q0 Fragment, which is assumed to have been printed in Peter Short's printing house in 1598, appear in the fifth appendix. Finally, a reference section provides a list of abbreviations and references, a catalog of Shakespeare’s works and works partly by Shakespeare, and citations for the modern productions mentioned in the text, other collated editions of Shakespeare's work, and other related reading.
     
    The Arden Shakespeare has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.

He also editedKing Henry IV Part 1and Much Ado About Nothing for the Arden Second Series,King Henry VandKing Henry VIIIfor Penguin, andJulius Caesarfor the Oxford Shakespeare. In the introduction to this Arden edition ofKing Henry IV Part 2, A. R. Humphreys begins by discussing the original publication of the play, the establishing of its date, and the extent to which Shakespeare took liberties with historical facts in 1and2 Henry IV. The editor proceeds to examine the relationship between the twoHenry IVplays, considering historical evidence and previous critical analysis. In the following section, Humphreys analyzes the several probable sources for the play, six of which appear in full in an appendix. Later in the introduction, the editor devotes substantial sections of his own criticism to the play's style and themes, with individual sections dedicated to Falstaff and the infamous scene of his rejection by Prince Hal. Humphreys finally dissects problems of the early texts, going over the nuances of the Quarto and Folio editions and comparing the two. Before the actual text of the play, notes are given on the particularities of this edition and its references and abbreviations.
