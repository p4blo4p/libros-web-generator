K. Eric Drexler,Radical Abundance: How a Revolution in Nanotechnology Will Change Civilization,,English,,"K. Eric Drexler is the founding father of nanotechnology -- the science of engineering on a molecular level. In Radical Abundance, he shows how rapid scientific progress is about to change our world. Thanks to atomically precise manufacturing, we will soon have the power to produce radically more of what people want, and at a lower cost. The result will shake the very foundations of our economy and environment. Already, scientists have constructed prototypes for circuit boards built of millions of precisely arranged atoms.

Her foster parents have the emotional aptitude of robots and her classmates barely acknowledge her existence. About to turn eighteen and feeling like a social pariah, she is desperate to connect with someone. Anyone.When Evangeline meets Sofie after literally stumbling upon her café, she believes she’s found that connection. Willing to do anything to keep it, she accepts a job as Sofie’s assistant and drops everything to fly to Manhattan, where she is thrust into a luxurious world of Prada, diamonds, and limitless cash.With such generosity and kindness, it’s easy for Evangeline to dismiss certain oddities... like Sofie’s erratic and sometimes violent behavior, and the monstrous guard dogs. She’s even willing to dismiss her vivid dreams of mob-style murders, beautiful homeless people living in caves, and white-eyed demons that haunt her each night as figments of her imagination—especially when one of those figments is the gorgeous Caden. When she wakes up with bite marks on her neck, the fairy tale quickly turns into a nightmare. She slowly unravels the mystery surrounding Sofie and friends, and the reality of the bites and the “dreams.” What she discovers is far more mysterious and terrible than anything she could have imagined.In a world where everyone has motive to lie for personal gain, Evangeline must decide which deception is least likely to get her killed.",Causal Enchantment #1,,05/25/11,May 27th 2011 ,[],Kindle Edition,"['Paranormal', 'Young Adult', 'Vampires', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Magic', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Supernatural', 'Witches']",,9780986915505,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372240623l/11549777.jpg,3.8,[],195.0,2.0,,11549777-anathema,,,,,88.0,4505.0,286,,,"['1385', '1587', '997', '337', '199']",,,[],,

But underneath that exterior is a little girl hanging onto the last words her father ever spoke to her. “Make me proud,” he had said. She promised she would...and she’s done her best over the past seven years with every choice, with every word, with every action.Livie walks into Princeton with a solid plan, and she’s dead set on delivering on it: Rock her classes, set herself up for medical school, and meet a good, respectable guy that she’s going to someday marry. What isn’t part of her plan are Jell-O shots, a lovable, party animal roommate she can’t say ‘no’ to, and Ashton, the gorgeous captain of the men’s rowing team. Definitely him. He’s an arrogant ass who makes Livie’s usually non-existent temper flare and everything she doesn’t want in a guy. Worse, he’s best friends and roommates with Connor, who happens to fits Livie’s criteria perfectly. So why does she keep thinking about Ashton?As Livie finds herself facing mediocre grades, career aspirations she no longer thinks she can handle, and feelings for Ashton that she shouldn’t have, she’s forced to let go of her last promise to her father and, with it, the only identity that she knows.",Ten Tiny Breaths #2,,,June 11th 2013,"['Olivia Cleary', 'Ashton Henley']",ebook,"['New Adult', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'College', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Abuse', 'Chick Lit', 'Fiction', 'Drama']",,9781476740485,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380903726l/17302495.jpg,4.27,[],665.0,7.0,,17302495-one-tiny-lie,,,,,96.0,34310.0,279,,Atria Books,"['16689', '11827', '4487', '953', '354']",,,"['Miami, Florida (United States)']",,

K.A. Tucker (Goodreads Author),The Simple Wild,,English,,"Calla Fletcher wasn't even two when her mother took her and fled the Alaskan wild, unable to handle the isolation of the extreme, rural lifestyle, leaving behind Calla’s father, Wren Fletcher, in the process. Calla never looked back, and at twenty-six, a busy life in Toronto is all she knows. But when Calla learns that Wren’s days may be numbered, she knows that it’s time to make the long trip back to the remote frontier town where she was born.She braves the roaming wildlife, the odd daylight hours, the exorbitant prices, and even the occasional—dear God—outhouse, all for the chance to connect with her father: a man who, despite his many faults, she can’t help but care for. While she struggles to adjust to this rugged environment, Jonah—the unkempt, obnoxious, and proud Alaskan pilot who helps keep her father’s charter plane company operational—can’t imagine calling anywhere else home. And he’s clearly waiting with one hand on the throttle to fly this city girl back to where she belongs, convinced that she’s too pampered to handle the wild.Jonah is probably right, but Calla is determined to prove him wrong. Soon, she finds herself forming an unexpected bond with the burly pilot. As his undercurrent of disapproval dwindles, it’s replaced by friendship—or perhaps something deeper? But Calla is not in Alaska to stay and Jonah will never leave. It would be foolish of her to kindle a romance, to take the same path her parents tried—and failed at—years ago.

K.J. Soze (Goodreads Author),The Message for the Last Days,,English,,"This award winning book examines the biblical quest to obtain eternal life. It guides readers through the journey in a step by step progression, from ancient prophecies to their final fulfillment. The Message for the Last Days maps out God's intersection of our temporary condition to the eternal.The future is revealed by understanding the past; where history and mystery are intertwined.How can we know what the future holds if we don't understand the past? This question is at the heart of this book as much of modern Christian culture has lost its roots. The crux of the book is derived from consistent biblical interpretation methods to find hard truths about our fate mentioned in the Bible.Topics include answers to these questions:Why is the Christian Church so divided with many different denominations and independent Churches? Isn’t there just one true Church?How did the modern Church get so far removed from early Church beliefs as clearly stated in the New Testament and by the early Church fathers?What are the original prophecies in the Old Testament about the end times and how are they repeated in the New Testament?Does the nation of Israel have anything to do with end times? What is the true meaning of the gospel and salvation?These questions are answered by a thorough examination of various interpretation methods. This book explains six different biblical interpretation options then reveals a unified approach to understanding the Bible.Books and articles by KJ Soze cut across various denomination lines to help find unity and clarity for those who may hold differing interpretations.The Message for the Last Days provides detailed historical research of complex topics, such as end times and the afterlife, then condenses the results into a compact format to save time for those interested in biblical studies. The process is an integration of scriptural references, concordances, topical studies and commentaries into a unique package to help clarify the Bible's message about the future.",,,,June 17th 2019,[],Paperback,"['Contemporary', 'Epic', 'Book Club', 'Christian', 'Drama']",,0578530805,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1561206232l/52074436._SX318_SY475_.jpg,4.3,[],1555.0,17.0,,52074436-the-message-for-the-last-days,,,,,95.0,446.0,372,,K.J.

Kafū Nagai,Amerika Monogatari,,,,"Nagai Kafu is one of the greatest modern Japanese writers, but until now his classic collection, American Stories, based on his sojourn from Japan to Washington State, Michigan, and New York City in the early years of the twentieth century, has never been available in English. Here, with a detailed and insightful introduction, is an elegant translation of Kafu's perceptive and lyrical account.Like de Tocqueville a century before, Kafu casts a fresh, keen eye on vibrant and varied America -- world fairs, concert halls, and college campuses; saloons, the immigrant underclass, and red-light districts. Many of his vignettes involve encounters with fellow Japanese or Chinese immigrants, some of whom are poorly paid laborers facing daily discrimination. The stories paint a broad landscape of the challenges of American life for the poor, the foreign born, and the disaffected, peopled with crisp individual portraits that reveal the daily disappointments and occasional euphorias of modern life.Translator Mitsuko Iriye's introduction provides important cultural and biographical background about Kafu's upbringing in rapidly modernizing Japan, as well as literary context for this collection. In the first story, ""Night Talk in a Cabin,"" three young men sailing from Japan to Seattle each reveal how poor prospects, shattered confidence, or a broken heart has driven him to seek a better life abroad. In ""Atop the Hill,"" the narrator meets a fellow Japanese expatriate at a small midwestern religious college, who slowly reveals his complex reasons for leaving behind his wife in Japan. Caught between the pleasures of America's cities and the stoicism of its small towns, he wonders if he can ever return home.Kafu plays with the contradictions and complexities of early twentieth-century America, revealing the tawdry, poor, and mundane underside of New York's glamour in ""Ladies of the Night"" while celebrating the ingenuity, cosmopolitanism, and freedom of the American city in ""Two Days in Chicago."" At once sensitive and witty, elegant and gritty, these stories provide a nuanced outsider's view of the United States and a perfect entrance into modern Japanese literature.",,,06/30/51,Expected publication: 65535,[],,"['Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Travel']",,9784003104262,,,3.68,[],98.0,1.0,,8542898-amerika-monogatari,,,,,94.0,34.0,285,,Iwanami Shoten,"['5', '15', '12', '2', '0']",,,[],,

Kage Baker,The Anvil of the World,,English,,"Kage Baker's stories and novels of the mysterious organization that controls time travel, The Company, have made her famous in SF. So has her talent for clever dialogue, and pointed social commentary with a light touch.The Anvil of the World is her first fantasy novel, a journey across a fantastic landscape filled with bizarre creatures, human and otherwise. It is the tale of Smith, of the large extended family of Smiths, of the Children of the Sun. They are a race given to blood feuds, and Smith was formerly an extremely successful assassin. Now he has wearied of his work and is trying to retire in another country, to live an honest life in obscurity in spite of all those who have sworn to kill him.His problems begin when he agrees to be the master of a caravan from the inland city of Troon to the seaside city of Salesh. The caravan is dogged with murder, magic, and the brooding image of the Master of the Mountain, a powerful demon, looking down from his mountain kingdom upon the greenlands and the travelers passing below. In Salesh, Smith becomes an innkeeper, but on the journey he befriended the young Lord Ermenwyr, a decadent demonic half-breed. Each time Ermenwyr turns up, he brings new trouble with him.The outgrowth of stories Baker has been writing since childhood, as engaging as Tolkien and yet nothing like him, Smith's adventure is certainly the only fantasy on record with a white-uniformed nurse, gourmet cuisine, one hundred and forty-four glass butterflies, and a steamboat. This is a book filled with intrigue, romance, sudden violence, and moments of emotional impact, a cast of charming characters, and echoes of the fantasy tradition from Lord Dunsany and Fritz Leiber to Jack Vance and Roger Zelazny.",Lord Ermenwyr #1,,08/23/03,December 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Steampunk', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Humor', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Time Travel']",,9780765349071,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312054576l/297815.jpg,3.89,['Mythopoeic Fantasy Award Nominee for Adult Literature (2005)'],172.0,2.0,,297815.The_Anvil_of_the_World,,,,,93.0,1914.0,352,,Tor Fantasy,"['553', '766', '455', '103', '37']",,,[],,

While most of Gibran's early writings were in Syriac and Arabic, most of his work published after 1918 was in English. Gibran also took part in the New York Pen League, also known as the ""immigrant poets"" (al-mahjar), alongside other important Lebanese American authors such as Ameen Rihani (""the father of Lebanese American literature""), Mikhail Naimy and Elia Abu Madi. Gibran's best-known work is The Prophet, a book composed of 26 poetic essays, first written in English in 1923. The Prophet remains famous to this day, having been translated into more than 20 languages. Other works in English include: Spirits Rebellious, (1908), The Broken Wings (1912), A Tear and a Smile (1914), The Forerunner (1920), Sand and Foam (1926), Jesus the Son of Man (1928), The Earth Gods (1929), The Wanderer (1932) and The Garden of the Prophet (1933).",,The Kahlil Gibran Pocket Library,01/30/32,February 21st 1995,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Philosophy', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Spirituality', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'Novels', 'Lebanon']",,9780679439233,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562947478l/115673.jpg,3.73,[],150.0,2.0,,115673.The_Wanderer,,,,,90.0,2399.0,100,,Knopf,"['586', '878', '695', '193', '47']",,,[],,

Kai Bird (Goodreads Author),The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames,,English,,"The Good Spy is Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Kai Bird’s compelling portrait of the remarkable life and death of one of the most important operatives in CIA history – a man who, had he lived, might have helped heal the rift between Arabs and the West. On April 18, 1983, a bomb exploded outside the American Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people.  The attack was a geopolitical turning point. It marked the beginning of Hezbollah as a political force, but even more important, it eliminated America’s most influential and effective intelligence officer in the Middle East – CIA operative Robert Ames.  What set Ames apart from his peers was his extraordinary ability to form deep, meaningful connections with key Arab intelligence figures. Some operatives relied on threats and subterfuge, but Ames worked by building friendships and emphasizing shared values – never more notably than with Yasir Arafat’s charismatic intelligence chief and heir apparent Ali Hassan Salameh (aka “The Red Prince”). Ames’ deepening relationship with Salameh held the potential for a lasting peace.  Within a few years, though, both men were killed by assassins, and America’s relations with the Arab world began heading down a path that culminated in 9/11, the War on Terror, and the current fog of mistrust. Bird, who as a child lived in the Beirut Embassy and knew Ames as a neighbor when he was twelve years old, spent years researching The Good Spy.  Not only does the book draw on hours of interviews with Ames’ widow, and quotes from hundreds of Ames’ private letters, it’s woven from interviews with scores of current and former American, Israeli, and Palestinian intelligence officers as well as other players in the Middle East “Great Game.” What emerges is a masterpiece-level narrative of the making of a CIA officer, a uniquely insightful history of twentieth-century conflict in the Middle East, and an absorbing hour-by-hour account of the Beirut Embassy bombing.  Even more impressive, Bird draws on his reporter’s skills to deliver a full dossier on the bombers and expose the shocking truth of where the attack’s mastermind resides today.",,,,May 20th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Espionage', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'War', 'American History', 'Historical', 'True Crime']",,9780307889751,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404477516l/18373198.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2014)'],78.0,1.0,,18373198-the-good-spy,,,,,94.0,2969.0,448,,Crown,"['832', '1292', '661', '140', '44']",,,[],,
Kai Meyer (Goodreads Author),Arcadia Awakens,,English,,"To New Yorker Rosa Alcantara, the exotic world of Sicily, with its network of Mafia families and its reputation for murder and intrigue, is just that—exotic, and wholly unknown. But when tragedy strikes, she must travel there, to her family’s ancestral home, where her sister and aunt have built their lives and where centuries of family secrets await her. Once there, Rosa wastes no time falling head over heels for Alessandro Carnevare, the son of a Sicilian Mafia family, whose handsome looks and savage grace both intrigue and unsettle her. But their families are sworn enemies, and her aunt and sister believe Alessandro is only using Rosa to infiltrate the Alcantara clan. And when Rosa encounters a tiger one night—a tiger with very familiar eyes—she can no longer deny that neither the Carnevares nor the Alcantaras are what they seem.Ancient myths brought to life in the Sicilian countryside, dangerous beasts roaming the hills, and a long history of familial bloodlust prove to Rosa that she can’t trust anyone—not even her own family.

Kaira Rouda (Goodreads Author),"Here, Home, Hope",,English,,"Kelly Johnson becomes restless in her thirty-ninth year. An appetite for more forces her to take stock of her middling middle-American existence and her neighbors' seemingly perfect lives. Her marriage to a successful attorney has settled into a comfortable routine, and being the mother of two adorable sons has been rewarding. But Kelly's own passions lie wasted. She eyes with envy the lives of her two best friends, Kathryn and Charlotte, both beautiful, successful businesswomen who seem to have it all. Kelly takes charge of her life, devising a midlife makeover plan. From page one, Kelly's witty reflections, self-deprecating humor, and clever tactics in executing that plan--she places Post-it notes all over her house and car--will have readers laughing out loud. The next instant, however, they might rant right along with Kelly as her commitment to a sullen, anorexic teenager left on her doorstep tries her patience or as she deflects the boozy advances of a divorced neighbor. Readers will need to keep the tissue box handy, too, as Kelly repairs the damage she inflicted on a high school friend; realizes how deeply her husband, Patrick, understands and loves her; and ultimately grows into a woman empowered by her own blend of home and career.

"Kakuzō Okakura, Elise Grilli (Foreword)",The Book of Tea,,English,,"Now available in a gorgeous hardcover slipcase edition, this ""object d'art"" will be sure to add grace and elegance to tea shelves, coffee tables and bookshelves. A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years, The Book of Tea Classic Edition will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.In 1906 in turn-of-the-century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston's most notorious socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty—and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was more than capable of expressing to Westerners the nuances of tea and the Japanese Tea Ceremony.In The Book of Tea Classic Edition, he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that tea-induced simplicity affected the culture, art and architecture of Japan.Nearly a century later, Kakuzo's The Book of Tea Classic Edition is still beloved the world over, making it an essential part of any tea enthusiast's collection. Interwoven with a rich history of Japanese tea and its place in Japanese society is a poignant commentary on Asian culture and our ongoing fascination with it, as well as illuminating essays on art, spirituality, poetry, and more. The Book of Tea Classic Edition is a delightful cup of enlightenment from a man far ahead of his time.",,Classic Edition,10/29/06,1989,[],Hardcover Slipcased ,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Japan', 'History', 'Classics', 'Tea', 'Japanese Literature', 'Art', 'Food', 'Asia']",,9780804800693,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492192349l/904538._SY475_.jpg,3.85,[],249.0,3.0,,904538.The_Book_of_Tea,,,,,91.0,9981.0,133,,Tuttle,"['2961', '3637', '2488', '686', '209']",,,"['Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Japan']",,

The founder of Adbusters magazine, Lasn aims to stop the branding of America by changing the way information flows; the way institutions wield power; the way television stations are run; and the way the food, fashion, automobile, sports, music, and culture industries set agendas. With a courageous and compelling voice, Lasn deconstructs the advertising culture and our fixation on icons and brand names. And he shows how to organize resistance against the power trust that manages the brands by ""uncooling"" consumer items, by ""dermarketing"" fashions and celebrities, and by breaking the ""media trance"" of our TV-addicted age.A powerful manifesto by a leading media activist, Culture Jam lays the foundations for the most significant social movement of the early twenty-first century -- a movement that can change the world and the way we think and live.",,,11/06/99,November 7th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Cultural', 'Cultural Studies', 'Business', 'Pop Culture', 'Counter Culture']",,9780688178055,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441048554l/280773._SY475_.jpg,3.61,[],47.0,1.0,,280773.Culture_Jam,,,,,87.0,1761.0,272,,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['378', '602', '556', '166', '59']",,,[],,

BOOK DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S HERO is the continuing romantic journey of Adam and Karla, which began in MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY'S ANGEL. Retired Marine Master Sergeant Adam Montague has battled through four combat zones, but now finds himself retreating from Karla Paxton, who has declared war on his heart. With a significant age difference, he feels he should be her guardian and protector, not her lover. But Karla's knack for turning up in his bed at inopportune times is killing his resolve to do the right thing. Karla isn't the young girl he rescued nine years earlier—something his body reminds him of every chance it gets. Their age difference is only part of the problem. Fifty-year-old Adam has been a collector of lost and vulnerable souls most of his life, but a secret he has run from for more than three decades has kept him emotionally unable to admit love for anyone. Will Karla be able to break through the defenses around his heart and help him put the ghosts from his past to rest? In her all-out war to get Adam to surrender his heart, will the strong-willed Goth singer offer herself as his submissive and, if so, at what cost to herself?

Kallypso Masters (Goodreads Author),Nobody's Perfect,,English,,"Why would someone choose the BDSM lifestyle of consensual bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sado-masochism as a means to heal from a traumatic and abusive past? DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S PERFECT is the continuing story of Savannah Gentry (now Savi Baker) and Damian Orlando from MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY’S ANGEL (Rescue Me Saga #1) and NOBODY'S HERO (#2). Savannah/Savi escaped eleven years of abuse at the hands of her father and finally made a safe life for herself and her daughter. But when her father once again threatens her peace of mind—and her daughter’s safety—Savi runs to Damian Orlando for protection. Eight years earlier as Savannah, she shared one perfect day with Damian that changed both their young lives and resulted in a secret she no longer can hide. But being with Damian reawakens repressed memories and feelings she wants to keep buried. After witnessing a scene with Damian on Savi's first night at his private club, however, she begins to wonder if he could help her regain control of her life and reclaim her sexuality and identity. Damian, a wounded warrior, has had his own dragons to fight in life, but has never forgotten Savannah. He will lay down his life to protect her and her daughter, but doesn’t believe he can offer more than that. She deserves a whole man, something he can never be after a firefight in Iraq. Damian has turned to SM to regain control of his life and emotions and fulfills the role of Service Top to “bottoms” at the club. However, he could never deliver those services to Savi, who needs someone gentle and loving, not the man he has become. Will two wounded survivors find love and healing in each other’s arms?

About 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered with water, but only about 1 percent of the water on Earth's surface is usable by living things (groundwater and surface water).

"Kanji Hanawa, Meredith McKinney (Translation)",The Chronicles of Lord Asunaro,,,,"A Japanese tale - not about daring ninja or battling samurai - but a hero with a very different penchant. Based on an actual historical figure, the Akutagawa-nominated master short story writer, Kanji Hanawa, takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery, as Lord Asunaro inherits his own Japanese fiefdom and grapples with his role and ultimate legacy. Hanawa provides us with an unusual and entertaining perspective on the psychology of change within Japan when it was still ruled by its men of steel, samurai and shoguns.As Japan emerges from the conflict-ridden era dominated by infamous warlords into a golden age of plenty, a young lord - heir to a vast domain and incumbent ruler of all he surveys - lives deep within a spiralling castle.From the pen of Hanawa, this cleverly spun tale features our young Lord Asunaro, a 'warlord' who doesn't fit the brave samurai stereotype, as he faces a modernising world where learning now outvalues military prowess. Carrying the legacy of his bloodline, he is compelled to find his place among the great figures of his ancestors.Hanawa's charming story, The Chronicles of Lord Asunaro is translated by Meredith McKinney, and takes the reader back to life and leadership in feudal Japan - while also exploring universal themes of legacy, inheritance, expectations, the weight of history and the psychology of change.Red Circle Minis: Original, Short and Compelling ReadsThe Chronicle of Lord Asunaro is part of Red Circle Minis, a series of short captivating books by Japan's finest contemporary writers that brings the narratives and voices of Japan together as never before.

Emma Edmonds cut off her hair and assumed the identity of a man to enlist as a Union private, witnessing the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. The beautiful widow, Rose O’Neale Greenhow, engaged in affairs with powerful Northern politicians to gather intelligence for the Confederacy, and used her young daughter to send information to Southern generals. Elizabeth Van Lew, a wealthy Richmond abolitionist, hid behind her proper Southern manners as she orchestrated a far-reaching espionage ring, right under the noses of suspicious rebel detectives.Using a wealth of primary source material and interviews with the spies’ descendants, Abbott seamlessly weaves the adventures of these four heroines throughout the tumultuous years of the war. With a cast of real-life characters including Walt Whitman, Nathaniel Hawthorne, General Stonewall Jackson, detective Allan Pinkerton, Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and Emperor Napoleon III, Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy draws you into the war as these daring women lived it.Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy contains 39 black & white photos and 3 maps.",,,07/01/14,September 2nd 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Civil War', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'War', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Feminism', 'Womens']",,9780062092892,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395710606l/18679391.jpg,3.74,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2014)'],65.0,1.0,,18679391-liar-temptress-soldier-spy,,,,,90.0,13010.0,513,,Harper,"['2999', '5353', '3390', '836', '432']",,,[],,
Karen Abbott (Goodreads Author),American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare: The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee,,English,,"With the critically acclaimed Sin in the Second City, bestselling author Karen Abbott “pioneered sizzle history” (USA Today). Now she returns with the gripping and expansive story of America’s coming-of-age—told through the extraordinary life of Gypsy Rose Lee and the world she survived and conquered.America in the Roaring Twenties. Vaudeville was king. Talking pictures were only a distant flicker. Speakeasies beckoned beyond dimly lit doorways; money flowed fast and free. But then, almost overnight, the Great Depression leveled everything. When the dust settled, Americans were primed for a star who could distract them from grim reality and excite them in new, unexpected ways. Enter Gypsy Rose Lee, a strutting, bawdy, erudite stripper who possessed a preternatural gift for delivering exactly what America needed. With her superb narrative skills and eye for compelling detail, Karen Abbott brings to vivid life an era of ambition, glamour, struggle, and survival. Using exclusive interviews and never-before-published material, she vividly delves into Gypsy’s world, including her intensely dramatic triangle relationship with her sister, actress June Havoc, and their formidable mother, Rose, a petite but ferocious woman who seduced men and women alike and literally killed to get her daughters on the stage.American Rose chronicles their story, as well as the story of the four scrappy and savvy showbiz brothers from New York City who would pave the way for Gypsy Rose Lee’s brand of burlesque. Modeling their shows after the glitzy, daring reviews staged in the theaters of Paris, the Minsky brothers relied on grit, determination, and a few tricks that fell just outside the law—and they would shape, and ultimately transform, the landscape of American entertainment.With a supporting cast of such Jazz- and Depression-era heavyweights as Lucky Luciano, Harry Houdini, FDR, and Fanny Brice, Karen Abbott weaves a rich narrative of a woman who defied all odds to become a legend—and whose sensational tale of tragedy and triumph embodies the American Dream.",,,01/01/10,December 28th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Womens', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Memoir', 'Adult']",,9781400066919,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320408989l/8201605.jpg,3.43,[],55.0,1.0,,8201605-american-rose,,,,,81.0,4821.0,353,,Random House,"['854', '1524', '1538', '666', '239']",,,"['New York City, New York (United States)']",,

Karen Ann Hopkins (Goodreads Author),Lamb to the Slaughter,,English,,"The death of a teenage Amish girl in a cornfield looks like an accident, but sheriff Serenity Adams suspects foul play. To solve the murder, she must investigate the nearby Amish community with the help of a man who was shunned years ago. Lamb to the Slaughter is a story about the intertwining lives of three unlikely people in an Indiana Amish Community and the devastating results when a rebellious teenage girl is found shot to death in a corn field during the harvest. Serenity Adams is the newly elected young sheriff in the country town of Blood Rock and besides dealing with the threatening behavior of her predecessor, she now has a dead Amish girl on her plate. At first glance, the case seems obvious. The poor girl was probably accidentally shot during hunting season, but when the elders of the Amish community and even the girl’s parents react with uncaring subdued behavior, Serenity becomes suspicious. As she delves deeper into the secretive community that she grew up beside, she discovers a gruesome crime from the past that may very well be related to the Amish girl’s shooting. Serenity enlists the help of the handsome bad-boy building contractor, Daniel Bachman, who left the Amish when he was nineteen and has his own dark reasons to help the spunky sheriff solve the crime that the family and friends who shunned him are trying desperately to cover up. Serenity’s persistence leads her to a stunning discovery that not only threatens to destroy her blossoming romance with Daniel, but may even take her life in the end.",Serenity's Plain Secrets #1,,03/01/14,March 14th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Mystery', 'Amish', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Contemporary', 'Amazon', 'Adult']",,B00J0LY146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441200630l/22172801._SY475_.jpg,4.06,[],100.0,1.0,,22172801-lamb-to-the-slaughter,,,,,94.0,3643.0,293,,Karen Ann Hopkins,"['1418', '1327', '665', '169', '64']",,,[],,

Karen Armstrong,Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet,,English,,"Muhammad was born in 570 C.E. Over the course of the following sixty years, he built a thriving spiritual community and laid out the foundations of a religion that has changed the course of world history. There is more historical data available about his life than that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet, particularly in the West, his is a consistently misunderstood story.An acclaimed authority on religious and spiritual issues, Karen Armstrong offers a balanced portrait of this revered figure. Through comparison with other prophets and mystics, she illuminates Muhammad's spiritual ideas; she uses the facts of his life, from which Muslims have drawn instruction for centuries, to make the tenets of Islam clear and accessible for modern readers of all faiths.

Karen Armstrong,The Case for God,,English,,"Moving from the Paleolithic age to the present, Karen Armstrong details the great lengths to which humankind has gone in order to experience a sacred reality that it called by many names, such as God, Brahman, Nirvana, Allah, or Dao. Focusing especially on Christianity but including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Chinese spiritualities, Armstrong examines the diminished impulse toward religion in our own time, when a significant number of people either want nothing to do with God or question the efficacy of faith. Why has God become unbelievable? Why is it that atheists and theists alike now think and speak about God in a way that veers so profoundly from the thinking of our ancestors?Answering these questions with the same depth of knowledge and profound insight that have marked all her acclaimed books, Armstrong makes clear how the changing face of the world has necessarily changed the importance of religion at both the societal and the individual level. And she makes a powerful, convincing argument for drawing on the insights of the past in order to build a faith that speaks to the needs of our dangerously polarized age. Yet she cautions us that religion was never supposed to provide answers that lie within the competence of human reason; that, she says, is the role of logos. The task of religion is “to help us live creatively, peacefully, and even joyously with realities for which there are no easy explanations.” She emphasizes, too, that religion will not work automatically. It is, she says, a practical discipline: its insights are derived not from abstract speculation but from “dedicated intellectual endeavor” and a “compassionate lifestyle that enables us to break out of the prism of selfhood.”",,,01/01/01,September 22nd 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Faith', 'Science', 'Christian']",,9780307269188,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320462485l/6359293.jpg,3.79,[],97.0,1.0,,6359293-the-case-for-god,,,,,87.0,8195.0,406,,Knopf,"['2735', '2602', '1754', '596', '508']",,,[],,

  Dorina Basarab is a dhampir—half-human, half-vampire. Subject to uncontrollable rages, most dhampirs live very short, very violent lives. But so far, Dory has managed to maintain her sanity by unleashing her anger on those demons and vampires who deserve killing... 
Dory is used to fighting hard and nasty. So when she wakes up in a strange scientific lab with a strange man standing over her, her first instinct is to take his head off. Luckily, the man is actually the master vampire Louis-Cesare, so he’s not an easy kill. It turns out that Dory had been working with a Vampire Senate task force on the smuggling of magical items and weaponry out of Faerie when she was captured and brought to the lab. But when Louis-Cesare rescues her, she has no memory of what happened to her.

Karen Hesse,Witness,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewKaren Hesse's Newbery Award-winning skills are put to great use in Witness, a poetic tale about friendship, fanaticism, and the deadly undercurrents of racial prejudice. The story takes place in a small Vermont town in the year 1924, revealing the devastating impact of the Ku Klux Klan on this pastoral, insular community. At the heart of the tale are two motherless girls who come to the attention of the newly formed Klan: 12-year-old Leanora Sutter, who is black, and 6-year-old Esther Hirsch, who is Jewish. Hesse tells her story, which is based on real events, through the eyes of 11 different characters. Each point of view is expressed in poetic form, but with a stark clarity of difference that makes the voices unique and identifiable. There is a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose sermons reveal him as a zealot and whose actions brand him as a hypocrite. There is a middle-aged farm woman named Sara who takes Esther under her wing despite the warnings of her neighbors, trying to help the child understand why the Klan has marked her and her widowed father as targets for their hatred. Esther's only other friend is Leanora, who is about to learn some harsh lessons on tolerance and hatred herself at the hands of the Klan. And linking them all together is 18-year-old Merlin Van Tornhout, a young man struggling to fit in with the adult world and determine for himself the difference between right and wrong. The remaining characters who circle the periphery of this core group reflect the various mind-sets and biases that were common during this era of fear and persecution, even in a setting as bucolic as the Vermont countryside.Hesse weaves real historic events into her tale, such as the murder trial of the infamous kidnappers Leopold and Loeb, giving the work a definite period flavor. Using prose that is both sparse and powerful, she builds the tension with a slow crescendo of inevitability that ends in violence, but also offers up an unforgettable lesson on the true power of friendship and acceptance.

Karen Kingsbury (Goodreads Author),Beyond Tuesday Morning,,English,,"The hope-filled sequel to the bestselling One Tuesday Morning In this new novel by Karen Kingsbury, three years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York City. Jamie Bryan, widow of a firefighter who lost his life on that terrible day, has found meaning in her season of loss by volunteering at St. Paul’s, the memorial chapel across the street from where the Twin Towers once stood. Here she meets a daily stream of people touched by the tragedy, including two men with whom she feels a connection. One is a firefighter also changed by the attacks, the other a police officer from Los Angeles. But as Jamie gets to know the police officer, she is stunned to find out that he is the brother of Eric Michaels, the man with the uncanny resemblance to Jamie’s husband, the man who lived with her for three months after September 11. Eric is the man she has vowed never to see again. Certain she could not share even a friendship with his brother, Jamie shuts out the police officer and delves deeper into her work at St. Paul’s. Now it will take the persistence of a tenacious man, the questions from her curious young daughter, and the words from her dead husband’s journal to move Jamie beyond one Tuesday morning. “Jamie Bryan took her position at the far end of the Staten Island Ferry, pressed her body against the railing, eyes on the place where the Twin Towers once stood. She could face it now, every day if she had to. The terrorist attacks had happened, the World Trade Center had collapsed, and the only man she’d ever loved had gone down with them. Late fall was warmer than usual, and the breeze across the water washed over Jamie’s face. If she could do this, if she could make this journey three times a week while Sierra was in school, then she could convince herself to get through another long, dark night. She could face the empty place in the bed beside her, face the longing for the man who had been her best friend, the one she’d fallen for when she was only a girl.”",9/11 #2,,10/28/04,December 16th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Inspirational', 'Christian Romance', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']",,9780310257714,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440816802l/97863._SY475_.jpg,4.38,[],419.0,6.0,,97863.Beyond_Tuesday_Morning,,,,,97.0,9345.0,320,,Zondervan,"['5214', '2775', '1120', '193', '43']",,,[],,

The tiny village of Ulewic teeters between survival and destruction, faith and doubt, God and demons. For shadowing the villagers’ lives are men cloaked in masks and secrecy, ruling with violence, intimidation, and terrifying fiery rites: the Owl Masters. But another force is touching Ulewic—a newly formed community built and served only by women. Called a beguinage, it is a safe harbor of service and faith in defiance of the all-powerful Church. Behind the walls of this sanctuary, women have gathered from all walks of life: a skilled physician, a towering former prostitute, a cook, a local convert. But life in Ulewic is growing more dangerous with each passing day. The women are the subject of rumors, envy, scorn, and fury…until the daughter of Ulewic’s most powerful man is cast out of her home and accepted into the beguinage—and battle lines are drawn.Into this drama are swept innocents and conspirators: a parish priest trying to save himself from his own sins…a village teenager, pregnant and terrified…a woman once on the verge of sainthood, now cast out of the Church.…With Ulewic ravaged by flood and disease, and with villagers driven by fear, a secret inside the beguinage will draw the desperate and the depraved—until masks are dropped, faith is tested…and every lie is exposed.*New York Times Book Review**Marie Claire",,,03/26/09,June 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Medieval', 'Fantasy', 'British Literature', 'Historical Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']",,9780718153205,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327919010l/5263374.jpg,3.8,['Shirley Jackson Award Nominee for Novel (2009)'],247.0,3.0,,5263374-the-owl-killers,,,,,91.0,3759.0,640,,Michael Joseph,"['928', '1551', '950', '243', '87']",,,[],,

ILL WIND: Gabriella Berryngton is an unhappy and oppressed fourteen-year-old girl living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1683. She dreams of escaping her bitter, ambitious stepfather and sailing off into the unknown. Her dreams come true when her stepfather sells her into marriage. Aboard Freyja, she is hopeful that her new life in the Dutch West Indies will be an improvement – a hope that dies when she is given a slave, Klara, and a whip. She discovers that her soon-to-be father-in-law is a ruthless slave trader in league with pirates, and her fiancé is cold, unfriendly and disinterested in Gabriella. She is little more than a vessel to provide the next generation of van Eckens. Largely ignored and desperately unhappy, she and Klara develop a friendship which makes life bearable – at first. Once married, Gabriella’s life takes a turn for the worse and she descends into a world of horror and abuse until tensions finally explode. Life will never be the same and she has no choice but to take fate into her own hands. DEAD RECKONING: Leo is born in Spanish Panama in 1659. When he is twelve years old he witnesses the violent rape and murder of his mother by three of the Caribbean’s most feared pirates: Tarr, Blake and Hornigold, and swears revenge at all costs. Gabriella is trapped in an abusive marriage to a ruthless Dutch slave trader, who is in business with the same English cut-throats. She risks all to escape with her life. Leo and Gabriella meet aboard one of the most horrific ships in the Caribbean – a slaver – and join forces against their common enemy. They face a number of challenges as they battle not only the dangers of a life at sea, including storm, drowning, and being cast adrift in a crippled ship, but also repeated attacks by Blake and Hornigold.

Karen Robards (Goodreads Author),The Last Victim,,English,,"Dr. Charlotte Stone sees what others do not. A sought-after expert in criminal pathology, Charlie regularly sits face-to-face with madmen. Obsessed with learning what makes human monsters commit terrible crimes, Charlie desires little else from life—no doubt because when she was sixteen, she herself survived a serial killer’s bloodbath: A man butchered the family of Charlie’s best friend, Holly, then left the girl’s body on a seaside boardwalk one week later. Because of the information Charlie gave police, the Boardwalk Killer went underground. She kept to herself her eerie postmortem visions of Holly and her mother. And even years later, knowing her contact with ghosts might undermine her credibility as a psychological expert, Charlie tells no one about the visits she gets from the spirit world. Now all-too-handsome FBI agent Tony Bartoli is telling Charlie that a teenage girl is missing, her family slaughtered. Bartoli suspects that after fifteen years, the Boardwalk Killer—or a sick copycat with his M.O.—is back. Time is running short for an innocent, kidnapped girl, and Bartoli pleads for Charlie’s help. This is the one case Charlie shouldn’t go near. But she also knows that she may be the one person in the world who can stop this vicious killer. For Charlie—whose good looks disguise a world of hurt, vulnerability, and potent psychic gifts—a frantic hunt for a madman soon becomes a complex test of cunning, passions, and secrets. Aiding Dr. Stone on her quest to catch a madman is a ghostly presence with bad intentions: the fiery spirit of seductive bad boy Michael Garland who refuses to be ignored, though in his cat and mouse game they may both lose their hearts.

It’s a job she’s uniquely suited for, thanks to the secret talent that gives her an uncanny edge—Charlie can see dead people, whose tormented spirits cry out to her for the justice only she can provide.

Pawleys Island, South Carolina. Sunny, idyllic, and picture perfect, until a tabloid news program airs a splashy segment about the community's only unsolved murder-the grisly stabbing of teenager Tara Mitchell and the subsequent disappearance of her two best friends, both thought to be long dead. In the years since the murders, several families have moved into the mansion where the crime occurred, each claiming that the dead girls still haunt the house. Beautiful redheaded reporter Nicole Sullivan, sensing the story that could be her big break, arranges for her mother, a renowned psychic, to contact the three victims via a live sance on the show Twenty-four Hours Investigates.  But something goes terribly wrong during the segment, and a young woman is murdered in the exact same manner as Tara Mitchell was fifteen years earlier. Pressured by her producers to get the inside story, Nicole is ordered to continue to investigate. As an attraction grows between Nicole and police chief Joe Franconi, another identical murder occurs, along with a menacing note warning that the original killer is back to claim three more lives. The body count rises, and so does the danger to Nicole, who is attacked, barely escaping with her life.

Karen Tei Yamashita,Through the Arc of the Rain Forest,,English,,"Through the Arc of the Rain Forest is a burlesque of comic-strip adventures and apocalyptic portents that stretches familiar truths to their logical extreme in a future world that is just recognizable enough to be frightening. In the Author's Note,"" Karen Tei Yamashita writes that her book is like a Brazilian soap opera called a novela: ""the novela's story is completely changeable according to the whims of the public psyche and approval, although most likely, the unhappy find happiness; the bad are punished; true love reigns; a popular actor is saved from death ... an idyll striking innocence, boundless nostalgia and terrible ruthlessness."" The stage is a vast, mysterious field of impenetrable plastic in the Brazilian rain forest set against a backdrop of rampant environmental destruction, commercialization, poverty, and religious rapture. Through the Arc of the Rainforest is narrated by a small satellite hovering permanently around the head of an innocent character named Kazumasa. Through no fault of his own, Kazumasa seems to draw strange and significant people into his orbit and to find himself at the center of cataclysmic events that involve carrier pigeons, religious pilgrims, industrial espionage, magic feathers, big money, miracles, epidemics, true love, and the virtual end of the world. This book is simultaneously entertaining and depressing, with all the rollicking pessimism you'd expect of a good soap opera or a good political satire.""- Kirsten Backstrom, 500 Great Books by Women",,,11/06/90,July 1st 1990,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction']",,9780918273826,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388808029l/43706.jpg,3.92,"['American Book Award (1991)', 'Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize (1990)']",85.0,1.0,,43706.Through_the_Arc_of_the_Rain_Forest,,,,,92.0,864.0,212,,Coffee House Press,"['276', '326', '197', '50', '15']",,,[],,

On a mission to sabotage a chemical weapon research facility on a Separatist-held planet, four clone troopers operate under the very noses of their enemies.

Anakin Skywalker, believed by some to be the prophesied “Chosen One” destined to bring balance to the Force, is now a Jedi Knight under the tutelage of his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Death is a constant possibility–and his chances of survival aren’t improved by the unexpected arrival of an apprentice: Ahsoka, a brash, inexperienced fourteen-year-old Padawan apprenticed to Anakin.

When the Locust Horde burst from the ground fifteen years ago to slaughter the human population of Sera, mankind began a desperate war against extinction. Now after a decade and a half of bloody fighting, and with billions dead, the survivors—the Gears of the Coalition of Ordered Governments, along with a small band of civilians—have been forced to destroy their own cities and sacrifice their entire civilization to halt the Locust advance. The last-ditch measures have succeeded, but at an enormous cost: the survivors have been reduced to a handful of refugees. Escaping to a haven on the remote island of Vectes, they begin the heartbreaking task of rebuilding their devastated world. For a while, there’s hope . . . making peace with old enemies, and once again planning for the future. But the short respite is shattered when Vectes comes under siege from an even deadlier force than the Locust—the Lambent, a hideous and constantly mutating life-form that destroys everything in its path. As the Lambent’s relentless assault spreads from the mainland to the island, the refugees finally understand what drove the Locust from their underground warrens and sparked the global war. While Marcus Fenix and the Gears struggle to hold back the invasion, the Coalition faces a stark choice—fight this new enemy to the last human, or flee to the wastelands to take their chances and live like the human pariahs known as the Stranded . . . even as Coalition chairman Richard Prescott still guards one last, terrible secret about the Locust, the Lambent, and the future of mankind. . . .",Gears of War #4,,08/01/11,August 2nd 2011,"['Marcus Fenix', 'Dominic Santiago', 'Augustus Cole', 'Damon Baird', 'Anya Stroud', 'Victor Hoffmann', 'Bernadette ""Bernie"" Mataki', 'Adam Fenix', 'Padrick Salton', 'Queen Myrrah']",Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Video Games', 'Fiction', 'Games', 'Gaming', 'Aliens', 'Novels', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",,9781439183953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348081551l/8700172.jpg,4.27,[],96.0,1.0,,8700172-coalition-s-end,,,,,97.0,1444.0,443,,Gallery,"['703', '478', '222', '30', '11']",,,[],,

But Adam is buried in the rubble during a ferocious assault on the Fenix mansion, and Ephyra falls to the enemy. Marcus, grieving for a father everyone believes is dead, is court-martialed for dereliction of duty and sentenced to forty years in the Coalition of Ordered Government’s brutal maximum security prison, known simply as the Slab.But Adam is very much alive, snatched from the destruction by the elite Onyx Guard on Chairman Richard Prescott’s orders. He’s now a long way from home and in a prison of his own—a COG doomsday bunker on the tropical island of Azura, a place hidden from the rest of Sera since the Pendulum Wars. His own guilty secret has been exposed: Adam knew the Locust existed deep below the surface of Sera long before Emergence Day, and were being driven from their tunnels by a lethal parasite known as the Lambent. Now he has to find a way to destroy the Lambent while the dwindling COG forces fight to hold back a growing Locust army that’s threatening to overrun the city.As Adam struggles to find redemption in his comfortable island jail, Marcus seeks his own atonement in the squalid, closed world within the Slab’s granite walls.

The Locust Queen would never release him, even if he developed a countermeasure. But he didn’t deserve any better. “I also have my service pistol.” “And I can take your son at any time.” He had the measure of her, then, and she had his. “You leave Marcus out of this. It’s a condition.” He opened the desk drawer and took out the handgun, a 9mm officer’s weapon.

  Husbands and wives. Mothers and daughters. The past and the future. 

  Secrets bind them. And secrets can destroy them. 
The author of Pretty Girls returns with an electrifying, emotionally complex thriller that plunges its fascinating protagonist into the darkest depths of a mystery that just might destroy him. With the discovery of a murder at an abandoned construction site, Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is brought in on a case that becomes much more dangerous when the dead man is identified as an ex-cop.Studying the body, Sara Linton—the GBI’s newest medical examiner and Will’s lover—realizes that the extensive blood loss didn't belong to the corpse. Sure enough, bloody footprints leading away from the scene indicate there is another victim—a woman—who has vanished . . . and who will die soon if she isn’t found.Will is already compromised, because the site belongs to the city’s most popular citizen: a wealthy, powerful, and politically connected athlete protected by the world’s most expensive lawyers—a man who’s already gotten away with rape, despite Will’s exhaustive efforts to put him away.But the worst is yet to come. Evidence soon links Will’s troubled past to the case . . . and the consequences will tear through his life with the force of a tornado, wreaking havoc for Will and everyone around him, including his colleagues, family, friends—and even the suspects he pursues.Relentlessly suspenseful and furiously paced, peopled with conflicted, fallible characters who leap from the page, The Kept Woman is a seamless blend of twisty police procedural and ingenious psychological thriller -- a searing, unforgettable novel of love, loss, and redemption.  ",Will Trent #8,,06/14/16,September 20th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Detective', 'Contemporary']",,9780062430212,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462032117l/28374062.jpg,4.1,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2016)'],191.0,2.0,,28374062-the-kept-woman,,,,,96.0,42940.0,461,,William Morrow,"['15842', '17730', '7530', '1389', '449']",,,['Georgia (United States)'],,

Yet, as the weeks go on, the two grow increasingly close and their relationship changes from purely platonic to something…more.Something that makes Vera feel alive for the first time.Something that can never, ever be.Or so she thinks.","Love, in English #1",,,April 20th 2014,"['Mateo Casalles', 'Vera Miles']",Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Sports', 'Erotica', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Drama']",,B00JMO9W4K,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397332210l/21899546.jpg,4.07,[],386.0,4.0,,21899546-love-in-english,,,,,92.0,15176.0,439,,Metal Blonde Books,"['6460', '5008', '2466', '769', '473']",,,[],,
Karina Halle (Goodreads Author),Dirty Angels,,English,,"**warning: this book contains situations which might be triggers for some people. Please see the bottom of this description to see if this is the kind of book that you'll love or piss you off**For Luisa Chavez, a twenty-three year old former beauty queen, a better life has always been just out of her reach. Sure, she’s had men at her feet since she was a young teenager but she’s never had the one thing she’s craved – security. Having grown up in near poverty, her waitressing job in Cabo San Lucas can barely let her take care of herself, let alone her ailing parents. Every day is another unwanted advance, every day is a struggle to survive.When Salvador Reyes, the depraved leader of a major Mexican cartel, takes an interest in her, Luisa is presented with an opportunity she can’t afford to pass up. She’ll become Salvador’s wife and exchange her freedom and body for a life of riches – riches she can bestow upon her deserving parents. But Luisa quickly finds out that even the finest wines and jewels can’t undo the ugliness in her marriage, nor the never-ending violence that threatens her every move.Soon, Luisa is looking for an escape, a way out of the carefully controlled life she’s leading. She finally gets her wish in the worst way possible.As it is, being the wife of Salvador makes her an ideal target for rival cartels and there’s one particular man who needs Luisa as part of his cartel’s expansion. One particular man whose quest for power has destroyed lives, slit throats and gotten him out of an American prison. One particular man who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.That man is Javier Bernal. And he wants Luisa. He wants to take her, keep her, ruin her.Unless she ruins him first.***WARNING*** This book deals with drug cartels and as such it contains a lot of sex and violence and some violent sex. It can get pretty ugly, pretty dark and pretty crazy. There is drug use, abuse, a bit of torture and dubious consent. The hero is not a hero and the villains...well, they're even worse.

If you are even a bit squeamish about violence, brutality and rape, this is your warning to stay away from a book that you certainly will not like (and why read books that you know you won't like?)******While this is a spin-off of The Artists Trilogy, prior knowledge of the books is not needed.

In preparing these lectures Jaspers, whom the Nazis had already dismissed from his professorship at Heidelberg, knew that he was speaking in Germany for the last time. Jaspers used the occasion to offer an account of the cultural and intellectual situation from which existentialism emerged as well as a summary of his own philosophy.The book serves three purposes today: it brings the many strands of the existential movement into focus; it provides an overview of Jaspers's own philosophical position; and it demonstrates by example that philosophy need not be irrational, antiscientific, journalistic, or homiletic in order to be existential and engage. In this short book Jaspers provides a corrective for the popular view of existentialism as a pessimistic, irrationalist philosophy.

In a compelling narrative, Marlantes weaves riveting accounts of his combat experiences with thoughtful analysis, self-examination and his readings -- from Homer to the Mahabharata to Jung. He talks frankly about how he is haunted by the face of the young North Vietnamese soldier he killed at close quarters and how he finally finds a way to make peace with his past. Marlantes discusses the daily contradictions that warriors face in the grind of war, where each battle requires them to take life or spare life, and where they enter a state he likens to the fervor of religious ecstasy.Just as Matterhorn is already being acclaimed as a classic of war literature, What It Is Like To Go To War is set to become required reading for anyone -- soldier or civilian -- interested in this visceral and all too essential part of the human experience.",,,,August 30th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Military History']",,9780802119926,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438699073l/11290708._SX318_.jpg,3.87,['Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)'],190.0,3.0,,11290708-what-it-is-like-to-go-to-war,,,,,88.0,8047.0,257,,Atlantic Monthly Press,"['2699', '2930', '1466', '591', '361']",,,[],,
Karl Marlantes,Matterhorn,,English,,"A big, powerful saga of men in combat, written over the course of thirty-five years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran.Intense, powerful, and compelling, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead and James Jones's The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.Written over the course of thirty years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.A graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Karl Marlantes served as a Marine in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals.

From Kapital sprung the economic and political systems that at one time dominated half the earth and for nearly a century kept the world on the brink of war. Even today, more than one billion Chinese citizens live under a regime that proclaims fealty to Marxist ideology. Yet this important tome has been passed over by many readers frustrated by Marx’s difficult style and his preoccupation with nineteenth-century events of little relevance to today's reader.Here Serge Levitsky presents a revised version of Kapital, abridged to emphasize the political and philosophical core of Marx’s work while trimming away much that is now unimportant. Pointing out Marx’s many erroneous predictions about the development of capitalism, Levitsky's introduction nevertheless argues for Kapital's relevance as a prime example of a philosophy of economic determinism that ""subordinates the problems of human freedom and human dignity to the issues of who should own the means of production and how wealth should be distributed.""Here then is a fresh and highly readable version of a work whose ideas provided inspiration for communist regimes' ideological war against capitalism, a struggle that helped to shape the world today.",Capital #1-3,Abridged,10/28/67,July 1st 1996,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Theory', 'German Literature', 'Business']",,9780895267115,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388289025l/238953.jpg,3.86,[],363.0,4.0,,238953.Das_Kapital,,,,,88.0,8160.0,356,,Gateway Editions,"['3026', '2419', '1710', '570', '435']",,,[],,

Karl May,Winnetou I - IV,,German,,"Karl May's most popular work originally published in 1892 and influenced by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Winnetou is the story of a young Apache chief told by his white friend and blood-brother Old Shatterhand. The action takes place in the U.S. Southwest, in the latter half of the 1800s, where the Indian way of life is threatened by the first transcontinental railroad. Winnetou, the only Native Indian chief who could have united the various rival tribes to reach a settlement with the whites, is murdered. His tragic death foreshadows the death of his people.

Karl May,Pengembaraan Dr. Karl May: Llano Estacado,,,,"The Spanish name Llano Estacado, meaning Staked Plain, is part of the high plains of the United States, located west of today’s Lubbock, Texas. It covers an area of about 30,000 square miles, extending to the state of New Mexico. It is a strikingly flat and monotonous area at an elevation of between 3,000-4,000 feet. Local water-retaining depressions and washes that, due to the meager rainfall, rarely hold water occasionally break this semiarid plain. Sandstorms can cut down vision in the midst of day and scour the unwary with tiny bullets of sand. It is said that even Indians hesitated to cross this wasteland. Myth holds that the Coronado expedition planted stakes as guideposts for the return trip when it first crossed the plain westward, giving the area its name. Karl May has used the myth of the stakes as a backdrop for his story of ‘The Ghost of Llano Estacado’. Again, he assembles many of his Western heroes for new adventures and the performance of good deeds, in the process adding a few new characters. One of his recurring characters, Hobble-Frank, owner of the Villa “Bear Fat” in Saxony, know-it-all, mangler of half-knowledge, with his persistent and extensive elaboration’s, may have been funny a hundred years ago when read in German. However, his argumentative discourses, when translated into English, become rather tedious. They often have no meaning for the English-only reader, since they deal with local events and characters of his (and Karl May’s) home state, and mangle geography and ancient history in an attempt to be funny. At worst, they make no sense when translated. Hence, I have taken the liberty to severely edit his profuseness to make the story line flow more smoothly.

He strikes up a deep friendship with another exiled Norwegian, a Nietzschean intellectual and boxing fanatic named Geir. He also tracks down Linda, whom he met at a writers' workshop a few years earlier and who fascinated him deeply.Book Two is at heart a love story—the story of Karl Ove falling in love with his wife. But the novel also tells other stories: of becoming a father, of the turbulence of family life, of outrageously unsuccessful attempts at a family vacation, of the emotional strain of birthday parties for children, and of the daily frustrations, rhythms, and distractions of Stockholm keeping him from (and filling) his novel.""Intense and vital. . . . Where many contemporary writers would reflexively turn to irony, Knausgaard is intense and utterly honest, unafraid to voice universal anxieties. . . . The need for totality . . . brings superb, lingering, celestial passages. . . . He wants us to inhabit he ordinariness of life, which is sometimes vivid, sometimes banal, and sometimes momentous, but all of it perforce ordinary because it happens in the course of a life, and happens, in different forms, to everyone. . . .

Karl Popper,The Open Society and Its Enemies - Volume One: The Spell of Plato,,English,,"Popper was born in 1902 to a Viennese family of Jewish origin. He taught in Austria until 1937, when he emigrated to New Zealand in anticipation of the Nazi annexation of Austria the following year, and he settled in England in 1949. Before the annexation, Popper had written mainly about the philosophy of science, but from 1938 until the end of the Second World War he focused his energies on political philosophy, seeking to diagnose the intellectual origins of German and Soviet totalitarianism. The Open Society and Its Enemies was the result. In the book, Popper condemned Plato, Marx, and Hegel as ""holists"" and ""historicists""--a holist, according to Popper, believes that individuals are formed entirely by their social groups; historicists believe that social groups evolve according to internal principles that it is the intellectual's task to uncover. Popper, by contrast, held that social affairs are unpredictable, and argued vehemently against social engineering. He also sought to shift the focus of political philosophy away from questions about who ought to rule toward questions about how to minimize the damage done by the powerful. The book was an immediate sensation, and--though it has long been criticized for its portrayals of Plato, Marx, and Hegel--it has remained a landmark on the left and right alike for its defense of freedom and the spirit of critical inquiry.",The Open Society and its Enemies #1,,11/06/45,February 21st 1971,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Political Science', 'Theory', 'Economics']",,9780691019680,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388463471l/1129911.jpg,4.13,[],55.0,1.0,,1129911.The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies_Volume_One,,,,,93.0,2331.0,376,,Princeton University Press,"['1029', '816', '313', '104', '69']",,,[],,

Karl Rove (Goodreads Author),Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight,,English,,"From the moment he set foot on it, Karl Rove has rocked America’s political stage. He ran the national College Republicans at twenty-two, and turned a Texas dominated by Democrats into a bastion for Republicans. He launched George W. Bush to national renown by unseating a popular Democratic governor, and then orchestrated a GOP White House win. For engineering victory after unlikely victory, Rove became known as “the Architect.”   Because of his success, Rove has been attacked his entire career, accused of everything from campaign chicanery to ideological divisiveness. In this frank memoir, Rove responds to critics, passionately articulates his political philosophy, and defends the choices he made on the campaign trail and in the White House. In the course of putting the record straight, Rove takes on Democratic leaders like Harry Reid and Tom Daschle who acted cynically or deviously behind closed doors, and even Republicans who lacked backbone at crucial moments.    Among other controversial topics Rove addresses, he sets the record straight on:    The facts of his mother’s suicide and reports of his father’s alleged homosexuality   The accusation that he bugged his own office in Texas   The real story of how George W. Bush defeated governor Ann Richards   The details of Bush’s stealth campaign to win the White House in 2000   Why Bush cratered in New Hampshire but prevailed in South Carolina in 2000    How Bush chose Dick Cheney as his presidential running mate   How the Bush campaign managed Bush’s DUI   The defection of Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords    The frustrating challenges of Hurricane Katrina   The facts behind Rove’s painful three years fending off a federal indictment, and   Why Obama is wrong on healthcare.   
   
 Courage and Consequence is also the first intimate account from the highest level at the White House of one of the most headline-making presidencies of the modern age. Rove takes readers behind the scenes of:    The bitterly contested 2000 presidential contest   Every tense minute aboard Air Force One on 9/11   The decision to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, and   The hard-won 2004 reelection fight.     Rove is candid about his mistakes in the West Wing and in his campaigns, and talks frankly about the heartbreak of his early family years. He spells out what it takes to win elections and how to govern successfully once a candidate has won. But Courage and Consequence is ultimately about the joy of a life committed to the conservative cause, a life spent in political combat and service to country, no matter the costs.",,,,March 9th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Presidents', 'American']",,9781439191057,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347467874l/7170336.jpg,3.75,[],76.0,1.0,,7170336-courage-and-consequence,,,,,90.0,1555.0,567,,Threshold Editions,"['424', '542', '426', '107', '56']",,,[],,

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),"You Really Are Full of Shit, Aren't You?",,English,,"Rascal-Sage Karl Wiggins has done it again, only this time even better.In America they’re called Advice Columnists, in England Agony Aunts. Well Karl Wiggins is an Agony Uncle who takes no crapEveryone has read these columns in the dentist waiting room, and I have to agree with Karl in that the majority of Agony Aunts or Advice Columnists are without exception patronising, condescending and pretentious, providing the same type of namby-pamby, wishy-washy band-aid solution for just about every dilemma; “I’m sorry to hear what you’re going through, but you know life is full of ups and downs, I’m sure if you give it time …….” In short, they are no help whatsoever. Not so Wiggins, for he has the Heaven-sent ability of being able to get right to the nitty-gritty in just a few sentences. His answers, however, are more often than not roll-on-the-floor hilarious. Karl makes it absolutely clear that he’s no marriage guidance counsellor, psychotherapist, priest or vegetarian, but his adequacy to hand out solid advice is confirmed as soon as you start reading this book. His advice is delivered in a humorous, occasionally impassioned and exasperated, yet always intuitive manner. Karl speaks from the heart and never, ever evades the issue. If you’re looking to read one of those family therapy books where the advisor hems and haws, and sits on the fence and tap-dances around the issue then stop right now. This is not the book for you. But if you’re searching for straight-talking guidance on dating, marriage, cohabitation, divorce, sensuality, lust, and sexual urges then look no further. This is the book you’re afterKarl Wiggins does not tread warily around any issue whatsoever – racism, under-age sex, religious extremism, sexual violence. And he does not mince his words; Just the opposite in fact. I’ve known Karl for several years and I’ll tell you he dances towards trouble with a huge grin on his face, which is why I call him the Rascal-Sage. He is in truth a laughing, joking Shaman. The court jester but with all the respect of a sorcerer, for there’s always an element of danger lurking about beneath the surface of his smile, and when he’s angry he is truly a site to behold (Maybe that’s what attracts the reader). Karl, thank you for being you, for not judging me, for seeing me as I truly am and for allowing me the honour of writing the forward to this book for you.

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),Calico Jack in your Garden,,English,,"Embarrassingly, a number of the reviews for this book seem to involve people losing control of their bladder; “Anyone who is a bit saucy, very fond of boobies and doesn't mind peeing slightly when they laugh too hard, this is the book for you!” “I have to admit that I wet myself twice while reading it but this may in part have been due to my age and a couple of bottles of a fine St. Emilion,” “Due to the laughter you owe my secretary one clean pair of knickers.”Two reviewers have even suggested I should tour as a stand-up comedian; “I found myself laughing out-loud and even sharing segments with my spouse ….. I think Karl could tour as a stand-up comedian,” “Mr Wiggins has views on life that are expressed in a manner worthy of any stand-up comedian.” So my scribblings do seem to raise a smile and a chuckle, and either way you look at it, that has to be a good thing. “I got kicked out of bed TWICE for laughing so hard. This is, by far, one of the funniest books I've yet read” “JFC!!!! This is soooo hilarious”“I have never, ever read a book that caught me so unawares and made me laugh so much as Calico Jack. I laughed and laughed so much on the train home that I had to stop reading it. He is capable of making the reader cry with laughter” “There were times when I had to set the Kindle down and just laugh out loud. Some of Mr Wiggins' thoughts are just hilarious” Whilst it’s evident that a number of people love my writing - I've even been told by some that they settle themselves with a cup of coffee before reading my blogs, Newspaper columns or Facebook posts - I'm very much aware that I have an inappropriate sense of humour that isn’t to everyone’s taste. In short, not everyone ‘gets’ me. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing, and this often seems insensitive to other cultures, but the bedrock of the British sense of humour is a strong sense of sarcasm and self-deprecation. The British can be very passionate – and if you doubt that try going to a football match - but that passion is often hidden deep in our humour so that other nationals fail to not only recognise the deadpan delivery but are never too sure if they’ve been involved in a serious conversation or just a little bit of friendly banter. Having said that my style of writing is now appealing more and more to the American market.No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough. If you’re looking for Humorous books about Life, Comedy Writing or even Humorous Books for Adults then take a chance on this book; I’ve been told I write with an “easy-going style and a zest for living that is infectious.” I’m not so sure about that, but I have an opinion on a range of hot issues, although you don’t have to agree with all my views to enjoy the ride. Other comments on my writing style warn that I ""talk to the reader with all the confidence of a man in touch with his own reality, in a voice which is seasoned with a hint of world weariness that is so telling of a writer who has written what he knows and written it with disarming fearlessness."" And that I guess is true. I can be a handful at times and I know it. I’m strong-willed, a bit outspoken and I write exactly what I’m thinking.

We read about them in the papers, we listen to radio hosts discuss them on phone-in programmes and we talk about them to our mates at work and in the pub.

And isn’t this what we all want? A safer place for our children and our grandchildren?From time to time I tend to get a little frustrated in the book, and if my language upsets you then I apologise, but far better you read it with full emotion than a half-hearted attempt to hold myself in check.

You climb in and then before you know it you are coasting in fifth, Ray-Bans on, wind in your hair, lovely! Suddenly you grind to a disturbing, hissing halt. Karl drops a spanner in the works, a bag of sugar into his cavernous tank of diesel fuelled wisdom and you stall in awestruck wonder at his incredible insight. So there you are, stranded in Watts with a dozen members of the Bounty Hunters or the Mad Swan Bloods trying to rock your car over, with no option but to stop, gather your thoughts, catch your breath and carry on reading, because by this time you’re unstoppable.”“Karl Wiggins is a natural storyteller, and ‘White Boy in Watts’ is a compulsive read, bringing to life all the not-so-ordinary people and places that are generally under-represented in literature.

You’ll almost smell the omnipresent whiff of cheap wine, and feel the dirty lino under your feet.Read the true life adventures of an English lad as he struggles to make a living amongst ‘gangstas’ who are arguably the most violent in the United States.For anyone who has puked in the back of a cab, then argued over the fare at 3am, this book is your driver’s revenge. I’ve done my best to create a ‘living poem’ that is by turns thoughtful and brutal, but very funny.People have always told me I’m a natural storyteller, but like every good cab driver I have an opinion on a range of hot issues, from the congestion charge to Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam. You’ll be able to hear my characters, see them and, in some instances, actually smell them. They’ll leave their stain on you. You may well be able to relate to guys who used their fists and their wits, you may laugh at their humour and get their jokes, but it’ll be the thugs with guns and no soul who will unsettle you.

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),Shit my History Teacher DID NOT tell me!,,English,,"If you’re a history or philosophy buff this book should be as irresistible as a kebab to a pisshead So what’s it all about then? History, that’s what. “Errgghhh boring boring bollocks boring, I had enough of that crap when I was at school. History just went on and on and on and on and on ….. and on and on. Nothing different ever happened.”Well that’s where you’re wrong, because I’m going to bring it alive. Not all history books, or even books about teaching history, have to be tedious. I’ve looked under every rock, in every nook and cranny. I’ve searched all over the place and dug up some really interesting little titbits. Stuff not a lot of people know. So stay with me on this one. I’ve chosen to look at past events from the birth of the planet to the birth of Christ. That’s enough for one book, isn’t it? Well, not really, because I’ve gone off track a little bit from time to time, but I do tend to do that so don’t worry about it.If you’ve got a teenager who’s studying the history of this period, download a copy for them now because it’s all laid out nice and clear. But let me warn you, I have in the past been accused of having an inappropriate sense of humour, so if you want a little bit of a chuckle watching me make fun out of everyone I meet down the years, then this is the book for you - and if your offspring is in their early teens then it probably isn’t the book for them.As I say, I do tend to stray into the modern day from time to time to bring things into focus, but I promise you this book will surprise you, inform you, keep you interested and put a smile on your face from time to time. I discuss philosophers and philosophy a lot, including ancient Greek philosophers, Chinese beliefs and philosophy from around the world, but if you think it’s all Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, there’s a lot more here to be discovered. You’ll be surprised, for instance, at the similarities between the Celts and the Native Americans. The Rosicrucians will fascinate you, as will some of the secrets held by Alexander the Great!

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),Words are our Sorcery,,English,,"Trance Poetry. You know those ….. drifting kinds of thoughts? When it’s easy to believe that someone else is dreaming you? Well that’s Trance Poetry. The purpose of the poems in this book are to try and show how words alone can lift you up and take you places, how they can enchant and bewitch, creating the illusion that just for a few minutes everything’s alright with the world. When I started to write poetry I searched around for subject matter, and chose colour. Not yellow, red and blue, but Paprika, Jet, Ochre, Huckleberry Blue, Fiesta etc. and went inside trying to see where that ‘colour’ would take me. From this I created a series of poems which I entitled Colour-oetry, and I’ve included these here as well. Only half of this book is poetry, well 56% to be precise. A while ago I took an interest in the parallel lives of the chef and the writer. How the chef creates his magic in the chaotic environment of the kitchen compares well with how the writer creates his hocus-pocus in the peace and quiet of his study. A chef’s wizardry is in his ingredients, whilst a writer’s sorcery is in his words. So I wrote a few chapters on food, following it all over the world at one stage, attempting to paint pictures with my words. But I also focused on the 'writer,' comparing him or her not only to the chef but also to other master tradesmen, even a bricklayer at one stage. Deep down this is the purpose of this book, to discuss the art of the writer and the sorcery in his words. Whether I’ve succeeded or not, only the reader can tell. I’ve finished the book with three chapters on parenting experiences. True stories actually. My goal here is to use the writer’s sorcery to establish emotion and hopefully leave you with a lump in your throat.

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),Dogshit Saved My Life,,English,,"My goal, my life’s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire. And this is probably why I write the way I do, in order to use self-deprecating, piss-taking humour to bring to the fore situations that just don’t stack up. To demonstrate that serious issues can be approached with humour.  Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing, and this often seems insensitive to other cultures, but the bedrock of the British sense of humour is a strong sense of sarcasm and self-deprecation. The British can be very passionate – and if you doubt that try going to a football match - but that passion is often hidden deep in our humour so that other nationals fail to not only recognise the deadpan delivery and are never too sure if they’ve been involved in a serious conversation or just a little bit of friendly banter. Having said that my style of writing is now appealing more and more to the American market.  This book is not a novel, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough.

Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author),"Nobody Asked Me, But ....",,English,,"Apart from breaking two of my mates' noses (one in the ring and one chasing a 'runner') I used to be known for my stories. And they were all true. I'd come back from distant shores and speak of my adventures.  So much so in fact that people used to say, ""You should write a book.""  My diatribes in my blogs and newspaper columns are simply my way of spinning the balls, because sometimes I like to see what number they land on. That’s all.  But although I’m known mostly as a raconteur - and most of my books can be described as coming from the humourist vein – in ‘Nobody Asked Me’ I touch on some subjects that are surely going to upset a few people.  I’ve never quite understood the politically correct brigade. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he’s laughing. No longer simply a fad, blogging is now an important new literary innovation. This book is not a story, and if you’re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It’s not for you. I won’t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I’m not being controversial enough – and trust me when I say that in this book I get controversial.  Oh, don’t worry; the humour that my fans seem to enjoy so much is still there, but right now the planet’s spinning in new and scary directions, and this needs to be addressed. So inside the covers of this book I take a look at some of the challenges we’re currently facing. And some of my opinions are going to rattle a few people.  So is a comedy writer honestly the best one to challenge some of the perceptions we’re facing nowadays? Well, I’ve always believed that if you can make people laugh then they tend to listen to what you say when you’re serious. And my goal, my life’s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire.  So why the rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. Well ‘Rabbit & Pork’ is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I’ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively – mostly at parties, and generally by my wife.  But why a tin of soup? Well I tend to believe that everyone is born perfect. Nobody is born with an inherent capacity to hate. It has to be taught. All of our experiences – family, school, work, the books we read, the newspapers we peruse, the music we listen to, our friends, our social life, the opinions of those around us, religion, sports we play or watch, those we love and those who love us, those we desire and those who desire us, those we travel with, our hopes and dreams and ambitions and achievements, our triumphs and disasters - go into a metaphorical cooking pot that we carry with us throughout our lives.  All these ‘ingredients’ make up our Soup of Life.  Now, when making a soup, once you’ve added an ingredient, it’s forever blended in and you can’t take it out again. You add a sprinkling of finely chopped garnish; cumin or oregano, and you can never take that ingredient out again. Never, ever, ever. So say at the age of six you add black pepper or rosemary or hatred or love or comedy, from then onwards it’ll always be part and parcel of your ‘soup.’ And as you add more ingredients the ‘recipe’ of your life evolves, and before you know it you can’t taste the coriander or the love any more, but it’s still there at a deep subliminal level.

Well, although my last book was entitled ‘100 Common Sense Policies to make BRITAIN GREAT again’ the book before that, ‘Nobody Asked Me, But …’, showed a rabbit popping out of a tin of soup on the cover. ‘Rabbit & Pork,’ of course, is Cockney rhyming slang for Talk, and on more than one occasion I’ve been accused of rabbiting away excessively – mostly at parties, and generally by my wife.

A cry for those who want to change the world!Karl Wiggins has a powerful and potent knack for expression which has completely escaped restraint and self-control. Too much writing nowadays is watered-down garbage. The world is looking for something new, and in this book, Wiggins has created many ‘worth-pondering-over’ ideas!We are experiencing the same intensity of energy in diminished and more concise time periods, which is why more and more Wrong Planet tribes are gatheringKarl Wiggins informed me, when I agreed to write the forward for this book, that his goal was for those he calls Carefree Scamps to finish the book slightly punch-drunk. And I admit that with me he’s managed it remarkably. If you don’t believe that a limited number of astute, dedicated human beings can change the world, or simply just call attention to its imperfections and vulnerabilities, this book is going to change your mind. But before you get there, in the first third of the book Karl introduces us to a number of famous eccentrics who just didn’t (or don’t) ‘fit in’ He discusses the erratic, the bizarre and the downright kooky. People such as David Bowie, Marilyn Monroe, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Arthur Rimbaud, François Villon (the Medieval Beatnik), Bessie Stringfield, Sixteen-String Jack Rann, Anne Bonny & Mary Read (the Lesbian Pirates), Frida Kahlo, the Beat Generation poets and a whole host of dropouts, misfits, pranksters, bohemians, court jesters, comedians, crackpots and Gypsies.The reader will love reading about these swashbuckling daredevils, headcases and artists who changed their world, and even more so when Wiggins goes on to blend some of them with those from his own tribe.

He realises he’s possibly a psychotic depressive or even a schizophrenic, and yet he has no one to turn to.His one love is Jelly, a drug addict, although neither of them realise how much they’ve come to rely on each other.Billy’s life is unravelling fast. He’s prone to violent rages, and his distortion can change whilst driving as time slows down and speeds up again and buildings starts to move. Billy writes with intelligence about his life, and the advice that you really shouldn’t be getting in his cab is sound. Billy has suicidal thoughts whilst driving.

Karleen Koen (Goodreads Author),Dark Angels,,English,,"Alice Verney is a young woman intent on achieving her dreams. Having left Restoration England in the midst of a messy scandal, she has been living in Louis XIV’s Baroque, mannered France for two years. Now she is returning home to England and anxious to re-establish herself quickly. First, she will regain her former position as a maid of honor to Charles II’s queen. Then she will marry the most celebrated duke of the Restoration, putting herself in a position to attain power she’s only dreamed of. As a duchess, Alice will be able to make or break her friends and enemies at will. But all is not as it seems in the rowdy, merry court of Charles II. Since the Restoration, old political alliances have frayed, and there are whispers that the king is moving to divorce his barren queen, who some wouldn’t mind seeing dead. But Alice, loyal only to a select few, is devoted to the queen, and so sets out to discover who might be making sinister plans, and if her own father is one of them. When a member of the royal family dies unexpectedly, and poison is suspected, the stakes are raised. Alice steps up her efforts to find out who is and isn’t true to the queen, learns of shocking betrayals throughout court, and meets a man that she may be falling in love with—and who will spoil all of her plans. With the suspected arrival of a known poison-maker, the atmosphere in the court electrifies, and suddenly the safety of the king himself seems uncertain. Secret plots are at play, and war is on the horizon—but will it be with the Dutch or the French? And has King Charles himself betrayed his country for greed?

Karsonya Wise Whitehead (Goodreads Author),Notes from a Colored Girl: The Civil War Pocket Diaries of Emilie Frances Davis,,,,"In Notes from a Colored Girl, Karsonya Wise Whitehead examines the life and experiences of Emilie Frances Davis, a freeborn twenty-one-year-old mulatto woman, through a close reading of three pocket diaries she kept from 1863 to 1865. Whitehead explores Davis's worldviews and politics, her perceptions of both public and private events, her personal relationships, and her place in Philadelphia's free black community in the nineteenth century. Although Davis's daily entries are sparse, brief snapshots of her life, Whitehead interprets them in ways that situate Davis in historical and literary contexts that illuminate nineteenth-century black American women's experiences. Whitehead's contribution of edited text and original narrative fills a void in scholarly documentation of women who dwelled in spaces between white elites, black entrepreneurs, and urban dwellers of every race and class.Notes from a Colored Girl is a unique offering to the fields of history and documentary editing as the book includes both a six-chapter historical reconstruction of Davis's life and a full, heavily annotated edition of her Civil War-era pocket diaries. Drawing on scholarly traditions from history, literature, feminist studies, and sociolinguistics, Whitehead investigates Davis's diary both as a complete literary artifact and in terms of her specific daily entries.From a historical perspective, Whitehead re-creates the narrative of Davis's life for those three years and analyzes the black community where she lived and worked. From a literary perspective, Whitehead examines Davis's diary as a socially, racially, and gendered nonfiction text. From a feminist studies perspective, she examines Davis's agency and identity, grounded in theories elaborated by black feminist scholars. And, from linguistic and rhetorical perspectives, she studies Davis's discourse about her interpersonal relationships, her work, and external events in her life in an effort to understand how she used language to construct her social, racial, and gendered identities.Since there are few primary sources written by black women during this time in history, Davis's diary--though ordinary in its content--is rendered extraordinary simply because it has survived to be included in this very small class of resources. Whitehead's extensive analysis illuminates the lives of many through the simple words of one.

Starting with the Birmingham Campaign (Project C), Whitehead outlines, defines, and deconstructs five Critical Moments including the release of Dr. King's ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" the assassination of Medgar Evers, the March on Washington, and the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. With an introduction from Dr. Alicia Moore and Dr. La Vonne Neal, the book also includes an article on critical pedagogy by Dr. Conra Gist and a lesson plan for teaching the Woodson Lecture to K-16 students.

The Railways is the lifeline of the nation and, in many ways, its development has been deeply intertwined with the destiny of India. India Junction, featuring in-depth, analytical essays that are rich in history, delectable travel pieces and some truly amazing and rare photo features, celebrates the changes the Railways has brought about in our lives and examines how the Railways itself has transformed over time. 'The Great Indian Railways' takes us to 1853, the year train travel began in India and analyses how it strengthened British rule. 'Railway Filmy Chakkar' recounts how Mahatma Gandhi, who was first opposed to the Railways, went on to effectively use it in the freedom struggle. The travelogues, too, are delightfully evocative and bring to vivid life the sights and sounds of train travel in India, some contemporary, others long consigned to memory. 'When the Train Came to Deyra Dhoon' remembers the furore caused by an engine chugging into a sleepy little town for the first time. 'On Board the Bombay Express' recreates the tangy, savoury smells that are released into the carriage and the keen appetites that they awaken when women crack open the tiffin boxes which they have brought from home. Featuring award-winning and renowned authors, including Sir Mark Tully, Ruskin Bond, Gillian Wright, Ian J.

A Vagrant is an uproarious romp through history and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of New Yorker cartoonist and comics-sensation Kate Beaton.

She deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is, of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture never gets old. Hark!

Kate Bolick,Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own,,English,,"A bold, original, moving book that will inspire fanatical devotion and ignite debate.Whom to marry, and when will it happen - these two questions define every woman's existence. So begins Spinster, a revelatory and slyly erudite look at the pleasures and possibilities of remaining single. Using her own experiences as a starting point, journalist and cultural critic Kate Bolick invites us into her carefully considered, passionately lived life, weaving together the past and present to examine why­ she - along with over 100 million American women, whose ranks keep growing - remains unmarried. This unprecedented demographic shift, Bolick explains, is the logical outcome of hundreds of years of change that has neither been fully understood, nor appreciated. Spinster introduces a cast of pioneering women from the last century whose genius, tenacity, and flair for drama have emboldened Bolick to fashion her life on her own terms: columnist Neith Boyce, essayist Maeve Brennan, social visionary Charlotte Perkins Gilman, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, and novelist Edith Wharton. By animating their unconventional ideas and choices, Bolick shows us that contemporary debates about settling down, and having it all, are timeless - the crucible upon which all thoughtful women have tried for centuries to forge a good life. Intellectually substantial and deeply personal, Spinster is both an unreservedly inquisitive memoir and a broader cultural exploration that asks us to acknowledge the opportunities within ourselves to live authentically. Bolick offers us a way back into our own lives - a chance to see those splendid years when we were young and unencumbered, or middle-aged and finally left to our own devices, for what they really are: unbounded and our own to savor.",,,,April 21st 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Biography', 'Womens', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Essays']",,9780385347136,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438054638l/22889766.jpg,3.45,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2015)'],99.0,1.0,,22889766-spinster,,,,,81.0,8355.0,308,,Crown,"['1648', '2520', '2579', '1177', '431']",,,[],,

Kate Brown,"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters",,English,,"While many transnational histories of the nuclear arms race have been written, Kate Brown provides the first definitive account of the great plutonium disasters of the United States and the Soviet Union.In Plutopia,  Brown draws on official records and dozens of interviews to tell the extraordinary stories of Richland, Washington and Ozersk, Russia-the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium. To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Fully employed and medically monitored, the residents of Richland and Ozersk enjoyed all the pleasures of consumer society, while nearby, migrants, prisoners, and soldiers were banned from plutopia--they lived in temporary ""staging grounds"" and often performed the most dangerous work at the plant. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. Because of the decades of secrecy, downwind and downriver neighbors of the plutonium plants had difficulty proving what they suspected, that the rash of illnesses, cancers, and birth defects in their communities were caused by the plants' radioactive emissions. Plutopia was successful because in its zoned-off isolation it appeared to deliver the promises of the American dream and Soviet communism; in reality, it concealed disasters that remain highly unstable and threatening today.An untold and profoundly important piece of Cold War history, Plutopia invites readers to consider the nuclear footprint left by the arms race and the enormous price of paying for it.",,,2013,April 5th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Russia', 'American History', 'Grad School', 'Reportage', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'United States']",,9780199855766,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358752376l/16248513.jpg,4.18,"['John H.

Kate Chopin,The Awakening,,English,,"When first published in 1899, The Awakening shocked readers with its honest treatment of female marital infidelity. Audiences accustomed to the pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and finds passionate physical love outside the confines of her domestic situation.Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities.

"Kate Chopin, Sandra M. Gilbert (Editor)",Complete Novels and Stories,,English,,"From ruined Louisiana plantations to bustling, cosmopolitan New Orleans, Kate Chopin wrote with unflinching honesty about propriety and its strictures, the illusions of love and the realities of marriage, and the persistence of a past scarred by slavery and war. Her stories of fiercely independent women, culminating in her masterpiece ""The Awakening"" (1899), challenged contemporary mores as much by their sensuousness as their politics, and today seem decades ahead of their time. Now, The Library of America collects all of Chopin's novels and stories as never before in one authoritative volume.  The explosive novel ""At Fault"" (1890) centers on a love triangle between a strong-willed young widow, a stiff St. Louis businessman, and the man's alcoholic wife. In the story collections ""Bayou Folk"" (1894) and ""A Night in Acadie"" (1897), Chopin transforms the local color sketch into taut, perfectly calibrated tales of post-Civil War bayou culture. In ""The Awakening,"" the now-classic novel that scandalized many of her contemporaries and effectively ended her writing career, Chopin tells the story of a restless, unsatisfied woman who embarks on a quixotic search for fulfillment.  The volume also includes all the stories not collected by Chopin, including those meant for ""A Vocation and a Voice,"" a projected volume that her publisher canceled in 1900, and three stories that were found in 1992 in a long-lost cache of Chopin's papers.",,,03/22/99,September 30th 2002,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Short Stories', 'American', 'Literature', 'Feminism', 'Novels', 'Classic Literature', '19th Century', 'Anthologies']",,9781931082211,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309212658l/16077.jpg,4.27,[],52.0,1.0,,16077.Complete_Novels_and_Stories,,,,,95.0,644.0,1075,,Library of America,"['321', '214', '80', '21', '8']",,,[],,

Stone in 1899. It has been annotated by the editor and includes translations of French phrases and information about New Orleans locales, customs, and lore, the Bayou region, and Creole culture. ""Bibliographical and Historical Contexts"", expanded and introduced by a new Editor's Note, presents biographical, historical, and cultural documents contemporary with the novel's publication.

Kate Christensen,The Epicure's Lament,,English,,"For ten years, Hugo Whittier, upper-class scion, former gigolo, failed belle lettriste, has been living a hermit's existence at Waverly, his family's crumbling mansion overlooking the Hudson. He passes the time reading Montaigne and M. F. K. Fisher, cooking himself delicious meals, smoking an endless number of cigarettes, and nursing a grudge against the world. But his older brother, Dennis, has returned, in retreat from an unhappy marriage, and so has his estranged wife, Sonia, and their (she claims) daughter Bellatrix, shattering Hugo's cherished solitude. He's also been told by a doctor that he has the rare Buerger's disease, which means that unless he stops smoking, he will die—all the more reason for Hugo to light up, because his quarrel with life is bitter and an early death is a most attractive prospect. As Hugo smokes and cooks and sexually schemes and pokes his perverse nose into other people's marriages and business, he records these events as well as his mordant, funny, gorgeously articulated personal history and his thoughts on life and mortality in a series of notebooks. His is one of the most perversely compelling literary personalities to inhabit a novel since John Lanchester's The Debt to Pleasure, and his ancestors include the divinely cracked and eloquent narrators of the works of Nabokov. As snobbish and dislikable as Hugo is, his worldview is so seductively conveyed that even the most resistant readers will be put under his spell. His insinuating voice gets into their heads and under their skin in the most seductive way. And as he prepares what may be his final Christmas feast for family and friends, readers will have to ask, ""Isthis the end of Hugo?""Imagine the book the young hero of the independent film hit Igby Goes Down might write twenty-five years from now, and you'll get an idea of the powerfully peculiar charm of The Epicure's Lament.",,,02/17/04,January 25th 2005,['Hugo Whittier'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Food', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Female Authors', 'Humor', 'Modern', 'Foodie']",,9780385720984,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347454494l/148216.jpg,3.73,[],96.0,1.0,,148216.The_Epicure_s_Lament,,,,,89.0,1333.0,351,,Anchor,"['317', '517', '352', '111', '36']",,,[],,

And even as Liath struggles with magic's seductive spell, Sanglant's Aoi mother returns to the mortal world, seeking the son she abandoned as a babe.As the fates of kingdoms shift with the changing fortunes of those caught up in the dangers of both civil war and continuing attacks by the nonhuman Eika and the Quman invaders, time is running out for Liath, Sanglant, King Henry, and the people of Wendar and Varre. For the time of cataclysm is fast approaching--and no one can foretell who will survive--or rule--when it is over....",Crown of Stars #3,,10/30/99,August 1st 2000,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction']",,9780886778156,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388182003l/202087.jpg,3.84,[],181.0,2.0,,202087.The_Burning_Stone,,,,,93.0,4969.0,801,,Daw Books,"['1393', '1803', '1435', '272', '66']",,,[],,

In the up-front and honest style that has become the trademark of their blogs, they share with readers twenty-seven ways to reframe notions of dieting and weight, including: accepting that diets don't work, practicing intuitive eating, finding body-positive doctors, not judging other women, and finding a hobby that has nothing to do with one's weight.",,,10/30/09,May 5th 2009,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Health', 'Self Help', 'Fat Acceptance', 'Fat', 'Fat Studies', 'Womens Studies', 'Essays', 'Memoir']",,9780399534973,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442537028l/5552212._SX318_.jpg,4.02,[],99.0,1.0,,5552212-lessons-from-the-fat-o-sphere,,,,,93.0,843.0,252,,Tarcherperigee,"['318', '298', '168', '47', '12']",,,[],,

Flouting convention and defying the law in the name of women's reproductive rights, Axie rises from grim tenement rooms to the splendor of a mansion on Fifth Avenue, amassing wealth while learning over and over never to trust a man who says ""trust me.""When her services attract outraged headlines, Axie finds herself on a collision course with a crusading official, Anthony Comstock, founder of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. It will take all of Axie's cunning and power to outwit him in the fight to preserve her freedom and everything she holds dear.Inspired by the true history of an infamous female physician who was once called ""the Wickedest Woman in New York,"" My Notorious Life is a mystery, a family saga, a love story, and an exquisitely detailed portrait of nineteenth-century America.

  The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger
The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these ""shining girls"" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption.

Kate Mosse,Sepulchre,,English,,"In 1891, young Léonie Vernier and her brother Anatole arrive in the beautiful town of Rennes-les-Bains, in southwest France. They've come at the invitation of their widowed aunt, whose mountain estate, Domain de la Cade, is famous in the region. But it soon becomes clear that their aunt Isolde-and the Domain-are not what Léonie had imagined. The villagers claim that Isolde's late husband died after summoning a demon from the old Visigoth sepulchre high on the mountainside. A book from the Domain's cavernous library describes the strange tarot pack that mysteriously disappeared following the uncle's death. But while Léonie delves deeper into the ancient mysteries of the Domain, a different evil stalks her family-one which may explain why Léonie and Anatole were invited to the sinister Domain in the first place.More than a century later, Meredith Martin, an American graduate student, arrives in France to study the life of Claude Debussy, the nineteenth century French composer. In Rennesles-Bains, Meredith checks into a grand old hotel-the Domain de la Cade. Something about the hotel feels eerily familiar, and strange dreams and visions begin to haunt Meredith's waking hours. A chance encounter leads her to a pack of tarot cards painted by Léonie Vernier, which may hold the key to this twenty-first century American's fate . . . just as they did to the fate of Léonie Vernier more than a century earlier.",Languedoc #2,,,October 31st 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'France', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Supernatural']",,9780752860558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601655340l/498835.jpg,3.76,[],863.0,11.0,,498835.Sepulchre,,,,,90.0,18705.0,560,,Orion,"['4792', '6936', '5154', '1431', '392']",,,[],,

Kate Mulgrew,Born With Teeth,,English,,"Raised by unconventional Irish Catholics who knew ""how to drink, how to dance, how to talk, and how to stir up the devil,"" Kate Mulgrew grew up with poetry and drama in her bones. But in her mother, a would-be artist burdened by the endless arrival of new babies, young Kate saw the consequences of a dream deferred. Determined to pursue her own no matter the cost, at 18 she left her small Midwestern town for New York, where, studying with the legendary Stella Adler, she learned the lesson that would define her as an actress: ""Use it,"" Adler told her. Whatever disappointment, pain, or anger life throws in your path, channel it into the work.It was a lesson she would need. At twenty-two, just as her career was taking off, she became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. Having already signed the adoption papers, she was allowed only a fleeting glimpse of her child. As her star continued to rise, her life became increasingly demanding and fulfilling, a whirlwind of passionate love affairs, life-saving friendships, and bone-crunching work. Through it all, Mulgrew remained haunted by the loss of her daughter, until, two decades later, she found the courage to face the past and step into the most challenging role of her life, both on and off screen.We know Kate Mulgrew for the strong women she's played--Captain Janeway on Star Trek; the tough-as-nails ""Red"" on Orange is the New Black. Now, we meet the most inspiring and memorable character of all: herself.

Kate Summerscale,The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher,,English,,"The dramatic story of the real-life murder that inspired the birth of modern detective fiction. In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit. The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection, ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking, as Kate Summerscale relates in her scintillating new book, that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher. Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable—that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today…from the cryptic Sgt. Cuff in Wilkie Collins’s The Moonstone to Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade.

V Hamburku pracuje ve výzkumném centru spánku, sama však ne a ne usnout. A tak má po nocích spoustu času na vzpomínání: na to, jak před sedmnácti lety strávila jedno osudové léto v rodné vesnici Grund, obklopené rozvětveným tokem Rýna a hustými lesy. To léto prožila se svým nejlepším přítelem Andreasem a Lutzem, první velkou láskou. Na podzim toho roku Ellen zjistí, že je těhotná. Lutz ale zmizel. A Andreas oněměl. Do Grundu se Ellen i se svou dcerou vrací až po sedmnácti letech ve chvíli, kdy její matka umírá. Tajemství minulosti začínají pomalu vyplouvat na povrch. Ellen se znovu zamiluje, tentokrát do náměsíčného Benna – historika, který v grundských lesích pátrá po stopách vojáka, jenž se tu za války ukrýval.

Katharine Kerr (Goodreads Author),The Black Raven,,,,"The Black Raven is Book Two of The Dragon Mage and the 10th volume of the Deverry series, a fantasy epic consisting of three interrelated quartets. As Katherine Kerr says, the past and the present are woven together in these novels, and the final volume will link with the first to reveal an overall design akin to a Celtic knot threading back and forth upon itself. This is a strange, pseudo-Celtic world in which reincarnation is a reality and past lives forever affect the present in surprising and unexpected ways. So, while The Black Raven can stand alone, it is advisable that readers begin with the first book, Daggerspell.  In this complex novel of civil war, sacrifice, and power, what impresses most is that Kerr uses an epic canvas to tell a strongly characterized and very human tale of hatred and destructive evil, and of the consequences of past malevolence on both the heroine Lilli and the Prince Maryn. By keeping the narrative tightly focused around a small number of characters, and by maintaining strict limits on the rather elaborately conceived elements of magic and the supernatural, Katherine Kerr ensures that her fantastical history does not overwhelm the more personal and affecting dimensions of the tale. The result is a polished, emotionally involving, and powerful novel in which even the dreams of a dragon may come evocatively to life. --Gary S.

Katherine Ann Meyer,Grosvenor Square,,English,,"Untitled Document An engaging, romantic, provocative homage to the 19th-century novel. Amid the genteel charms of 19th-century London's elegant Mayfair district, the Hathaways take up residence in Grosvenor Square. With an increasing fortune, refined upbringing, and fashionable social circle, the close-knit family seems assured of a bright and comfortable future. But their idyllic world is disrupted by the arrival of Jasper Munroe, a distant relation who touches off a series of unsettling events that will change their lives forever. The Hathaway siblings - spirited Lorna, gentle Tom, and beautiful Rosamond - are led down divergent paths of self-discovery, both virtuous and destructive, as each learns about love, loss, and the price of preserving the ties that bind. In a story of beauty and philosophy, romance and heartache, betrayal and redemption, Grosvenor Square explores the intricacies of human relationships and raises significant questions about the extent to which lives are shaped not only by individual choice, but just as compellingly, by the influence of others. Stylistically reflective of the Victorian novelists to whom it pays tribute, Grosvenor Square reveals a poignant narrative embedded with a relevant social commentary.""Seamlessly blending 19th-century history with captivating storytelling, Katherine Ann Meyer has created an engaging story written with vivid detail and authenticity. Grosvenor Square will take you on a memorable journey. You won't want to put it down.""

So when she happens upon a crazed woman at the river threatening to throw a book into the water, Ollie doesn't think--she just acts, stealing the book and running away. As she begins to read the slender volume, Ollie discovers a chilling story about a girl named Beth, the two brothers who both loved her, and a peculiar deal made with ""the smiling man,"" a sinister specter who grants your most tightly held wish, but only for the ultimate price. Ollie is captivated by the tale until her school trip the next day to Smoke Hollow, a local farm with a haunting history all its own. There she stumbles upon the graves of the very people she's been reading about. Could it be the story about the smiling man is true? Ollie doesn't have too long to think about the answer to that. On the way home, the school bus breaks down, sending their teacher back to the farm for help. But the strange bus driver has some advice for the kids left behind in his care: ""Best get moving. At nightfall they'll come for the rest of you."" Nightfall is, indeed, fast descending when Ollie's previously broken digital wristwatch, a keepsake reminder of better times, begins a startling countdown and delivers a terrifying message: RUN. Only Ollie and two of her classmates heed the bus driver's warning. As the trio head out into the woods--bordered by a field of scarecrows that seem to be watching them--the bus driver has just one final piece of advice for Ollie and her friends: ""Avoid large places.

Katherine Boo,"Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity",,English,,"From Pulitzer Prize-winner Katherine Boo, a landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century's great, unequal cities.In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human. Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees ""a fortune beyond counting"" in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter - Annawadi's ""most-everything girl"" - will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call ""the full enjoy."" But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi. With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century's hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.",,,,February 7th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Asia', 'Poverty', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Sociology', 'Adult']",,9781400067558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315601232l/11869272.jpg,3.98,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2013)', 'National Book Award for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2012)', 'PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction (2013)', 'Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism (2013)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Current Interest (2012)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2012)', 'Ryszard Kapuściński Prize Nominee (2013)', 'NAIBA Book of the Year for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2012)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)']",404.0,5.0,,11869272-behind-the-beautiful-forevers,,,,,93.0,98620.0,278,,Random House,"['33177', '39191', '19117', '5116', '2019']",,,['Mumbai (India)'],,

Katherine Frank (Goodreads Author),Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi,,English,,"On the morning of October 31, 1984, as she walked through her garden, smiling, with hands raised and palms pressed together in the traditional Indian namaste greeting, Indira Nehru Gandhi was assassinated by her own bodyguards. She died as she had lived, surrounded by men, yet isolated. It was a violent end to a life of epic drama. Here is the first popular biography of one of the world's most influential leaders, India's third prime minister. Brought up during an era that saw the rise of Indian nationalism, Indira was raised to be what her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, called ""a child of revolution"" - destined to play a political role in the creation and governing of an independent India. Despite her early reluctance to embrace this role, Indira eventually presided over a huge, complex, religiously riven, and male-dominated country. She was born to a wealthy, westernized family, but she had a gift for connecting with the poor of the countryside and the urban slums, the illiterate, the dispossessed - so much so that ""Indira is India"" became a familiar slogan. Throughout childhood, love, marriage, imprisonment, motherhood, and a sequence of personal and family tragedies, her personal hopes and desires were continually subsumed by the historical and political imperatives of her country. In this beautifully written book, the acclaimed biographer Katherine Frank draws on unpublished sources and more than a hundred interviews to create a rich, balanced portrait. INDIRA captures in full color the personal and political fate of the leader of the world's largest democracy - the woman who played a dominant role in the history of the twentieth century and who, when it ended, was voted Woman of the Millennium by the BBC.",,,10/30/01,2002,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'India', 'History', 'Politics', 'Indian Literature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Womens', 'Asia']",,9780395730973,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387701553l/290376.jpg,4.0,['Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2001)'],122.0,2.0,,290376.Indira,,,,,94.0,1974.0,592,,Houghton Mifflin,"['677', '784', '388', '80', '45']",,,[],,

But Cinhil was a cloistered monk, hidden under his religious name in one of many monasteries, unaware of his heritage, untrained in politics. Could he be persuaded to leave the only life he knew and take on the leadership of a rebellion? And lacking the Deryni powers, could he hope to overcome the magic of the king?

Virginia Woolf  Virginia Woolf was not the only writer to admire Mansfield's work: Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence, and Elizabeth Bowen all praised her stories, and her early death at the age of thirty-four cut short one of the finest short-story writers in the English language.  This selection covers the full range of Mansfield's fiction, from her early satirical stories to the subtly nuanced comedy of 'The Daughters of the Late Colonel' and the macabre and ominous 'A Married Man's Story'. The stories that pay what Mansfield calls 'a debt of love' to New Zealand are as sharply etched as the European stories, and she recreates her childhood world with mordant insight. Disruption is a constant theme, whether the tone is comic, tragic, nostalgic, or domestic, echoing Mansfield's disrupted life and the fractured expressions of Modernism.

Challenging each, such as Descartes' idea that humans have a discrete consciousness and can alter creation while remaining unaltered themselves, she reveals why such divisions don't tally with the values expressed daily in the way people live.

A magician stole her family's few valuables and left Sadima's mother to die on the day Sadima was born.

Kathleen E. Woodiwiss,Everlasting,,English,,"Historical romance was born when the remarkable Kathleen E. Woodiwiss gifted the world with her groundbreaking love story, The Flame and the Flower. Now, twelve consecutive New York Times bestsellers later, ""the first lady of the genre"" (Publishers Weekly) returns with her most breathtaking masterwork to date—a glorious celebration of a secret love that is dangerous, irresistible, forbidden, and . . .Once, Abrielle's name was on the lips of every unwed nobleman in London as a proud exceptional lady coveted for her bearing, her breeding, her wit, and her beauty.But when her stepfather—respected for his courage and valor during the Crusades—is denied his rightful title and the wealth that accompanies it, Abrielle finds herself suddenly disgraced, no longer a suitable match for any proper gentleman. Only one would still have her, though he desires no more than physical pleasure: the oafish and grotesque Desmond de Marlé. His dark and scandalous reputation is legend, and Abrielle has heard rumors that his first two wives perished by his hand. Yet no one else can rescue her once-proud family's honor and keep her stepfather from debtor's prison, so she is left with no choice but to accept the cruel and hateful de Marlé's offer of marriage and sacrifice her virtue to a scoundrel she fears and detests . . . even as she yearns for another lover.Dashing, handsome, tall, and kind—a black-haired Scotsman with vivid blue eyes—Raven Seabern is an emissary for his king, and quite unlike any man Abrielle has ever encountered. From the very first moment their eyes meet, he intrigues and mesmerizes her—and dancing in his arms at a royal banquet leaves her weak with the desire to surrender. But their love can never be, for Abrielle is betrothed to a monster. And the well-being of everyone she cares for demands that she honor her promise. Still, the fire lit that night will not be doused. Raven knows he has found the true one and must never let her go—though secrets, deceptions, dishonor, and unimaginable peril will surely be their fate if they follow the dictates of their hearts.",,,,October 30th 2007,"['Raven Seabern', 'Abrielle']",Hardcover,"['Romance', 'Historical Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Medieval', 'British Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Medieval Romance', 'Chick Lit']",,9780060545529,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428314606l/603387.jpg,3.57,[],196.0,2.0,,603387.Everlasting,,,,,83.0,3407.0,336,,William Morrow,"['869', '930', '1040', '398', '170']",,,[],,

Maureen's extraordinary journey takes her from the dusty streets of Jerusalem to the cathedrals of Paris . . . and ultimately to search for the scrolls themselves. She must unravel clues that link history's great artistic masters, including Sandro Botticelli, Nicolas Poussin, and Jean Cocteau; the Medici, Bourbon, and Borgia dynasties; and great scientific minds like Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton. Ultimately, she, and the reader, come face-to-face with Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist, Judas, and Salome in the pages of a deeply moving and powerful new gospel, the life of Jesus as told by Mary Magdalene.",Magdalene Line Trilogy #1,,10/28/04,July 25th 2006,"['Salome', 'Pontius Pilate', 'Claudia Procula', 'Maureen Paschal', 'Berenger Sinclair', 'Tamara Wisdom', 'Roland Gelis', 'Jesus']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Religion', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'France', 'Biblical']",,9780743299428,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437064132l/278210._SY475_.jpg,3.91,[],386.0,5.0,,278210.The_Expected_One,,,,,90.0,7247.0,449,,Touchstone,"['2571', '2438', '1516', '489', '233']",,,"['France', 'Judea', 'Rome (Italy)']",,

Kathleen Norris,Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith,,English,,"Struggling with her return to the Christian church after many years away, Kathleen Norris found it was the language of Christianity that most distanced her from faith. Words like ""judgment,"" ""faith,"" ""dogma,"" ""salvation,"" ""sinner""—even ""Christ""—formed what she called her ""scary vocabulary,"" words that had become so codified or abstract that their meanings were all but impenetrable. She found she had to wrestle with them and make them her own before they could confer their blessings and their grace. Blending history, theology, storytelling, etymology, and memoir, Norris uses these words as a starting point for reflection, and offers a moving account of her own gradual conversion. She evokes a rich spirituality rooted firmly in the chaos of everyday life—and offers believers and doubters alike an illuminating perspective on how we can embrace ancient traditions and find faith in the contemporary world.",,,January 1st 1998,April 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Memoir', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Faith', 'Theology', 'Essays', 'Biography']",,9781573227216,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394410645l/106613.jpg,4.04,['Society of Midland Authors Award Nominee for Adult Nonfiction (2000)'],2.0,1.0,,106613.Amazing_Grace,,,,,92.0,6164.0,384,,Riverhead Books,"['2430', '2218', '1026', '307', '183']",,,[],,

She's even managed to keep her painful secrets hidden from her loving husband, dutiful children, and large extended family.When a stagnant weather pattern traps poisonous mill gasses in the valley, neighbors grow sicker and Rose's nursing obligations thrust her into conflict she never could have fathomed. Consequences from her past collide with her present life, making her once clear decisions as gray as the suffocating smog. As pressure mounts, Rose finds she's not the only one harboring lies.

"Kathleen Thompson Norris, Jennie Chancey (Editor)",Mother,,English,,"This is a difficult age to be a woman. The woman who aspires to raise children for the glory of God, to develop the ministry of the home, or to co-labor with her husband is deemed “old-fashioned” or “unfulfilled.” The modern lure of independence and career has bewitched an entire generation to exchange the beauty of Christian womanhood for the temporary enticements of a society at war with the family.Amidst this confusion, Kathleen Norris’s Mother is a refreshing call to sanity. Mother is the fictional tale of a young lady who leaves home and repudiates family life in the hope of finding personal fulfillment through independence and a career. She decides that home life is a poor choice in the face of life in the big city. But God dramatically changes her heart as she realizes that wealth and position are illusory and that independence can enslave a young lady. She discovers that the greatest woman she has ever known is her mother and now she longs for home and motherhood.After reading this book, editor Jennie Chancey wrote, “That night, I opened the book, intending to read a chapter or two before bed. An hour passed before I realized how far I had read. I could not put the book down and finished it just shortly before midnight. As I turned the last page, tears filled my eyes. I knelt by my bed and asked God to forgive me for my bitterness and my unwillingness to trust and obey Him.”Vision Forum is pleased to offer this restored and revised version of the 1911 classic in the hope that girls will once again aspire to be like their mothers.This book may also be known as ""Belle-Mere"" as Triangle Books has such a title listed under this author's name.",,,10/30/11,October 1st 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Historical', 'Parenting', 'Inspirational', 'Family', 'Chick Lit']",,9781929241170,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347488527l/880529.jpg,3.95,[],127.0,2.0,,880529.Mother,,,,,89.0,1526.0,202,,Vision Forum,"['635', '407', '319', '102', '63']",,,['United States of America'],,

In 1968, into the devastating, spare atmosphere of Labrador, Canada, a child is born: a baby who appears to be neither fully boy nor fully girl, but both at once. Only three people are privy to the secret—the baby’s parents, Jacinta and Treadway, and their trusted neighbor and midwife, Thomasina. Though Treadway makes the difficult decision to raise the child as a boy named Wayne, the women continue to quietly nurture the boy’s female side. And as Wayne grows into adulthood within the hypermasculine hunting society of his father, his shadow-self, a girl he thinks of as “Annabel,” is never entirely extinguished. When Wayne finally escapes the confines of his hometown and settles in St. John’s, the anonymity of the city grants him the freedom to confront his dual identity. His ultimate choice will once again call into question the integrity and allegiance of those he loves most. Kathleen Winter has crafted a literary gem about the urge to unveil mysterious truth in a culture that shuns contradiction, and the body’s insistence on coming home.

Kathleen Zamboni McCormick (Goodreads Author),"Dodging Satan: My Irish/Italian, Sometimes Awesome, But Mostly Creepy, Childhood",,English,,"In this humorous coming-of-age story, Bridget Flagherty, a student at St. Michael’s Catholic school outside Boston in the 60s and 70s, takes refuge in her wacky misunderstandings of Bible Stories and Catholic beliefs to avoid the problems of her Irish/Italian family life. Her musings on sadistic nuns, domestic violence, emerging sexuality, and God the Father’s romantic life will delight readers. Bridget creates glorious supernatural worlds—with exorcisms, bird relics, Virgin Martyrs, time travel, Biblical plagues, even the ‘holy’ in holy water—to cope with a family where leather handbags and even garlic can cause explosions. An avid Bible reader who innocently believes everything the nuns tell her, Bridget’s saints, martyrs, and boney Christs become alive and audible within her. While the nuns chide her sinful ‘mathematical pride’ and slow eating habits, God answers her prayers instantly by day, but the devil visits nightly in the dark. Scenes run the gamut from laugh-out-loud Catholic brainwashing of children, to heart-wrenching abuse, to riveting teenage excursions toward sex. Young Bridget tries to make sense of a world of raging men and domestically subjugated women and carve a future for herself, wrestling with how God and men treat women. Her Italian female relatives—glamorous Santa Anna, black-and-blue Aunt Maria, sophisticated Eleanor with a New York ‘Fellini pageboy’—offer sensual alternatives to the repression of her immediate family. She prays fervently that “despite God’s bizarre treatment of married women... some [girls] might still discover ways to have a great time without being a nun.” Dodging Satan is the flip-side of l'Histoire d'une Âme by Saint Thérèse of Lisieux authored by a twentieth century American girl chomping on a blue-gum cigar while she talks to a confidant about God and sex.",,,,November 18th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Book Club', 'Epic', 'Fiction', 'Novels']",,B0187OW2OM,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448816156l/28009303._SY475_.jpg,4.31,"['Independent Press Award for Humor & Wit (2020)', 'Rubery Book Award Shortlisted (2020)']",5879.0,65.0,,28009303-dodging-satan,,,,,96.0,4525.0,191,,Sand Hill Review Press,"['2036', '2084', '225', '125', '55']",,,[],,

But evil lurks in the owl world, and Soren is captured and imprisoned in a dark canyon where there is a mysterious school. It's called an orphanage, but Soren believes it's something far worse. He and his new friend, the clever and scrappy Gylfie, know that the only way out is up. To escape, they will need to do something these fledglings have never done before--fly.

Kathryn Springer (Goodreads Author),The Hearts We Mend,,English,,"Planning and Post-It notes are the epitome of Evie’s life. But when she meets Jack, her life gets more than a little complicated.Thirteen years ago, Evie's firefighter husband was killed in the line of duty, leaving her to raise their young son, Cody, alone. Now, Cody is marrying the love of his life, and as he packs up his belongings, the house feels as empty as Evie's heart. But for all her planning and mad organizational skills, Evie could never have anticipated the dramatic shift her life is about to make.Tattooed, rough-around-the-edges Jack raises quite a few eyebrows in the tight-knit community of Banister Falls. Where Evie's life is stream-lined, Jack's approach to living is moment by moment. But as Evie gets drawn into Jack's world—a world that isn't as safe or predictable as the one she's worked so hard to create—he challenges her to open her eyes to the problems outside the walls of the church.  Jack doesn't make Evie feel comfortable, but he definitely makes her feel something.

Kathryn Stockett (Goodreads Author),The Help,,English,,"Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereThree ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Kathy Griffin,Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin,,English,,"Official Book Club Selection is Kathy Griffin unplugged, uncensored, and unafraid to dish about what really happens on the road, away from the cameras, and at the star party after the show. (It's also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she's always wanted. Are you there, Oprah? It's me, Kathy.)Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, been nominated for a Grammy, worked and walked every red carpet known to man, and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy's sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit, the feisty comic settles a few old scores, celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top, and shares insider gossip about celebrity behavior–the good, the bad, and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or, in some cases, after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you've ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life, check the index for your name.Along the way, Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A., from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce, and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up, how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house, and which people in Kathy's life have taught her the most valuable lessons–both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn't enough, there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy's own collection–featuring the diva of the D List herself, with her old nose as well as her new one, plus celebrity friends, foes, frenemies, and hangers-on for you to gawk at.Refreshingly candid, unflinchingly honest, and full of hilarious ""Did she really say that?"" moments, Official Book Club Selection will make you laugh until you cry, or just puke up a little bit.",,,01/01/09,September 8th 2009,"['Kathy Griffin', 'Oprah', 'Andy Dick', 'Brooke Shields']",Hardcover,"['Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Comedian', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Womens', 'Pop Culture']",,9780345518514,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428806540l/6534932.jpg,3.79,[],84.0,1.0,,6534932-official-book-club-selection,,,,,89.0,36605.0,348,,Ballantine Books,"['11170', '12283', '9144', '2419', '1589']",,,[],,

While cleaning out Jake's room, Noah and Jake's dad make a startling discovery. Instead of the obligatory porn collection or pot stash, they find a ring, but not just any ring.

Katie Roiphe,Still She Haunts Me,,English,,"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was a shy Oxford mathematician, reverend, and pioneering photographer. Under the pen name Lewis Carroll he wrote two stunning classics that liberated children’s literature from the constraints of Victorian moralism. But the exact nature of his relationship with Alice Liddell, daughter of the dean of his college, and the young girl who was his muse and subject, remains mysterious. Dodgson met Alice in 1856, when she was almost four years old. Eventually he would capture her in his photographs, and transform the stories he told her into the luminous Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking-Glass. Then, suddenly, when Alice was eleven, the Liddell family shut him out, and his relationship with Alice ended abruptly. The pages from Dodgson’s diary that may have explained the rift have disappeared. In imagining what might have happened, Katie Roiphe has created a deep, textured portrait of Alice and Dodgson: she changing from an unruly child to a bewitching adolescent, and he, a diffident, neurasthenic adult whose increasing obsession with her almost destroys him. Here, too, is a brilliantly realized cast of characters that surround them: Lorina Liddell, Alice’s mother, who loves her daughter even as she envies her youth; Edith Liddell, Alice’s resentful little sister; and James Hunt, Dodgson’s speech therapist, an island of sanity in Dodgson’s increasingly chaotic world.",,,11/06/01,October 1st 2002,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'Fantasy']",,9780385335300,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320487697l/107974.jpg,3.4,[],88.0,1.0,,107974.Still_She_Haunts_Me,,,,,82.0,421.0,240,,Delta,"['69', '121', '154', '62', '15']",,,[],,

Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like play, design, and interactivity. They look at games through a series of eighteen game design schemas, or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers,  Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.",,,,September 25th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Game Design', 'Games', 'Nonfiction', 'Design', 'Video Games', 'Gaming', 'Reference', 'Research', 'Education', 'Unfinished']",,0000262240459,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347345749l/176698.jpg,3.98,[],79.0,1.0,,176698.Rules_of_Play,,,,,93.0,864.0,688,,MIT Press,"['316', '303', '181', '41', '23']",,,[],,

Katrin Saali Saul (Goodreads Author),Naiseks olemise kunst,,Estonian,,"Rahvasuu naljatab, et Jumal, kes oli maailmaloomise protsessis mehe valmis meisterdanud, silmitses teda hetke ja mõtles: „Ma suudan paremini.“ Ning tegi naise. Väeline naine on jumaliku loomingu kauneim meistritöö. Kuidas aga elada oma elu selliseks, et jumalik läte naises ei kuivaks, et sära aastatega ei tuhmuks, vaid väge tuleks vanusega juurde? Et sellest väest saaks toitu enesehinnang, mis on kõikide suhete aluseks? Selline elu on kunst. Naise süvamaailma allhoovuseid, mis juhivad ta mõtlemist, tundmusi ja käitumist, võib kutsuda naise arhetüüpideks. Eluterved arhetüübid muudavad naise väeliseks, variarhetüübid kahandavad ta väetiks. Arhetüübid – Tütarlaps, Armastaja, Perenaine ja Kuninganna – avalduvad naise elu erinevates tahkudes. Tütarlaps toob naise ellu emotsionaalsuse, elurõõmu, mängu ja liikuvuse, tantsu ja spordi. Sensuaalse Armastaja abil astub naine füüsilisse kontakti mehega. Perenaine kannab naise elus hoolt tema perekondlike suhete, koduhoiu, puhtuse ja enda sisemise maailma hoidmise eest. Kuninganna ilmneb suhetes välismaailmaga, oma väärtuse teadmises ning oma seisukohtade selges ja julges avaldamises. Arhetüüpide palett on igal naisel sünnihetkel olemas, see on justkui tema Ürgnaise kood, mis peaks tagama täisverelise elu. Paraku juhtub elu käigus sageli, et naine hälbib elutervetest arhetüüpidest variarhetüüpide küüsi. Temas on eluterve arhetüübi energiat kas liiga vähe või vastupidi, liiga palju. Mis on need põhjused, miks naine kaotab kontakti väeliste arhetüüpidega? Milliseid arhetüüpe mehed suhetes naistega otsivad? Milliseid arhetüüpe vajab naine suhete õnnestumiseks? Millised variarhetüübid toovad garanteeritult kinnijäämise negatiivsetesse emotsioonidesse? „Naiseks olemise kunst“ viib lugeja naise psüühika inglite ja deemonite – arhetüüpide ja variarhetüüpide – juurde. Lootuses, et varjupoolte teadvustamise ja elutervete arhetüüpide väljendamise kaudu saab naine uurida end uuest vaatevinklist ja parema kunstilise tulemuse nimel ehk muuta oma elu.Raamatu süvapsühholoogiline sisu on esitatud erakordselt lihtsalt ja selgelt ning see on põnev lugemistükk neilegi, kes akadeemilisest psühholoogiast kauge kaarega mööda käivad. Katrin Saali Saul on suurepärane jutustaja, tema mahlakas keel ja võrratud kujundid avavad naise hingeelu salasoppe sügavamalt kui keegi eales varem on suutnud teha. Igaühel on siit midagi võtta. See on suurepärane käsiraamat naistele, kes on parasjagu iseendaga vaenujalal või vajavad suhete klaarimise õpetust, rõõmuks neile, kes eluga kenasti hakkama saavad, kuid vajavad juurde vürtsi ja värvi.

She also knows that Bishop and the SCU have to be desperate to rely on an untried psychic agent in an undercover operation so dangerous. And desperate they are. For the killer they're hunting is the most terrifying they've ever faced and shakes even the most seasoned agents: a soulless megalomaniacal cult leader who can use their own weapons, talents, and tactics against them. By entering the cult's well-guarded compound, Tessa will be exposing herself to the dark magnetism of a psychopath on an apocalyptic crusade of terror that spares no one, not even the youngest victims. And Samuel has protected himself within a fanatically loyal congregation, many of whom occupy surprising positions of power within the community.

Kazuo Ishiguro,Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall,,English,,"One of the most celebrated writers of our time gives us his first cycle of short fiction: five brilliantly etched, interconnected stories in which music is a vivid and essential character. A once-popular singer, desperate to make a comeback, turning from the one certainty in his life . . . A man whose unerring taste in music is the only thing his closest friends value in him . . . A struggling singer-songwriter unwittingly involved in the failing marriage of a couple he’s only just met . . . A gifted, underappreciated jazz musician who lets himself believe that plastic surgery will help his career . . . A young cellist whose tutor promises to “unwrap” his talent . . . Passion or necessity—or the often uneasy combination of the two—determines the place of music in each of these lives. And, in one way or another, music delivers each of them to a moment of reckoning: sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, sometimes just eluding their grasp.

Kazuo Ishiguro,Never Let Me Go,,English,,"From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.",,,04/11/05,08/31/10,"['Kathy H.', 'Ruth', 'Tommy']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'British Literature']",,9781400078776,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353048590l/6334.jpg,3.82,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2005)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best SF Novel (2006)', 'Arthur C.

Keigo Higashino,Böse Absichten,,German,,"Am Tatort erkennt Kommissar Kyochiro Kaga den besten Freund des Ermordeten wieder. Vor vielen Jahren unterrichteten er und Nonoguchi gemeinsam an einer öffentlichen Schule. Kaga ging in den Polizeidienst, während Nonoguchi den Lehrerberuf an den Nagel hängte, um sich mit mäßigem Erfolg dem Schreiben zu widmen. Im Laufe der Ermittlungen findet Kaga Hinweise, dass die Beziehung der beiden Schriftsteller alles andere als freundschaftlich war. Doch die eigentliche Frage ist nicht wer oder wie, sondern warum. Wenn Kaga kein Motiv für den Mord nachweisen kann, wird die Wahrheit nie ans Licht kommen. In einem brillanten Katz-und-Maus-Spiel kämpfen der Kommissar und der Killer um die Vergangenheit und den tatsächlichen Tathergang.---------------Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he’s planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, a locked room, within his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock solid alibis. Or so it seems.At the crime scene, Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga recognizes Hidaka’s best friend, Osamu Nonoguchi. Years ago when they were both teachers, they were colleagues at the same public school. Kaga went on to join the police force while Nonoguchi eventually left to become a full-time writer, though with not nearly the success of his friend Hidaka. As Kaga investigates, he eventually uncovers evidence that indicates that the two writers’ relationship was very different that they claimed, that they were anything but best friends.  But the question before Kaga isn't necessarily who, or how, but why. In a brilliantly realized tale of cat and mouse, the detective and the killer battle over the truth of the past and how events that led to the murder really unfolded. And if Kaga isn't able to uncover and prove why the murder was committed, then the truth may never come out.",Kyoichiro Kaga #4,,September 1996,May 23rd 2015,[],Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Crime', 'Japanese Literature', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective', 'Asia', 'Suspense']",,9783608980271,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431272495l/25516329.jpg,3.97,['Audie Award Nominee for Mystery (2015)'],16.0,1.0,,25516329-b-se-absichten,,,,,96.0,11623.0,255,,Klett-Cotta,"['3203', '5418', '2553', '380', '69']",,,[],,

Instead, what might prove somewhat difficult to overcome is the school’s strict policy concerning on-campus relationships.All sexual contact is expressly forbidden.

While the film was selling out movie theaters, young black gay men were literally committing suicide in the silence of their own communities.When a young Rutgers University student named Tyler Clementi took his own life after a roommate secretly videotaped him in an intimate setting with another young man, syndicated columnist and author Dan Savage created a YouTube video with his partner Terry to inspire young people facing harassment.

The book tells stories of real people coming of age, coming out, dealing with religion and spirituality, seeking love and relationships, finding their own identity in or out of the LGBT community, and creating their own sense of political empowerment.

Dr. Donohue in this important new study considers all of O'Nolan's work including college writings, letters to the editor(raised to a form of national genius by F O'B.) and works in Irish. It draws upon the research and biographical material of Anthony Cronin's No Laughing Matter, along with new research and criticism and takes issue with some of the conclusions reached in Keith Hopper's A Portrait of a Postmodernist. By tracing O'Nolan's development as an artist over time, this new study uncovers the relentless anatomist and post modernist in Flann O'Brien, a man of genius dissecting and exposing life and custom in mid 20th century Dublin.

Keith Donohue (Goodreads Author),The Stolen Child,,English,,"Inspired by the W.B. Yeats poem that tempts a child from home to the waters and the wild, The Stolen Child is a modern fairy tale narrated by the child Henry Day and his double.On a summer night, Henry Day runs away from home and hides in a hollow tree. There he is taken by the changelings—an unaging tribe of wild children who live in darkness and in secret. They spirit him away, name him Aniday, and make him one of their own. Stuck forever as a child, Aniday grows in spirit, struggling to remember the life and family he left behind. He also seeks to understand and fit in this shadow land, as modern life encroaches upon both myth and nature.In his place, the changelings leave a double, a boy who steals Henry’s life in the world. This new Henry Day must adjust to a modern culture while hiding his true identity from the Day family. But he can’t hide his extraordinary talent for the piano (a skill the true Henry never displayed), and his dazzling performances prompt his father to suspect that the son he has raised is an imposter. As he ages the new Henry Day becomes haunted by vague but persistent memories of life in another time and place, of a German piano teacher and his prodigy. Of a time when he, too, had been a stolen child. Both Henry and Aniday obsessively search for who they once were before they changed places in the world.The Stolen Child is a classic tale of leaving childhood and the search for identity.

Published in 1951 and intended by Salinger for adults (early drafts were published in the New Yorker and Colliers), the novel quickly became championed by youth who identified with the awkwardness and alienation of the novel’s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Since then the book and its reclusive author have been fixtures of both popular and literary culture. Catcher is perhaps the only modern novel that is revered equally by the countless Americans whom Holden Caulfield helped through high school and puberty and literary critics (such as the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik who insisted as recently as 2010 that Catcher is a ""perfect"" twentieth-century novel).One premise of The Catcher in the Rye and Philosophy is that the ease and sincerity with which readers identify with Holden Caulfield rests on Salinger’s attention to the nuances and qualities of experience in the modern world. Coupled with Salinger’s deft subjective, first-person style, Holden comes to seem more real than any fictional character should. This and other paradoxes raised by the novel are treated by authors who find answers in philosophy, particularly in twentieth-century phenomenology and existentialism--areas of philosophy that share Salinger’s attention to lived, as opposed to theorized, experience. Holden’s preoccupation with “phonies,” along with his constant striving to interpret and judge the motives and beliefs of those around him, also taps into contemporary interest in philosophical theories of justice and Harry Frankfurt’s recently celebrated analysis of ""bullshit.""Per Salinger’s request, Catcher has never been made into a movie. One measure of the devotion and fanatical interest Catcher continues to inspire, however, is speculation in blogs and magazines about whether movie rights may become available in the wake of Salinger’s death in 2010. These articles remain purely hypothetical, but the questions they inspire--Who would direct? And, especially, Who would star as Holden Caulfield?--are as vivid and real as Holden himself.",Popular Culture and Philosophy #71,,,October 9th 2012,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",,9780812698008,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344743080l/13590683.jpg,3.54,[],27.0,1.0,,13590683-the-catcher-in-the-rye-and-philosophy,,,,,80.0,35.0,288,,Open Court,"['7', '13', '8', '6', '1']",,,[],,
Keith Ellison,My Country 'Tis of Thee,,English,,"The first Muslim to be elected to Congress speaks out about what divides Americans—and what can bring us together. As a former Catholic who converted to Islam, Keith Ellison, is the first Muslim elected to Congress—from a district with fewer than 1 percent Muslims and 11 percent Blacks. With his unique perspective on uniting a disparate community and speaking to a common goal, Ellison takes a provocative look at America and what needs to change to accommodate different races and beliefs.Filled with anecdotes, statistics, and social commentary, Ellison touches on everything from the Tea Party to Obama, from race to the immigration debate and more. He also draws some very clear distinctions between parties and shows why the deep polarization is unhealthy for America. Deeply patriotic, with My Country ’Tis of Thee, Ellison strives to help define what it means to be an American today.",,,,September 24th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'American', 'Race']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356328207l/13260207.jpg,3.82,[],300.0,3.0,,13260207-my-country-tis-of-thee,,,,,87.0,101.0,304,,Gallery Books/Karen Hunter Publishing,"['35', '33', '20', '6', '7']",,,[],,
Keith Ferrazzi,"Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time",,English,,"Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. In ""Never Eat Alone,"" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him. The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with ""networking."" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: Don't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too. ""Ping"" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- ""invisibility"" is a fate worse than failure. In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a ""conference commando,"" and more, ""Never Eat Alone"" is destined to take its place alongside ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" as an inspirational classic.",,,10/30/05,February 22nd 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership', 'Psychology', 'Relationships', 'Communication', 'Buisness', 'Management']",,9780385512053,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320417949l/84699.jpg,3.86,[],97.0,1.0,,84699.Never_Eat_Alone,,,,,89.0,41202.0,309,,Crown Business,"['14025', '13073', '9744', '3066', '1294']",,,[],,

"Keith Hale, Rupert Brooke, Henry James (contributor)",Collected Poems and Letters from America with Photographs and a new Introduction,,English,,"Rupert Brooke was a man of his time, just not the man that Winston Churchill and the early Brooke Trustees made him out to be. He was delivered a serious disservice by being labeled a ""war poet,"" and was dealt further injustice when critics dismissed his poetry as detached from his life experience. This volume begins with a new introduction by Keith Hale tying Brooke's early poems to his Rugby romantic friendships and discussing Brooke's sexuality in some detail. The Collected Poems and Letters from America are then presented in their entirety together with the original introduction to the letters by Henry James. When Rupert Brooke died of blood poisoning on his way to fight the Turkish forces at Gallipoli in 1915, his friends in England were quick to turn him into a national hero--a patriotic symbol of the many young men of England going to war. That Brooke had recently published five sonnets glorifying patriotic sacrifice did much to promote his legend. That his friends included Winston Churchill, Anthony Asquith, and General Ian Hamilton did even more. To maintain the patriotic legend after the war, Brook’s biography was altered beyond recognition.

"Keith Lowe, Ιωάννης Χαλαζιάς (Translator)",Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II,,English,,"The Second World War might have officially ended in May 1945, but in reality it rumbled on for another ten years...The end of the Second World War in Europe is one of the twentieth century’s most iconic moments.  It is fondly remembered as a time when cheering crowds filled the streets, danced, drank and made love until the small hours.  These images of victory and celebration are so strong in our minds that the period of anarchy and civil war that followed has been forgotten.  Across Europe, landscapes had been ravaged, entire cities razed and more than thirty million people had been killed in the war. The institutions that we now take for granted - such as the police, the media, transport, local and national government - were either entirely absent or hopelessly compromised. Crime rates were soaring, economies collapsing, and the European population was hovering on the brink of starvation.  In Savage Continent, Keith Lowe describes a continent still racked by violence, where large sections of the population had yet to accept that the war was over.  Individuals, communities and sometimes whole nations sought vengeance for the wrongs that had been done to them during the war. Germans and collaborators everywhere were rounded up, tormented and summarily executed.  Concentration camps were reopened and filled with new victims who were tortured and starved.  Violent anti-Semitism was reborn, sparking murders and new pogroms across Europe.  Massacres were an integral part of the chaos and in some places – particularly Greece, Yugoslavia and Poland, as well as parts of Italy and France – they led to brutal civil wars. In some of the greatest acts of ethnic cleansing the world has ever seen, tens of millions were expelled from their ancestral homelands, often with the implicit blessing of the Allied authorities.Savage Continent is the story of post WWII Europe, in all its ugly detail, from the end of the war right up until the establishment of an uneasy stability across Europe towards the end of the 1940s.  Based principally on primary sources from a dozen countries, Savage Continent is a frightening and thrilling chronicle of a world gone mad, the standard history of post WWII Europe for years to come.",,,,July 3rd 2012,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'European History', 'Politics', 'World History', 'Germany', 'Military Fiction', 'Holocaust']",,9781250000200,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344317287l/13167112.jpg,4.2,"['European Book Prize Nominee for Non-fiction (2013)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize (2013)']",93.0,1.0,,13167112-savage-continent,,,,,96.0,3254.0,480,,St. Martin's Press,"['1361', '1319', '453', '91', '30']",,,[],,

Keith T. Jenkins (Goodreads Author),Misfit Toymakers: Misfits Made,,,,"Misfit Toymakers is a Historical Fiction set in the future, back dropped by the secession of Texas from the Union and the states that follow with it, the politics of the fifty years between now and then. It is the story of an intrigue of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of his Loves, as Joshua Danz discovers, then navigates the waters of international commerce to make a place in the world, looking for a life where terrorists, politicians, millionaires, and thugs aren't trying to kill him. Through it all there is the story of love, leadership, personal responsibility and redemption. Joshua Danz, a man conflicted by who he was, is, and is not. He discovers that his is a life of wealth and power that must be learned, not earned. He is the master of a massive, global Enterprise, and yet somehow he is its subject. Also, he is a man of strong desires and dedications; his love, though quiet and covert, is powerful as it drives him to find all truth about himself. As a man with no memories, he discovers that he has been told the story of his life, but then his memories begin to reappear, like a favorite movie, with an additional lifetime attached. All is a jumble as he learns, for certain, who he is and what has happened. He discovers his past, the parts played by others and their intentions. He begins to plot a way out, but not without those he holds dear. He is among the most wealthy, nearly unknown men in the world, torn between women, kingdoms, and lives. Ethyl, the woman he first comes to love, after his recovery is a real piece of work. She is smart, capable, beautiful, sexy, deadly, and wise. She works for him, as his administrative assistant and much more. She makes certain that his every command is carried out, and she protects him with her life - a life that is not nearly as long as it looks. Joshua will avenge somehow, if he can only overcome the truth he discovers about her. Doctor Ilyssa Marquez - Doc - was born in Mexico and is a genuine genius and medical doctor who had her Bachelors at sixteen, Masters at eighteen and before she was thirty had perfected the hardware and surgeries that would rebuild Joshua, almost from scratch.

Keith Taylor (Goodreads Author),This is the Way the World Ends: An Oral History of the Zombie War,,English,,"This is an alternate cover edition of ASINB074JXHFYK.February, 2031: The global population now stands at an estimated 400 million, and every survivor bears the scars of humanity's struggle to defeat an enemy few believed could exist. Some nations have emerged stronger than ever. Others still struggle to survive. Some no longer exist at all.In the aftermath of the zombie pandemic Keith Taylor, noted author of post apocalyptic fiction, traveled the world to gather the first hand accounts of survivors from every walk of life, culture and strata of society, ranging from American political leaders to British journalists to members of India's homeless underclass.These chilling interviews describe the course of humanity's most brutal war, leading from the initial emergence of the virus in the Siberian wilderness to the visceral, heart-rending Shibuya footage, through the confusion of the US President's impeachment to the unintended and disastrous consequences of the UN's sweeping refugee amendment, and ending with us battered and broken, diminished but not defeated, in the fragile peace we now enjoy. Together these accounts represent the most illuminating and complete commentary to date of humanity's loss.From these candid interviews emerges an image of early 21st century civilization as it truly was: imperfect, fragmented and wholly unprepared for a disaster on such a scale. This is the Way the World Ends takes an unflinching, uncompromising look at the world we had and lost; a look at the pain we suffered due to our inability to accept a single, simple truth:Zombies are real.Note: Readers who lived through the pandemic may find the interviews contained within this collection distressing.

It was a smash success, becoming a bestseller and winning widespread acclaim for both the novel and the classic film adaptation. In this 1975 sequel, Billy is thirty-three but still hasn't grown out of his propensity for lying. Stuck in a loveless marriage in a dismal town, where he has a dead-end job in local government, Billy seeks escape through his affair with Helen, who is also unhappily married. But once again he finds himself in danger of being undone by his lies: vodka martinis charged to his expense account, a wise-cracking alter ego named Oscar, a false police report about a stolen set of nonexistent golf clubs, an imaginary cat named 'Mr Pussy-paws' . . . Now the all-important town festival is approaching, but instead of doing the planning, Billy is busy trying to keep ahead of the suspicions of his wife, the police, and Helen's jealous husband.

Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.In the groundbreaking tradition of Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.",,,,December 29th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Science', 'Productivity', 'Audiobook', 'Business', 'Health', 'Neuroscience']",,9781583334386,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436737104l/10865206._SY475_.jpg,4.15,[],99.0,1.0,,10865206-the-willpower-instinct,,,,,94.0,26463.0,275,,Avery,"['11417', '9503', '4083', '932', '528']",,,[],,

She's never walked its hedge maze nor found its secret chambers; she's never glimpsed the shades that haunt it, nor hunted for lost diamonds in its walls. But all of that is about to change. After her grandmother passes away, Sarah and her friend Jackson decide to search for the diamonds--and the house comes alive.

It’s been almost a year since eighteen-year-old Ella Rodriguez was in a car accident that left her crippled, scarred, and without a mother. After a very difficult recovery, she’s been uprooted across the country and forced into the custody of a father that abandoned her when she was a young child. If Ella wants to escape her father’s home and her awful new stepfamily, she must convince her doctors that she’s capable, both physically and emotionally, of living on her own. The problem is, she’s not ready yet. The only way she can think of to start healing is by reconnecting with the one person left in the world who’s ever meant anything to her—her anonymous Internet best friend, Cinder. … Hollywood sensation Brian Oliver has a reputation for being trouble. There’s major buzz around his performance in his upcoming film The Druid Prince, but his management team says he won’t make the transition from teen heartthrob to serious A-list actor unless he can prove he’s left his wild days behind and become a mature adult.

Kelly Oram (Goodreads Author),A is for Abstinence,,,,"""It may have been four years, Kyle, but that doesn’t mean I don’t remember how you operate.""  I snatched her hand as she reached to open the door to the studio. I wasn’t ready to end this moment alone with her. ""You don’t think I’ve learned a few things since then?""  She smirked and shook her head. ""New tricks. Same dog.""  It was impossible not to take her words as a challenge. I pushed her back until she was pinned against the door and leaned in close enough that our breaths mingled. Her eyes snapped wide the same way they always had whenever I’d invaded her personal space, and I watched, satisfied, as she sucked in a lung full of air and held it.  ""That mentality will be your downfall this time around, Val."" I leaned in, letting my lips linger at her jawline for a moment too long before bringing them to her ear. ""Same old tricks,"" I whispered. ""New man.""  With that, I kissed her cheek and breezed past her into the studio, leaving her flustered and in need of another moment to collect herself all over again.  …  Best selling YA romance author Kelly Oram takes her first dive into new adult romance with this heartfelt and hilarious tale of a rockstar and a virgin.  Rockstar to the core, Six-time Grammy Award-winning musician Kyle Hamilton has it all—money, fame, talent, good looks, and a job he loves. His only regret in life: walking away from a certain notorious virgin because he was too prideful, stubborn, and even afraid to give her the only thing she asked of him—his abstinence.  Four years and a broken heart later, Kyle realizes that sex isn’t everything, and he suddenly can’t stop thinking about the girl that got away. Virgin Val Jensen got under his skin like no one else ever has. He wasn’t ready for her then, but things are different now. He’s grown up, he’s learned a few things, and he’s finally figured out exactly what he wants, or, rather, who he wants.  Kyle Hamilton wants a do-over, and this time he’s willing to do—or not do—whatever it takes.  Note from the author: A is for Abstinence is the second and final installment in the V is for Virgin series. While V is for Virgin was a young adult book, A is for Abstinence is a new adult romance and was intended for a more mature audience. Not only is this story told from the perspective of a notorious bad boy, the characters have grown from the first book and are older now. The book was written with a more mature audience in mind. It's still PG-13 (I don't write graphic sex scenes) but it's not as clean as my YA romance. Please keep that in mind if you're a sensitive reader or thinking about passing it to your teenage daughters.

Kelly Rimmer (Goodreads Author),The Things We Cannot Say,,English,,"In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It’s a decision that will alter her destiny…and it’s a lie that will remain buried until the next century.Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina’s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate. Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents’ farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief. Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative that weaves together two women’s stories into a tapestry of perseverance, loyalty, love and honor. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.",,First,02/26/19,October 17th 2019,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Holocaust', 'Adult Fiction']",,9781525831515,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1532268231l/40899464.jpg,4.51,[],92.0,1.0,,40899464-the-things-we-cannot-say,,,,,98.0,44326.0,448,,Graydon House,"['27197', '13489', '2963', '462', '215']",,,[],,

Jack doesn't like the odds of finding the woman, but counts himself lucky that the task is at least on the right side of the law.Until he spends a few days spinning his wheels and is dragged in front of Cassell for a quick reminder of his priorites. Bill's goons do a little spinning of their own, playing a game of Russian roulette a little too close to the back of Jack's head.

A senior agent in the ranks of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) responsible for sabotage, Flick has survived to become one of Britain’s most effective operatives in Northern France. She knows that the Germans’ ability to thwart the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe.But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on assault that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down.

Ken Follett takes us deep into the treacherous world of powerful monarchs, intrigue, murder, and treason with his magnificent epic, A Column of Fire—the chronological latest in the Kingsbridge series, following The Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, and the prequel, The Evening and the Morning.In 1558, the ancient stones of Kingsbridge Cathedral look down on a city torn apart by religious conflict. As power in England shifts precariously between Catholics and Protestants, royalty and commoners clash, testing friendship, loyalty, and love.  Ned Willard wants nothing more than to marry Margery Fitzgerald. But when the lovers find themselves on opposing sides of the religious conflict dividing the country, Ned goes to work for Princess Elizabeth. When she becomes queen, all Europe turns against England. The shrewd, determined young monarch sets up the country’s first secret service to give her early warning of assassination plots, rebellions, and invasion plans. Over a turbulent half century, the love between Ned and Margery seems doomed as extremism sparks violence from Edinburgh to Geneva. Elizabeth clings to her throne and her principles, protected by a small, dedicated group of resourceful spies and courageous secret agents. The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions.

Ken Follett (Goodreads Author),The Pillars of the Earth,,English,,"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition",Kingsbridge #1,,10/28/89,02/04/02,"['Thomas Becket', 'Henry II of England', 'Tom Builder', 'Prior Philip', 'Aliena', 'Jack Jackson', 'Stephen of England', 'Empress Matilda', 'William Hamleigh', 'Ellen', 'Richard of Kingsbridge', 'Alfred Builder', 'Waleran Bigod', 'Lord Percy Hamleigh', 'Lady Regan Hamleigh', 'Remigius']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Adult']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043.jpg,4.31,[],392260.0,4221.0,,5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth,,,,,95.0,648793.0,976,,NAL Trade,"['354788', '189091', '71541', '21183', '12190']",,,['England'],,

"Ken Follett (Goodreads Author), John Lee (Narrator)",Edge of Eternity,,English,,"
  Edge of Eternity is the sweeping, passionate conclusion to Ken Follett’s extraordinary historical epic, The Century Trilogy.
 Throughout these books, Follett has followed the fortunes of five intertwined families – American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh – as they make their way through the twentieth century. Now they come to one of the most tumultuous eras of all: the enormous social, political, and economic turmoil of the 1960s through the 1980s, from civil rights, assassinations, mass political movements and Vietnam to the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, presidential impeachment, revolution – and rock and roll.East German teacher Rebecca Hoffman discovers she’s been spied on by the Stasi for years and commits an impulsive act that will affect her family for the rest of their lives.…George Jakes, the child of a mixed-race couple, bypasses a corporate law career to join Robert F. Kennedy’s Justice Department, and finds himself in the middle not only of the seminal events of the civil rights battle, but a much more personal battle of his own.…Cameron Dewar, the grandson of a senator, jumps at the chance to do some official and unofficial espionage for a cause he believes in, only to discover that the world is a much more dangerous place than he’d imagined.…Dimka Dvorkin, a young aide to Nikita Khrushchev, becomes a prime agent both for good and for ill as the United States and the Soviet Union race to the brink of nuclear war, while his twin sister, Tania, carves out a role that will take her from Moscow to Cuba to Prague to Warsaw – and into history.As always with Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion. With the hand of a master, he brings us into a world we thought we knew but now will never seem the same again.",The Century Trilogy #3,Unabridged,,September 16th 2014,[],Audible Audio,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'War', 'Adult', '20th Century', 'Politics', 'Drama']",,B00M7RNO1Q,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410293676l/23190986.jpg,4.12,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2014)'],621.0,7.0,,23190986-edge-of-eternity,,,,,94.0,80966.0,,,Penguin Audio,"['35008', '27275', '13782', '3558', '1343']",,,"['Berlin (Germany)', 'Moscow (Russian Federation)', 'Washington, D.C.

Men are hungry for authenticity and for sound and bold biblical teaching on true masculinity.

Ken Kocienda (Goodreads Author),Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,,,,"
  An insider's account of Apple's creative process during the golden years of Steve Jobs.
Hundreds of millions of people use Apple products every day; several thousand work on Apple's campus in Cupertino, California; but only a handful sit at the drawing board. Creative Selection recounts the life of one of the few who worked behind the scenes, a highly-respected software engineer who worked in the final years of the Steve Jobs era—the Golden Age of Apple. Ken Kocienda offers an inside look at Apple’s creative process. For fifteen years, he was on the ground floor of the company as a specialist, directly responsible for experimenting with novel user interface concepts and writing powerful, easy-to-use software for products including the iPhone, the iPad, and the Safari web browser. His stories explain the symbiotic relationship between software and product development for those who have never dreamed of programming a computer, and reveal what it was like to work on the cutting edge of technology at one of the world's most admired companies.Kocienda shares moments of struggle and success, crisis and collaboration, illuminating each with lessons learned over his Apple career. He introduces the essential elements of innovation—inspiration, collaboration, craft, diligence, decisiveness, taste, and empathy—and uses these as a lens through which to understand productive work culture.An insider's tale of creativity and innovation at Apple, Creative Selection shows readers how a small group of people developed an evolutionary design model, and how they used this methodology to make groundbreaking and intuitive software which countless millions use every day.",,,,September 4th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,"['Business', 'Design', 'Nonfiction', 'Technology', 'Apple', 'Leadership', 'Programming', 'Audiobook', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering']",,9781250194466,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528578682l/40501533._SX318_.jpg,4.04,[],89.0,1.0,,40501533-creative-selection,,,,,96.0,2937.0,304,,St. Martin's Press,"['949', '1282', '599', '85', '22']",,,[],,

When people arrive at the element, they feel most themselves and most inspired and achieve at their highest levels. ""The Element"" draws on the stories of a wide range of people, from ex-Beatle Paul McCartney to Matt Groening, creator of ""The Simpsons""; from Meg Ryan to Gillian Lynne, who choreographed the Broadway productions of ""Cats"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera""; and from writer Arianna Huffington to renowned physicist Richard Feynman and others, including business leaders and athletes. It explores the components of this new paradigm: The diversity of intelligence, the power of imagination and creativity, and the importance of commitment to our own capabilities.  With a wry sense of humor, Ken Robinson looks at the conditions that enable us to find ourselves in the element and those that stifle that possibility. He shows that age and occupation are no barrier, and that once we have found our path we can help others to do so as well.

Ken Wilber,"The Religion of Tomorrow: A Vision for the Future of the Great Traditions-More Inclusive, More Comprehensive, More Complete-with Integral Buddhism as an Example",,,,"A provocative examination of how the great religious traditions can remain relevant in modern times by incorporating scientific truths learned about human nature over the last century. A single purpose lies at the heart of all the great religious traditions: awakening to the astonishing reality of the true nature of ourselves and the universe. At the same time, through centuries of cultural accretion and focus on myth and ritual as ends in themselves, this core insight has become obscured. Here Ken Wilber provides a path for reenvisioning a religion of the future that acknowledges the evolution of humanity in every realm while remaining faithful to that original spiritual vision. For the traditions to attract modern men and women, Wilber asserts, they must incorporate the extraordinary number of scientific truths learned about human nature in just the past hundred years--for example, about the mind and brain, emotions, and the growth of consciousness--that the ancients were simply unaware of and thus were unable to include in their meditative systems. Taking Buddhism as an example, Wilber demonstrates how his comprehensive Integral Approach--which is already being applied to several world religions by some of their adherents--can avert a -cultural disaster of unparalleled proportions- the utter neglect of the glorious upper reaches of human potential by the materialistic postmodern worldview. Moreover, he shows how we can apply this approach to our own spiritual practice.

"Kendall H. Brown (Joint Author), Sharon A. Minichiello, Sharon Minichiello","Taisho Chic: Japanese Modernity, Nostalgia, and Deco",,English,,"The Taisho period, loosely the first three decades of the twentieth century, was a dynamic era in Japan. On one hand, it spawned social liberalism and political radicalism; on the other, it generated the social conservatism and cultural nativism that grew into the ultra-nationalism of 1937-1945.In art, it produced an infatuation with Western modernism as well as a new exploration of traditional aesthetics. Between these dramatic polarities was a rich middle ground of cultural synthesis and symbiosis in which Western concepts of modernity and nostalgia for Japanese tradition seamlessly merged or creatively contrasted. These values are witnessed in the Art Deco style, particularly as it infused Japanese art of Taisho.Much of the debate over Japanese cultural identity centered on the appearance and social role of women. The primary focus in this volume is the nexus of tradition and modernity manifest in popular images of women, as well as in domestic furnishings and fashions made for women.In an introductory essay, historian Sharon Minichiello provides a broad context for these issues by sketching major domestic and international events and themes of the period. In his essay and catalogue entries, art historian Kendall Brown first examines how women were at the center of the sociocultural debate on Japanese modernity, then details how artists helped fashion various female types, including the modern girl, the traditional beauty, and a new type of hybrid woman.The nihonga paintings, woodblock prints, textiles, and domestic artifacts discussed and illustrated here are a broad range of objects representative of mainstream Taisho visual culture, and reconstruct the styles popular from 1915 to 1935 in a celebration of Taisho- Chic.",,,07/30/02,May 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Japan', 'History', 'Art', 'Fashion']",,9780937426524,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1174580330l/418740.jpg,4.27,[],98.0,1.0,,418740.Taisho_Chic,,,,,100.0,15.0,176,,Honolulu Academy of Arts,"['7', '5', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

When he was broke he would pick fruit or do odd jobs to earn the fifty dollars or so that would last him for weeks. His goal was to set a record - most North American species seen in a year - but along the way he began to realize that at this breakneck pace he was only looking, not seeing. What had been a game became a quest for a deeper understanding of the natural world. Kingbird Highway is a unique coming-of-age story, combining a lyrical celebration of nature with wild, and sometimes dangerous, adventures, starring a colorful cast of characters.",,,10/30/97,April 11th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Birds', 'Nonfiction', 'Nature', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Science', 'Animals', 'Natural History', 'Adventure']",,9780618709403,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349015381l/543888.jpg,4.24,['National Outdoor Book Award for Classic (2017)'],98.0,1.0,,543888.Kingbird_Highway,,,,,97.0,1772.0,320,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['789', '677', '257', '37', '12']",,,[],,
Kenn Kaufman,A Season on the Wind: Inside the World of Spring Migration,,,,"A close look at one season in one key site that reveals the amazing science and magic of spring bird migration, and the perils of human encroachment.   Every spring, billions of birds sweep north, driven by ancient instincts to return to their breeding grounds. This vast parade often goes unnoticed, except in a few places where these small travelers concentrate in large numbers. One such place is along Lake Erie in northwestern Ohio. There, the peak of spring migration is so spectacular that it attracts bird watchers from around the globe, culminating in one of the world’s biggest birding festivals.     Millions of winged migrants pass through the region, some traveling thousands of miles, performing epic feats of endurance and navigating with stunning accuracy. Now climate change threatens to disrupt patterns of migration and the delicate balance between birds, seasons, and habitats. But wind farms—popular as green energy sources—can be disastrous for birds if built in the wrong places. This is a fascinating and urgent study of the complex issues that affect bird migration.",,,,April 2nd 2019,[],Hardcover,"['Birds', 'Nature', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Natural History', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Biology', 'Science Nature', 'Ecology']",,9781328566423,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1535688394l/40796092._SY475_.jpg,4.08,[],17.0,1.0,,40796092-a-season-on-the-wind,,,,,96.0,259.0,288,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['94', '105', '50', '7', '3']",,,[],,
Kennedy Fox (Goodreads Author),Baby Mine,,English,,"I saw her first.Blonde. Gorgeous. Feisty.I was smitten.But it didn’t matter because she chose him and he was my best friend and roommate. I’d never be able to compete with that, so I pushed her away instead. It was easy when she lived hours away, and I didn’t have to see her every day, but then she moved in with us. Now, I’m screwed.To her singing in the shower every morning, dancing in the kitchen while she makes coffee, and doing yoga in our living room, I can’t stop thinking about her in all the wrong ways. She’s not mine and never will be, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting to push her against a wall and claim her mouth.She’s constantly on me for making messes, bringing chicks home every weekend, and being a smartass when their PDA gets on my nerves. Considering neither of them know how I feel, it’s not fair for the way I act toward them. I should move out so I can get over her for good; however, the selfish part of me can’t let go. And then the unthinkable happens... When my best friend dies in a motorcycle accident, the two of us are left to grieve our loss together. Instead of pushing her away, I pull her closer.

Kenneth A. Kitchen,On the Reliability of the Old Testament,,English,,"For more than two hundred years controversy has raged over the reliability of the Old Testament. Questions about the factuality of its colorful stories of heroes, villains, and kings, for example, have led many critics to see the entire Hebrew Bible as little more than pious fiction. In this fascinating book, noted ancient historian K. A. Kitchen takes strong issue with today's ""revisionist"" critics and offers a firm foundation for the historicity of the biblical texts. In a detailed, comprehensive, and entertaining manner, Kitchen draws on an unprecedented range of historical data from the ancient Near East -- the Bible's own world -- and uses it to soundly reassess both the biblical record and the critics who condemn it. Working back from the latest periods (for which hard evidence is readily available) to the remotest times, Kitchen systematically shows up the many failures of favored arguments against the Bible and marshals pertinent permanent evidence from antiquity's inscriptions and artifacts to demonstrate the basic honesty of the Old Testament writers.  Enhanced with numerous tables, figures, and maps, On the Reliability of the Old Testament is a must-read for anyone interested in the question of biblical truth.",,,11/06/03,June 9th 2006,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Theology', 'Old Testament', 'Religion', 'Christian', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'Archaeology', 'Nonfiction']",,9780802803962,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348082957l/165002.jpg,4.32,[],71.0,1.0,,165002.On_the_Reliability_of_the_Old_Testament,,,,,96.0,166.0,684,,Eerdmans,"['88', '52', '19', '5', '2']",,,[],,

Kenneth Crutchfield (Goodreads Author),The 'Great' Kickin'dog,,English,,"Ex musician, assembly line worker and alcoholic, John Coleman Sr. is a man with deferred and shattered dreams. Living in a Chicago housing project during the 60’s he is a father raising his eight-member family; four girls, two musical prodigy boys and a mentally unstable wife, in a drug, gang and gun infested environment among households with absent dads. During a competitive time of young musical prodigies, he fights for a pathway out of the projects through his talented sons. On a quest to find a way out, he drags his gifted boys on a whirlwind journey of hope, from talent shows to south side Blues clubs and observes their reputation growing with each performance. But along with the journey to see his boys “get great”, is his ongoing struggle with alcohol, his wife’s neurotic behavior and the fortified barrier of resentment from his jealous daughters all brought on by a family history of mental illness. Not only does John Coleman Sr. have to contend with the inner turmoil of his family, but a family tragedy shakes him to the core and threatens the sanctity of his high-spirited loved ones.The 'Great' Kickin'dog is a Black experience during a turbulent time of civil rights in the 6o's and free spirits of the 70's embedded in the cradle of Chicago's segregation.

Kenneth D. Wald,Religion and Politics in the United States,,English,,"Religion and Politics in the United States, Sixth Edition, offers a comprehensive account of the role of religious ideas, institutions and communities in American life. This book examines the ways religion can both compel and constrain involvement in politics and policy. What facilitates political participation? What impedes it? What are the limits of religious mobilization and involvement? Are there benefits? Are there dangers? Religion and Politics in the United States addresses these questions by exploring how religion has influenced the structure of American government and law as well as how religious perspectives inform contemporary political issues including topics such as equal rights for women and gays. The book also explores the ways that religion has affected the orientation of partisan politics in the United States. Through a detailed review of the political attitudes and behaviors of major religious and minority faith traditions, the book establishes that religion continues to be a major part of the American cultural and political milieu while explaining that it must interact with many other factors to impact political outcomes in the United States.

It explains what pollination is, who does it, why its essential to us, what things are threatening our pollinators and what we, as individuals, can do about it.They have been in existence for over 100 million years, but it has taken us less than 30 years to kill almost all of them off. Honey bees are responsible for pollinating 60% of the world's food supply. Without them, the human race would face starvation. A worldwide epidemic, it has been called the bee apocalypse by Russia's president, but it is worse in the United States than any other country. Since 1972, feral honey bees in the United States have declined 80% to near extinction, and domestic bees in the United States are down to 60%. Since 2006, the epidemic has been referred to as colony collapse disorder, describing the disappearance of entire colonies of bees.Among the causes cited for this disaster of epidemic proportions are parasites, the decrease in abundance and diversity of wildflowers, insecticides and genetically engineered foods (GMO's) that create their own synthetic pesticides which kill bees as well as other insects. But one thing is for certain-- mankind is responsible for the drastic decline in bee population and the United States government is doing nothing about it. On the contrary, the government has taken measures to make the problem worse.There is more to this delicate 100 million year old evolution of pollination that just honey bees, who were not native to the United States, but imported from Europe and probably originally came from Africa. At least 4,000 species of wild bees are known to exist in North America alone. All of them are at risk, and this book will show you how you can make a difference in saving them, our food supply, and our planet as we know it.50% of the royalties of this book will be donated to Bee Bay, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of bees and the environment.",,,,September 2nd 2013,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B00EYOG02A,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384959332l/18871297.jpg,4.22,[],98.0,1.0,,18871297-bless-the-bees,,,,,93.0,41.0,119,,Amazon Digital Services,"['21', '11', '6', '3', '0']",,,[],,

In it, you will find clear, simple examples to help demonstrate common concerns and solutions in a range of areas, including communication, relationships, employment, substance use, and culture.

Pilot-in-training Matt Cruse and Kate de Vries, expert on high-altitude life-forms, are invited aboard the Starclimber, a vessel that literally climbs its way into the cosmos. Before they even set foot aboard the ship, catastrophe strikes:Kate announces she is engaged—and not to Matt.Despite this bombshell, Matt and Kate embark on their journey into space, but soon the ship is surrounded by strange and unsettling life-forms, and the crew is forced to combat devastating mechanical failure. For Matt, Kate, and the entire crew of the Starclimber, what began as an exciting race to the stars has now turned into a battle to save their lives.Award-winning and bestselling author Kenneth Oppel brings us back to a rich world of flight and fantasy in this breathtaking new sequel to Airborn and Skybreaker.",Matt Cruse #3,,,August 26th 2008,"['Kate de Vries', 'Matt Cruse']",Hardcover,"['Steampunk', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Teen', 'Canada', 'Historical Fiction']",,9780002007450,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328209895l/3407703.jpg,4.22,['CLA Book of the Year for Children Award Nominee (2009)'],187.0,2.0,,3407703-starclimber,,,,,96.0,8092.0,490,,HarperCollins Canada,"['3711', '2799', '1267', '246', '69']",,,[],,
Kenneth Oppel (Goodreads Author),Sunwing,,English,,"Kenneth Oppel gives a bat's-eye view of the horrors of animal testing in Sunwing, the sequel to his popular and award-winning novel for middle readers, Silverwing. Shade, the lost baby bat of the first book, has rejoined his colony only to lose his freedom as the bats plunge into a mysterious human building they believe is paradise. The building's vast interior forest, with its teeming insects and eerie absence of owls, certainly seems like Eden. But Shade and his Brightwing friend Marina, now young adults, discover that the humans have a sinister motive for befriending the bats--they are using them as unwitting suicide bombers over a jungle war zone.  In addition, the bats are threatened once again by Goth, the giant jungle bat with the cannibalistic tastes and irrepressible knack for survival of Hannibal Lecter. This time he has a plan for making his god, Zotz, supreme: to be explicit (and Oppel is), by ripping out the hearts of 100 imprisoned bats, owls, and rats. Shade's and Marina's race to save their companions from this two-pronged threat makes for exciting and occasionally terrifying reading.        Once again Oppel immerses readers in the world view of his tiny flying mammals. It becomes second nature to see things upside down, hide in crevices, squint at the brightness of the sun, and sense danger through sound vibrations. Particularly chilling is his portrayal of the humans' laboratory, with its concentration-camp-like indifference to life. In Sunwing, Oppel offers breathless suspense while eliciting our compassion for these misunderstood creatures of the night.

She is charged with murder. The clues: a sack of chicken feed slit with a knife, a milky-eyed dog tied outdoors one cold afternoon. The motives: the brutal business of farming and a family code of ethics as unforgiving as the winter prairie itself.In his critically acclaimed first novel, Kent Haruf delivers the sweeping tale of a woman of the American High Plains, as told by her neighbor, Sanders Roscoe. As Roscoe shares what he knows, Edith's tragedies unfold: a childhood of pre-dawn chores, a mother's death, a violence that leaves a father dependent on his children, forever enraged. Here is the story of a woman who sacrifices her happiness in the name of family--and then, in one gesture, reclaims her freedom.

They say some people are born with decreased activity in the front central lobe causing them a deficiency in empathy.

Vaun is constantly breaking my nevers and, at the rate we are going, I won’t have any left before I die.And that one thought is the cold bucket of water I need and hate because I want to keep kissing this boy until he’s had enough of me. But I’m dying. While I’m kissing him, I’m dying. While I’m thinking about dying, I’m dying and that just isn’t fair on a boy who has already faced that kind of loss. I pull my mouth from his and sit on the edge of my bed with my hand over my mouth.“Blue, don’t.” He squats on his knees in front of me, his hands on my hips and he’s looking at me with sad, brown eyes. I shake my head. I don’t want to see him. “Don’t deny us this. Whatever it is that you’re not ready to tell me, we’ll work through it with time. Just let us get through tonight and take each day at a time.”But we don’t have the luxury of time. We have the ticking of a clock and an undeniable need for each other that’s so unfathomable and so unfair. I close my eyes, unable to look at him anymore. It hurts too much and I feel the waver.“Harper, I have been carrying such a heavy load of life, I need this. I promise you that if there comes a time where you feel we can’t do this, then I will give it to you. No fight, no pleading. I will give you up if you want, but right now, give us tonight and we can take it one night at a time, one day, one hour, one minute … every second.”",Albany Boys #1,,08/13/13,,[],,"['New Adult', 'Romance', 'High School', 'Young Adult']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364340827l/17696042.jpg,4.04,[],76.0,1.0,,17696042-never-goodbye,,,,,90.0,262.0,,,,"['114', '76', '47', '18', '7']",,,"['Albany, Missouri (United States)']",,

Kerry Cohen (Goodreads Author),Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promiscuity,,English,,"For everyone who was that girl. For everyone who knew that girl. For everyone who wondered who that girl was.Kerry Cohen is eleven years old when she recognizes the power of her body in the leer of a grown man. Her parents are recently divorced and it doesn't take long before their lassitude and Kerry's desire to stand out--to be memorable in some way--combine to lead her down a path she knows she shouldn't take. Kerry wanted attention. She wanted love. But not really understanding what love was, not really knowing how to get it, she reached for sex instead.Loose Girl is Kerry Cohen's captivating memoir about her descent into promiscuity and how she gradually found her way toward real intimacy. The story of addiction--not just to sex, but to male attention--Loose Girl is also the story of a young girl who came to believe that boys and men could give her life meaning. It didn't matter who he was. It was their movement that mattered, their being together. And for a while, that was enough.From the early rush of exploration to the day she learned to quiet the desperation and allow herself to love and be loved, Kerry's story is never less than riveting. In rich and immediate detail, Loose Girl re-creates what it feels like to be in that desperate moment, when a girl tries to control a boy by handing over her body, when the touch of that boy seems to offer proof of something, but ultimately delivers little more than emptiness.Kerry Cohen's journey from that hopeless place to her current confident and fulfilled existence is a cautionary tale and a revelation for girls young and old. The unforgettable memoir of one young woman who desperately wanted to matter, Loose Girl will speak to countless others with its compassion, understanding, and love.",,,01/01/08,May 1st 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Psychology', 'Sexuality', 'Feminism', 'Mental Health', 'Womens']",,9781401303495,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440734607l/2249920._SY475_.jpg,3.66,[],169.0,2.0,,2249920.Loose_Girl,,,,,87.0,10028.0,210,,Hyperion,"['2447', '3233', '3081', '1013', '254']",,,[],,

    There is a ghost in my house. I've only seen it out of the corner of my eye, but I think it is a cat
  
  , says a little boy in this comforting tale of love and loss.
There's something oddly familiar about this ghost cat--it does lots of things that remind the boy of the cat he used to have. The boy's not sure why the ghost cat never stays for more than a few moments, or why the ghost cat has visited him in the first place. He follows the ghost cat all over his house, until finally it leads him to something new and wonderful.Bestselling author/illustrator Kevan Atteberry's artwork and story strike a perfect balance of evocative and haunting, as well as warm and hugely comforting to anyone struggling to cope with a loss.With a few carefully chosen words and simple, expressive illustrations, Ghost Cat captures both the poignancy of losing a pet and the importance of moving on without erasing or forgetting what came before.Winner of the Crystal Kite Award, Western DivisionA Bank Street Best Book of the YearWashington State Book Award Finalist",,,,June 11th 2019,[],Hardcover,"['Picture Books', 'Cats', 'Animals', 'Ghosts', 'Childrens', 'Death', 'Halloween', 'Fiction', 'Storytime', 'Supernatural']",,9780823442836,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547246958l/42042209._SX318_.jpg,4.06,[],71.0,1.0,,42042209-ghost-cat,,,,,95.0,317.0,32,,Neal Porter Books,"['118', '120', '63', '13', '3']",,,[],,

Kevin Brooks,Lucas,,English,,"Lucas, the dramatic story of a young woman's encounter with the ugly side of humanity and her struggle to defeat it. British novelist Kevin Brooks's masterpiece is set on the island community of Hale over one summer, as 15-year-old Caitlin McCann realizes her small world is changing. Her brother is acting strangely, hanging out with the neighborhood reprobates and getting drunk, and her best friend follows his lead. To make matters worse, the son of an influential local has begun making lewd advances. And Caitlin feels she has no one in whom to confide: Her mother died in a car accident years ago, and her father, though loving and supportive, is a writer who spends much of his time holed up in his study.It's in this confusing context that Caitlin encounters Lucas, a lean, blond, blue-eyed stranger who mysteriously appears on the island. Caitlin feels drawn to him, but the other local kids are not: they call him a gypsy, and even throw rocks at him. Before long, Lucas is accused of a crime he did not commit, and Caitlin finds herself in a moral quandary.Lucas is filled with the kind of pain, love, and anguish that teenage readers adore. And Caitlin's quest to find her place in the world and to determine what's right is a struggle to which every teenager will relate. Why not start your own parent/teen book club with Lucas?

She talks with him, teases him, but reveals nothing about herself except her phone number.

"Kevin Cullen, Shelley Murphy",Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice,,English,,"This unforgettable narrative follows the astonishing career and epic manhunt for Whitey Bulger—a gangster whose life was more sensational than fiction.Raised in a South Boston housing project, James ""Whitey"" Bulger became the most wanted fugitive of his generation. In this riveting story, rich with family ties and intrigue, award-winning Boston Globe reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy follow Whitey's extraordinary criminal career--from teenage thievery to bank robberies to the building of his underworld empire and a string of brutal murders. It was after a nine-year stint in Alcatraz and other prisons that Whitey reunited with his brother William ""Billy"" Bulger, who was soon to become one of Massachusetts's most powerful politicians. He also became reacquainted with John Connolly, who had grown up around the corner from the Bulgers and was now--with Billy's help--a rising star at the FBI.Once Whitey emerged triumphant from the bloody Boston gang wars, Connolly recruited him as an informant against the Mafia. Their clandestine relationship made Whitey untouchable; the FBI overlooked gambling, drugs, and even homicide to protect their source. Among the close-knit Irish community in South Boston, nothing was more important than honor and loyalty, and nothing was worse than being a rat. Whitey is charged with the deaths of nineteen people killed over turf, for business, and even for being informants; yet to this day he denies he ever gave up his friends or landed anyone in jail.Based on exclusive access and previously undisclosed documents, Cullen and Murphy explore the truth of the Whitey Bulger story. They reveal for the first time the extent of his two parallel family lives with different women, as well as his lifelong paranoia stemming in part from his experience in the CIA's MKULTRA program. They describe his support of the IRA and his hitherto-unknown role in the Boston busing crisis, and they show a keen understanding of his mindset while on the lam and behind bars. The result is the first full portrait of this legendary criminal figure--a gripping story of wiseguys and cops, horrendous government malfeasance, and a sixteen-year manhunt that climaxed in Whitey's dramatic capture in Santa Monica in June 2011.",,,,February 11th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Biography', 'Crime', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Unfinished', 'American']",,9780393087727,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358133097l/16241144.jpg,3.96,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)'],83.0,1.0,,16241144-whitey-bulger,,,,,96.0,1814.0,496,,W.

Kevin M. Sullivan,Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders,,English,,"By the time Richard Trenton Chase graduated high school, everyone knew he was strange. But no one had any idea how bizarre he'd become, or what dark impulses were flowing through his troubled brain. The transformation from the outwardly strange young man to the diabolical killer he ultimately became, was gradual and would not become known until it was too late. First it was the killing of small animals and birds, and the drinking of their blood. However, when these sacrifices failed to satiate his needs, Richard Chase would seek out the highest form of life, and the city of Sacramento, California would react in horror to the hideous murders and mutilations committed by his hands. For those living in the quiet neighborhoods where the murders occurred, it was nothing less than a time of terror until the fiend was captured.Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders (with 23 photos), is an in-depth look into the life and disturbed mind of a killer, his family, and his many victims, the living as well as the dead.

Kevin M. Sullivan,Kentucky Bloodbath: Ten Bizarre Tales of Murder from the Bluegrass State,,English,," New From The Author of Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders and The Bundy Murders!  Think Kentucky is all about horses and mint juleps? You may revise that image with this excursion into the weird and the bizarre: from a medieval-esque murder in a small town museum to the jilted boyfriend who decided that his former girlfriend needed to die on her twenty-first birthday. And then there’s the demented son who returns home to live with his mother and stepfather, and one night in their beautiful mansion sitting atop a high bluff overlooking the Ohio River, slaughters them. Each case will keep you on the edge of your seat.  From The Author:As I began my research into past Kentucky killers and their victims, I was well aware there were a good number of very unusual homicides from the Bluegrass State, as I’d read about them over the years in newspapers accounts, heard the strange tales from relatives and friends, or watched the occasional newscasts on TV.  But these sources were never in-depth studies of the cases in question; and worse still, very often, erroneous information came forth, and it wasn’t until I began the research, using the original case files, that I’d find out what really happened. And it would be in these moments of discovery, that an accurate picture of each individual tragedy would rise and take shape from the seemingly innumerable police reports and interviews of those involved.  Indeed, many of these ten stories I’ve “unearthed” would have been lost forever had I not sought them out from the dusty archives and storage facilities scattered throughout the state; stories that would, ultimately, be destined for obscurity and eventual disposal as the decades dragged on.  Recently, one radio interviewer, contemplating their bizarre aspects, quite rightly stated how all of these Kentucky murders resembled something out of The Twilight Zone, and I quickly had to agree with his assessment. That’s the nature of these cases, and frankly, it was what I was looking for in my quest to uncover true crime in Kentucky.  From The Story ""Blood In The Moonlight"": “As Bauer led the officer to the side door where they entered the house through the kitchen, Kendrick asked if he knew who’d done this, and Bauer said, “No.” Just before stepping inside the home, Kendrick radioed the Emergency Medical Services unit, telling them to continue on to this address – code 3 – and that homicide units should be sent as well. Having notified dispatch, Kendrick then drew his weapon and entered a nightmare.""",,,,May 29th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime']",,B00YJDTIT8,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442172624l/25632020._SY475_.jpg,3.68,[],95.0,1.0,,25632020-kentucky-bloodbath,,,,,89.0,175.0,109,,WildBlue Press,"['44', '57', '54', '14', '6']",,,[],,

Kevin Trudeau,Kevin Trudeau's Mega Memory,How to Release Your Superpower Memory in 30 Minutes Or Less a Day,,Self-Help,"Do you think you have a ""bad memory""? Impossible, says Kevin Trudeau, the world's foremost authority on memory improvement training. There are no bad memories, only untrained memories. In order to release our natural memory, Trudeau says, we just need to learn to retrieve what we already know. As founder of the American Memory Institute, Kevin Trudeau has already helped more than one million people do just that. Each Mega Memory lesson in this book takes no more than thirty minutes per day and uses pictures, rather than the laborious word-association techniques of other memory systems, to activate our inborn memory. With this easy-to-follow system, you'll be able to instantly remember names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, speeches, and schoolwork. Even better, Trudeau's system ensures instant recall and long-term Mega Memory. All you need is the desire to unleash your Mega Memory, and you can reap all these incredible rewards! Labeled with a learning disability at an early age, Kevin Trudeau was convinced his problem was an inability to recall information. He read everything he could on memory improvement. Eventually, he developed his own program for memory retrieval and formed the American Memory Institute.

Khaled Hosseini (Goodreads Author),A Thousand Splendid Suns,,English,,"A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years—from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding—that puts the violence, fear, hope, and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives—the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness—are inextricable from the history playing out around them.Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship.

Abdullah and his sister Pari live with their father and stepmother in the small village of Shadbagh. Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their heads touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, with profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways in which we help our loved ones in need, how the choices we make resonate through history and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.",,,02/29/12,May 21st 2013,"['Julien', 'Abdullah', 'Pari', 'Suleiman Wahdati', 'Nila Wahdati', 'Nabi', 'Parwana', 'Saboor', 'Timur Bashiri', 'Idris Bashiri', 'Masooma', 'Eric Lacombe', 'Markos Varvaris', 'Thalia']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Drama']",,9781594631764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358190204l/16115612.jpg,4.05,"['Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for International Book (2014)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction (2013)', 'DSC Prize Nominee for South Asian Literature  for Longlist (2015)']",5848.0,67.0,,16115612-and-the-mountains-echoed,,,,,95.0,301931.0,404,,Riverhead Books,"['107293', '121481', '58470', '11635', '3052']",,,"['Kabul (Afghanistan)', 'California (United States)', 'Paris (France)', 'Tinos (Greece)', 'Afghanistan']",,

The only remaining oases of peace were a scatter of little villages lost in the remote reaches of the frontier. One of these villages was Mano Majra.”It is a place, Khushwant Singh goes on to tell us at the beginning of this classic novel, where Sikhs and Muslims have lived together in peace for hundreds of years. Then one day, at the end of the summer, the “ghost train” arrives, a silent, incredible funeral train loaded with the bodies of thousands of refugees, bringing the village its first taste of the horrors of the civil war. Train to Pakistan is the story of this isolated village that is plunged into the abyss of religious hate.

But Mariamne has a further gift: an illness has left her with visions; she has the power of prophecy. It is her prophesying that drives the two girls to flee to Egypt, where they study philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy in the Great Library of Alexandria.After seven years they return to a Judaea where many now believe John the Baptizer is the messiah. Salome too begins to believe, but Mariamne, now called Magdalene, is drawn to his cousin, Yeshu'a, a man touched by the divine in the same way she was during her days of illness. Together they speak of sharing their direct experience of God; but Yeshu'a unexpectedly gains a reputation as a healer, and as the ill and the troubled flock to him, he and Magdalene are forced to make a terrible decision.This radical retelling of the greatest story ever told brings Mary Magdalene to life—not as a prostitute or demon-possessed—but as an educated woman who was truly the ""apostle to the apostles.""From the Hardcover edition.",,,10/28/05,03/27/07,"['Salome', 'John the Baptizer', 'Yeshu’a', 'Mary Magdalene']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Religion', 'Historical', 'Spirituality', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Biblical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Biblical']",,9780307346667,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175446011l/514811._SY475_.jpg,4.07,[],63985.0,657.0,,514811.The_Secret_Magdalene,,,,,87.0,4260.0,448,,Crown,"['2189', '960', '571', '297', '243']",,,[],,

Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror.

It's because all you ever had was your youth, and you spent that so long ago now it's hard to remember what you bought with it. Mrs. Warner shuddered in her loosening skin, was almost running now. It's because you're scared. Lately you're so scared and so aimless and so useless you sleep half the day and panic half the night. In between, you watch TV to ward off the evil of watching yourself. So—if not death, then what?""When she tripped over a rock—and in tripping, plunged over the edge of a cliff—Mrs. Warner had forgotten the desert, the cacti, the heat, the hunger, the thirst. All that was left was an ever increasing panic and an ever deepening desperation. And then there was the shock of falling and the screaming inside: Here we go, here we go—but don't hurt, don't hurt. Oh god, please! Don't hurt!After that, there was nothing.""Until she woke up at the bottom of an arroyo with a lot of surviving to do. And all she had was her purse. It wasn't much to face a desert with, but Mrs. Warner, born Molly Brock, was in a fight for her life, the life she didn't want until she was just about to lose it.What's an everyday housewife to do? In Molly's case, a lot. And every bit of it changing her from ordinary to extraordinary.",,,11/29/13,December 7th 2013,[],Paperback,"['Survival', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Humor', 'Novels', 'Womens', 'Nature', 'Thriller', 'Action']",,9781937819903,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386953097l/19405702.jpg,4.33,[],7065.0,74.0,,19405702-walks-away-woman,,,,,98.0,996.0,254,,Eio Books,"['413', '523', '41', '13', '6']",,,[],,
"Ki Longfellow (Goodreads Author), Ben Wickey (Goodreads Author) (Contributor)",The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall: A Fairytale of Grimm Art,,English,,"Twenty three years ago Vivian Stanshall died in a fire, trapped in a north London flat. Drunk, he slept through his own death. Vivian was the ineffable, unflappable, elegant and irreverently funny frontman and songwriter for the Bonzo Dog Dada Band, a group of art students who’d created a band unlike any other band one could name - and still adored by thousands long after their short time in the sun was knocked on the head by Vivian himself. ""We were art students. We were Dada. We were making fun of the worst excesses of rock 'n roll. One day I looked around to discover we'd become what we were parodying.""  Written by his wife of 18 years, an artist in her own right, this is a behind-the-scenes, beneath-the-sheets, under the bed tale of an actual genius – few who admired him would disagree. In many ways this is Vivian through his own private words gleaned from his personal journals. It’s also full of up close and revealing portraits of legends: Keith Moon, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jimi Hendrix, George Harrison, Steve Winwood, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, John Peel, Joe Cocker, and so many more. But even more than all that, it’s an ART BOOK: crammed full of Vivian’s paintings, sketches, unpublished family photos, letters and poems.Vivian Stanshall was the last of the true Bohemians. This is also a tale of Dada, a mad sad glad voyage through life on a grand scale made by one of England’s greatest treasures: the genius who was Vivian Stanshall.(As Ki writes: all memory is Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"".

Kiersten White (Goodreads Author),Now I Rise,,English,,"Lada Dracul has no allies. No throne. All she has is what she’s always had: herself. After failing to secure the Wallachian throne, Lada is out to punish anyone who dares to cross her blood-strewn path. Filled with a white-hot rage, she storms the countryside with her men, accompanied by her childhood friend Bogdan, terrorizing the land. But brute force isn’t getting Lada what she wants. And thinking of Mehmed brings little comfort to her thorny heart. There’s no time to wonder whether he still thinks about her, even loves her. She left him before he could leave her. What Lada needs is her younger brother Radu’s subtlety and skill. But Mehmed has sent him to Constantinople—and it’s no diplomatic mission. Mehmed wants control of the city, and Radu has earned an unwanted place as a double-crossing spy behind enemy lines. Radu longs for his sister’s fierce confidence—but for the first time in his life, he rejects her unexpected plea for help. Torn between loyalties to faith, to the Ottomans, and to Mehmed, he knows he owes Lada nothing. If she dies, he could never forgive himself—but if he fails in Constantinople, will Mehmed ever forgive him?

Kiese Laymon (Goodreads Author),Heavy: An American Memoir,,English,,"In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.",,,,October 16th 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'Anti Racist', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'African American', 'Social Justice', 'Essays']",,9781501125652,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517524042l/29430746._SY475_.jpg,4.44,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Christopher Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose (2018)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)']",98.0,1.0,,29430746-heavy,,,,,97.0,24304.0,241,,Scribner,"['14246', '7521', '1763', '462', '312']",,,[],,

"Kim John Payne, Lisa M. Ross (Goodreads Author)","Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids",,English,,"Today’s busier, faster, supersized society is waging an undeclared war . . . on childhood. As the pace of life accelerates to hyperspeed–with too much stuff, too many choices, and too little time–children feel the pressure. They can become anxious, have trouble with friends and school, or even be diagnosed with behavioral problems. Now, in defense of the extraordinary power of less, internationally renowned family consultant Kim John Payne helps parents reclaim for their children the space and freedom that all kids need, allowing their children’s attention to focus and their individuality to flourish.Based on Payne’s twenty year’s experience successfully counseling busy families, Simplicity Parenting teaches parents how to worry and hover less–and how to enjoy more. For those who want to slow their children’s lives down but don’t know where to start, Payne offers both inspiration and a blueprint for change.• Streamline your home environment. The average child has more than 150 toys. Here are tips for reducing the amount of toys, books, and clutter–as well as the lights, sounds, and general sensory overload that crowd the space young imaginations need in order to grow.• Establish rhythms and rituals. Predictability (routines) and transparency (knowing the day’s plan) are soothing pressure valves for children. Here are ways to ease daily tensions, create battle-free mealtimes and bedtimes, and tell if your child is overwhelmed.• Schedule a break in the schedule. Too many activities may limit children’s ability to motivate and direct themselves. Learn how to establish intervals of calm in your child’s daily torrent of constant doing–and familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of organized sports and other “enrichment” activities.• Scale back on media and parental involvement. Back out of hyperparenting by managing your children’s “screen time” to limit the endless and sometimes scary deluge of information and stimulation. Parental hovering is really about anxiety; by doing less and trusting more, parents can create a sanctuary that nurtures children’s identity, well-being, and resiliency as they grow–slowly–into themselves. A manifesto for protecting the grace of childhood, Simplicity Parenting is an eloquent guide to bringing new rhythms to bear on the lifelong art of parenting.",,,,August 25th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Childrens', 'Self Help', 'Education', 'Audiobook', 'Family', 'Psychology', 'Adult', 'Reference']",,9780345507976,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320462716l/6129974.jpg,4.18,[],100.0,1.0,,6129974-simplicity-parenting,,,,,96.0,9095.0,256,,Ballantine Books,"['3886', '3449', '1389', '289', '82']",,,[],,

En het was al niet makkelijk, want Kim heeft dezelfde ziekte waar Ron aan sterft: Cystic Fibrosis, een rotziekte, die je letterlijk de adem beneemt, die je dagelijkse leven overheerst en waar je niet oud mee wordt.In Ademloos vertelt Kim hoe ze vecht tegen onbegrip en onvermogen, tegen horrorfilm-broeders in het ziekenhuis en hoe ze haar geliefde uiteindelijk verliest.

But the story of Jeanne - the girl - whose sister was murdered by the English, who sought an escape from a violent father and a forced marriage, who taught herself to ride and fight, and who somehow found the courage and tenacity to convince first one, then two, then thousands to follow her, is at once thrilling, unexpected and heart-breaking.

While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her ""power"" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered.

"Kingsley Amis, David Lodge (Introduction)",Lucky Jim,,English,,"Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century, Lucky Jim remains as trenchant, withering, and eloquently misanthropic as when it first scandalized readers in 1954. This is the story of Jim Dixon, a hapless lecturer in medieval history at a provincial university who knows better than most that “there was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.” Kingsley Amis’s scabrous debut leads the reader through a gallery of emphatically English bores, cranks, frauds, and neurotics with whom Dixon must contend in one way or another in order to hold on to his cushy academic perch and win the girl of his fancy.More than just a merciless satire of cloistered college life and stuffy postwar manners, Lucky Jim is an attack on the forces of boredom, whatever form they may take, and a work of art that at once distills and extends an entire tradition of English comic writing, from Fielding and Dickens through Wodehouse and Waugh. As Christopher Hitchens has written, “If you can picture Bertie or Jeeves being capable of actual malice, and simultaneously imagine Evelyn Waugh forgetting about original sin, you have the combination of innocence and experience that makes this short romp so imperishable.”",,,10/28/54,September 1st 1993,['Jim Dixon'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Comedy', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Academia']",,9780140186307,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373459729l/395182.jpg,3.77,['Somerset Maugham Award (1955)'],1027.0,14.0,,395182.Lucky_Jim,,,,,89.0,24978.0,251,,Penguin Classics,"['6699', '9162', '6480', '1960', '677']",,,[],,

These persons also blocked her appointment as police commissioner. This kind of sabotage was the proverbial last straw that compelled her to 'shake off the shackles'. After a long and rewarding innings (35 years in all), Kiran Bedi decided to move on. She believed that she could no longer work with persons who were keeping the system enslaved. She was clear in her mind that she was not going to be subordinated by this team of saboteurs. What direction and leadership would such persons provide except to create pygmies and stifle initiative and crush morale? She did not want to be a part of such dubious 'history'. As she asserts: 'My self-respect, my innate sense of justice and my beliefs and values in life propelled me to throw off the ""yokes"" that were already obstructing my growth and I now made up my mind to set myself free and be a master of my own time.' This is a no-holds-barred narrative packed with punch, spirit and vitality. Chosen as 'India's most admired woman', Kiran Bedi is a highly recognized and decorated police officer, who has won several accolades, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service.

From boyhood, his restless creativity had continually surprised his family, but his departure shook up everyone— especially Kirin, who adored her high-spirited, charismatic brother.A touching, funny, and always affectionate memoir, My Family and Other Saints traces the reverberations of Rahoul's spiritual journey through the entire family. As their beachside Bombay home becomes a crossroads for Westerners seeking Eastern enlightenment, Kirin’s sari-wearing American mother wholeheartedly embraces ashrams and gurus, adopting her son’s spiritual quest as her own. Her Indian father, however, coins the term “urug”—guru spelled backward—to mock these seekers, while young Kirin, surrounded by radiant holy men, parents drifting apart, and a motley of young, often eccentric Westerners, is left to find her own answers. Deftly recreating the turbulent emotional world of her bicultural adolescence, but overlaying it with the hard-won understanding of adulthood, Narayan presents a large, rambunctious cast of quirky characters.

Kirk Douglas,"Let's Face It: 90 Years of Living, Loving, and Learning",,English,,"He has been one of the brightest stars in Hollywood, a hard-charging actor whose intensity on the screen has been mirrored in his personal life. As Kirk Douglas has grown older - he turned ninety in December 2006 - he has become less impetuous and more reflective. In this poignant and inspiring new memoir, Douglas contemplates what life is all about, weighing current events from his present frame of mind while summoning the passions of his younger days.Kirk Douglas is a born storyteller, and throughout Let's Face It he tells wonderful tales and shares favorite jokes and hard-won insights. In the book, he explores the mixed blessings of growing older and looks back at his childhood, his young adulthood, and his storied, glamorous, and colorful life and career in Hollywood. He tells delightful stories of the making of such films as Spartacus, Lust for Life, Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful, and many others. He includes anecdotes about his friends Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall, Ronald Reagan, Ava Gardner, Henry Kissinger, Fred Astaire, Yul Brynner, John Wayne, and Johnny Cash. He reveals the secrets that have kept him and his wife, Anne, happily married for more than five decades, and talks fondly and movingly of times spent with his sons, Michael, Peter, Eric, and Joel, and his grandchildren.Douglas's life has been filled with pain as well as joy. In Let's Face It, he writes frankly for the first time about the tragic death of his son Eric from a drug overdose at age forty-five. Douglas tells what it was like to recover from several near-death episodes, including a helicopter crash, a stroke, and a cardiac event. He writes of his sadness that many of his closest friends are no longer with us; the book includes many moving stories such as one about a regular poker game at Frank Sinatra's house at which he and Anne have been fixtures along with Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, and their wives. Though many of the players are gone, the game continues to this day.In Let's Face It, Douglas reflects on how his Jewish faith has become more and more important to him over the years. He offers strong opinions on everything from anti-Semitism to corporate greed, from racism to Hurricane Katrina, and from the war in Iraq to the situation in Israel. He writes about the importance in his life of the need to improve education for all children and about how we need to care more about the world and less about ourselves.A must-read for every fan, this engrossing memoir provides an indelible self-portrait of a great star - while sharing the wit and wisdom Kirk Douglas has accumulated over a lifetime.",,,01/01/07,March 1st 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Film', 'Media Tie In', 'Adult']",,9780470084694,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410765455l/411746.jpg,3.77,[],94.0,1.0,,411746.Let_s_Face_It,,,,,92.0,207.0,272,,Wiley,"['49', '80', '62', '13', '3']",,,[],,

Kit Reed,Thinner Than Thou,,English,,"In the tomorrow of Thinner Than Thou, the cult of the body has become the one true religion. The Dedicated Sisters are a religious order sworn to help anorexic, bulimic, and morbidly obese youth. Throughout the land, houses of worship have been replaced by the health clubs of the Crossed Triceps. And through hypnotically powerful evangelical infomercials, the Reverend Earl preaches the heaven of the Afterfat, where you will look like a Greek god and can eat anything you want. Just sign over your life savings and come to Sylphania, the most luxurious weight-loss spa in the world, where the Reverend himself will personally supervise your attainment of physical perfection.But the glory of youth and thinness that America worships conceals a hidden world where teens train for the competitive eating circuit, where fat porn and obese strippers feed people's dark desires, and where an underground railroad of rebellious religions remember when people worshipped God instead of the Afterfat.As Annie, an anorexic, and her friend Kelly, who is so massive she can barely walk, find out, the tender promises of the Dedicated Sisters are fulfilled by forced feedings and enforced starvation in hidden prisons. As middle-aged Jeremy discovers, Sylphania is a concentration camp where failure to lose weight and tone up leads to brutal punishment. The Rev. Earl's public sympathy for the overweight conceals a private contempt . . . and, beneath that, a terrible longing known only to a select few. The inevitable decay of old age is the only thing keeping mankind from reaching perfection. Luckily, Reverend Earl has a plan that will take care of that . . . .",,,10/30/04,June 1st 2005,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Mental Health', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",,9780765311955,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312034066l/284295.jpg,3.17,['ALA Alex Award (2005)'],112.0,2.0,,284295.Thinner_Than_Thou,,,,,71.0,386.0,336,,Tor Books,"['55', '102', '118', '74', '37']",,,[],,

Maybe that's not so bad, considering Miss Yukari's not the brightest bulb in the bunch and has her students correcting her on many technical points. Her students aren't sure how to react, but their bewilderment is half the charm of this manga. Like the 1980s TV series Head of the Class, Azu has an eclectic mix of pupils ranging from child geniuses to sports enthusiasts to tough girls; each possessing much more than meets the eye. The precocious child genius may be great at academic subjects, but she still draws like a little girl and has the emotions of a kid. The unemotional tough teen melts for tiny animals and longs to have a pet of her own, even if all of the creatures she comes in contact with seem to hate her. The art is simple and minimalistic, but adequately conveys the thought and emotion behind each strip. Azuma's cast has depth, dimension and character, and their story heartily entertains.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

What separates the much-needed rainfall from the devastating hurricane is our ability to navigate these storms with grace and clarity. This book provides the necessary insights and practical tools for embracing the storms we all face such that we are left more conscious and more empowered.  In this book Dr. Gubacs describes the major expected and unexpected life transitions and their key components. Through a variety of life stories and experiences, the reader will see how the external and internal components of a transition can impact their life. It explains the different stages of transitions and helps readers to identify what big transitions they are currently navigating. By understanding their own transitions, the readers are better able to appreciate how those transitions are causing or influencing the smaller, day-to-day challenges they experience in their lives. The readers will also be presented with and taught to apply practical tools for successfully weathering their life storms.

"Klaus Mann, Robin Smyth (Translator)",Mephisto,,English,,"Klaus Mann - Thomas Mann’s son - wrote MEPHISTO while living in exile from the Germany of World War II. In it he captures the Isherwood-like atmosphere of Nazi Germany while telling a satiric story about the rise to power of one man - a thinly veiled caricature of his own brother-in-law. The man is Hendrik Hofgen, a character actor who in his own life plays a bizarre part in the elite circle of the Third Reich. Hofgen is publicly a revolutionary, but secretly he is a man driven by an obsessive need for power and fame. Although he benefits from the prestige of being married to the daughter of an eminent politician, he endangers his rise in Nazi society by his compulsive involvement with ‘a black Venus.’ His brilliant success as Mephisto in FAUST brings him the support of the Führer’s prime minister, who appoints him head of the State Theater. His dreams are finally realized, but the story ends on a note of despair as Hofgen is forced to confront the emptiness of his life. Mann weaves his tale with amazing skill. The result is a fascinating novel of decadence and evil.Klaus Mann, the second child of Thomas Mann, was born in Munich in 1906. He began writing short stories and articles in 1924, and within a year was a theatrical critic for a Berlin newspaper. In 1925 both a volume of short stories and his first novel, THE PIOUS DANCE, were published. His sister, Erika, to whom he was very close, was in the cast of his first play, ANJA AND ESTHER. Mann left Germany in 1933 and lived in Amsterdam until 1936, during which time he became a Czechoslovakian citizen, having been deprived of his German citizenship by the Nazis. He moved to America in 1936, living in Princeton, New Jersey, and New York City. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. He died at the age of forty-two in Cannes, France.

Kobie Krüger,The Wilderness Family: At Home with Africa's Wildlife,,English,,"Everyone warned Kobie Krüger that being the wife of a game warden at a remote ranger station in South Africa's largest national park would be an arduous move. The heat was unbearable, malaria would be a constant danger, her husband would have to be away for long stretches, there were no schools or nearby doctors for their three daughters, and of course the area teemed with wild animals. Yet for Kobie and her family, the seventeen years at South Africa's Kruger National Park were the most magical of their lives. Now, in The Wilderness Family, Kobie recounts the enchanting adventures and extraordinary encounters they experienced in this vast reserve where wildlife has right of way.Kobie and her husband Kobus were overwhelmed by the beauty of the Mahlangeni ranger station when they arrived with their little girls in the autumn of 1980. Golden sunshine glowed in the lush garden where fruit bats hung in the sausage trees; hippos basked in the glittering waters of the Letaba River; storks and herons perched along the shore. Kobie felt she had found heaven on earth--until she awoke that first night to find a python slithering silently across her bedroom floor. It was the perfect introduction to the wonders and terrors that awaited her.As the Krügers settled in, they became accustomed to living in the midst of ravishing splendor and daily surprises. A honey badger they nursed back to health rampaged affectionately through the house. Sneaky hyenas stole blankets and cook pots. Ordinarily placid elephants grew foul-tempered and violent in the summer heat. And one terrible day, the shadow of tragedy fell across the family when a lion attacked Kobus in the bush and nearly killed him.But nothing prepared the Krügers for the adventure of raising an orphaned lion cub. The cub was only a few days old and on the verge of death when they found him alone.  Leo, as the girls promptly named the cub, survived on loads of love and bottles of fat-enriched milk, and soon became an affectionate, rambunctious member of the family. At the heart of the book, Kobie recounts the unique bond that each of the Krügers forged with Leo and their sometimes hilarious endeavor to teach him to become a ""real"" lion and live with his own kind in the wild.Writing with deep affection and luminous prose, Kobie Krüger captures here the mystery of untamed Africa--its fathomless skies, soulful landscapes, and most of all, its astonishing array of animals. By turns funny and heart-breaking, engaging and suspenseful, The Wilderness Family is an unforgettable memoir of a woman, her family, and the amazing game reserve they called home for seventeen incredible years.",,,10/30/01,May 1st 2001,[],Hardcover,"['Africa', 'Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'South Africa', 'Nature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Wildlife']",,9780345444264,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1178742259l/830265.jpg,4.46,['ALA Alex Award (2002)'],100.0,1.0,,830265.The_Wilderness_Family,,,,,97.0,1123.0,400,,Ballantine Books,"['691', '293', '109', '21', '9']",,,[],,

Kola Boof,Diary of a Lost Girl: The Autobiography of Kola Boof,,English,,"Kola Boof's long awaited autobiography ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" is nothing less than magnificent. Many will be spellbound by more than 90 pages detailing her terrifying experience as Osama Bin Laden's former mistress, but the Sudanese-born Novelist/Poet writes even more profoundly about the hardships of being vaginally circumcised, about witnessing her birth parents killed in her presence as a small child, about slavery and Arabism in Sudan, about being adopted and raised in the U.S. by African Americans, about her quest for true love, and in one particularly daring chapter, about her hopes for the future of her sons. Add to that years of psychiatric treatment, a struggle with manic anger and quite a few daring romances other than Bin Laden and you've got the perfect ingredients for a feature film.Critically acclaimed for her powerful novels ""Flesh and the Devil"", ""Pure Nigger Evil"" and the classic short story collection, ""Long Train to the Redeeming Sin""...I'm now convinced that there's no way Kola Boof could ever create a fictional character in one of her novels that is more glamorous, sad, enigmatic and intriguing than she herself is in real life.",,,11/06/03,February 1st 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Autobiography', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir']",,9780971201989,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172479375l/180026._SX318_.jpg,3.11,[],87.0,1.0,,180026.Diary_of_a_Lost_Girl,,,,,63.0,706.0,441,,Door of Kush,"['152', '165', '128', '130', '131']",,,[],,

"Koon Woon (Goodreads Author), Joneve McCormick, Changming Yuan",Three Poets: Voices from the West Coast,,English,,"In fewer words than History uses, Poetry tells us where we are, where we have been, and where we are going. It does so without a literal rendering, for the complexity is impossible to articulate, save in metaphors – the dark horse of language. In this slim volume, three seasoned voices from the Pacific Coast show us the joys of being here, in this time and place. These three poets are bound by where they live on the West Coast of the North American continent. There are the urban poems of Koon Woon that ring of Seattle and San Francisco, where he is compassionate of those who probe with lonely eyes. He is a “weaver of dreams,” that no matter what “the odds,” or “however deep the night,” he “expects morning.”Joneve McCormick evokes, through the Santa Barbara seascape of beaches, ocean and surf, sea birds, barnacles and rocks, things more permanent. She speaks of friendship as “a dam near my home, or a raging river. / I am lucky - / I’ve had both.” She speaks of love as something “soul to soul,” something that “moves without moving” – a “communion” no less.Changming Yuan brings with him the ancient wisdom of China, and through crisp poetic devices transports us to higher planes of being and consciousness, giving a mini-course in philosophy as it were, and presenting a sumptuous Chinese banquet; Yuan literally transports us to that seemingly changeless land, where Fengshui and the theories of ying – yang, and the ancient science of “five elements” still hold sway over us all.

Eye-opening and utterly gripping, Koren Zailckas’s story is that of thousands of girls like her who are not alcoholics yet but who routinely use booze as a shortcut to courage and a stand-in for good judgment.With one stiff sip of Southern Comfort at the age of fourteen, Zailckas is initiated into the world of drinking. From then on, she will drink faithfully, fanatically. In high school, her experimentation will lead to a stomach pumping. In college, her excess will give way to a pattern of self-poisoning that will grow more destructive each year. At age twenty-two, Zailckas will wake up in an unfamiliar apartment in New York City, elbow her friend who is passed out next to her, and ask, ""Where are we?"" Smashed is a sober look at how she got there and, after years of blackouts and smashups, what it took for her to realize she had to stop drinking.

Kory Stamper (Goodreads Author),Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries,,English,,"Brimming with intelligence and personality, a vastly entertaining account of how dictionaries are made a must read for word mavens.  While most of us might take dictionaries for granted, the process of writing them is in fact as lively and dynamic as language itself. With sharp wit and irreverence, Kory Stamper cracks open the complex, obsessive world of lexicography--from the agonizing decisions about what and how to define, to the knotty questions of usage in an ever-changing language. She explains why small words are the most difficult to define (have you ever tried to define is ?), how it can take nine months to define a single word, and how our biases about language and pronunciation can have tremendous social influence. Throughout, Stamper brings to life the hallowed halls (and highly idiosyncratic cubicles) of Merriam-Webster, a world inhabited by quirky, erudite individuals who quietly shape the way we communicate. A sure delight for all lovers of words, Word by Word might also quietly improve readers grasp and use of the English language.""",,,,March 14th 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Language', 'Books About Books', 'Linguistics', 'Writing', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Humor']",,9781101870945,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1471282375l/30781490.jpg,4.18,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2017)'],98.0,2.0,,30781490-word-by-word,,,,,96.0,6513.0,296,,Pantheon Books,"['2673', '2662', '938', '188', '52']",,,[],,

Kris E. Lane,Quito 1599,City and Colony in Transition,,History,"Quito has always been one of the most enigmatic of colonial Spanish American cities. The history of its enormous hinterland, only a fraction of which forms the modern Republic of Ecuador, is even less known. This engaging book takes the watershed year 1599 as a starting point for a provocative reinterpretation of the history of Quito, city and colony. The result is a lively narrative that is also an original inquiry into the driving forces behind sixteenth-century Spanish colonialism. In six overlapping topical narratives Lane brings to life a place wracked by civil disturbances, shipwrecks, indigenous uprisings, pirate attacks, maroon intransigence, urban decadence, failed missionary endeavors, sharp economic reorientations, and wily and unpredictable subaltern adaptation and resistance. Drawing from a wealth of recent research on the colonial north Andes and on more than seven years of study in the archives of Ecuador, Colombia, and Spain, Lane presents rich discoveries of interest to economic historians, including a previously unknown gold boom; however, his primary interest is people. He explores the ways both individuals and groups--shipwreck victims, slaves, laborers, merchants, traders--faced obstacles and seized (or missed) opportunities, showing readers not only the basic facts and major themes of colonial life but also the influence and outcome of individual hopes and fears among people from a multitude of races and ethnicities.",,,,2002.0,,,,082632357X,9780826323576,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otABiA17lNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.59,,,,,,,,,,,,312.0,,,,21.0,,,,

History shows the sad consequences as the serpent continues to deceive regarding woman's role and purpose. But as Kris Vallotton explains, that was not God's final answer. The drive to disempower and deface women was the devil's idea--not God's. Through the cross of Christ, the power of the curse in the Garden was broken forever. Taking the reader by the hand for a walk through Scripture, this leader and bestselling author reveals: - God's true plan for women- simple steps for removing the ancient - patterns of enslavement- Jesus's care for women- the true meaning of the apostle Paul's exhortations about women- various examples of women in leadership as God intended In the Garden, the woman was taken out of the man to stand by his side and co-reign with him.

Kris Vallotton,"Heavy Rain: Renew the Church, Transform the World",,English,,"We owe the world an encounter with God. We In the midst of the darkest epoch season in human history, Jesus Christ had the audacity to teach us a prayer so powerful that it defies human reason. It would be forever remembered as “The Lord’s Prayer.” Jesus turned to his tattered brigade of spiritual warriors and said, “Pray that My Father’s kingdom would come and His will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.”           Was this prayer a sort of wish upon a star, intended to be prayed by billions, but only to be experienced by a few in some distant eternity? Is the earth eroding, or is it evolving? Is global warming the beginning of the intense heat that will reduce our world to a hot rock spinning hopelessly through space? Will evil finally triumph over good, leaving terrorism to ravage the righteous, rape the innocent, and pillage our children? Will some maniac dictator finally push the button and blow us into obliteration?         The purpose of this book is to unearth the ancient mysteries that answer these questions and prepares the Church for a revolution that transforms every realm of society. God wants heaven to invade earth so that earth will look like heaven. God is reforming the Church, moving believers from denominationalism to apostolic families, where true spiritual leaders don’t control people but empower people to find their God-given destiny.       ",,,11/06/10,October 7th 2010,[],Paperback,"['Christianity', 'Faith', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Supernatural']",,9780830756643,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328778646l/9155291.jpg,4.36,[],89.0,1.0,,9155291-heavy-rain,,,,,95.0,278.0,240,,Regal,"['168', '63', '32', '9', '6']",,,[],,

One day, when the teasing was just too much, she used one of her wishes. She told Fazire she wanted to find a man like in her books and she made the most complicated wish Fazire had ever heard.

Back at court Karigan found the Green Riders weakened and diminished. Rider magic was becoming unreliable, and she herself was having ghostly visions--visions of a strong woman with wild flowing hair and a blue and green tartan draped across her shoulder, pinned with a golden brooch. This woman was no stranger to Karigan nor would she have been to any Green Rider, for she was Lil Ambriodhe, First Rider, and founder of the Green Rider corps. But why was she appearing to Karigan? And would Karigan be able to seek the help of a woman who had been dead for a thousand years?",Green Rider #2,,10/28/03,August 3rd 2004,"[""Karigan G'ladheon""]",Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'High Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Adult']",,9780756401931,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347642517l/147844.jpg,4.21,[],592.0,8.0,,147844.First_Rider_s_Call,,,,,97.0,20791.0,596,,DAW,"['9030', '7835', '3292', '517', '117']",,,[],,

Kristen Britain,Mirror Sight,,English,,"Karigan G'ladheon is a Green Rider--a seasoned member of the elite messenger corps of King Zachary of Sacoridia. This corps of messengers, each gifted with a brooch of office that imparts a unique magical ability to its wearer, was founded over a thousand years ago during the terrible time of the Long War.During that spell-fueled war, Sacoridia was besieged by the sorcerous armies of the Arcosian Empire, led by Mornhavon the Black. When Sacoridia finally triumphed, Mornhavon resorted to dark magic that rendered his twisted spirit immortal. Determined to keep the realm safe from this terrifying enemy, multitudes of Sacoridian magicians sacrificed their lives to build the immense D'Yer Wall, imprisoning the dangerous spirit of Mornhavon in Blackveil Forest, which uncontrolled magic had mutated into a perilous and unnatural place.For over a thousand years, the magic of the D'Yer Wall protected the people of Sacoridia, but as the centuries passed, memory of how the wall had been built was lost as a traumatized nation turned its back on magic. And when a malicious entity cracked the massive wall, there were none left who knew how to repair it. Desperate to regain the knowledge and repair the ever-expanding breach in the wall, agents of the king scoured the kingdom for magical relics and information. Finally, in a last-ditch attempt to gain time, Karigan, whose Rider brooch enabled her to ""fade""--sometimes traversing the layers of time and space--was able to catapult the spirit of Mornhavon into the future. But how far into the future was anyone's guess.Realizing that this might be their only chance to enter Blackveil and examine the tainted peninsula, King Zachary sends Karigan and a contingent of Sacoridians beyond the wall, along with an equal number of Eletians--the immortal race that eons ago lived in what is now Blackveil Forest. But in addition to the unnatural dangers of the forest itself, Karigan and her small delegation have been followed by a secret rebel sect--descendants of the original Arcosian invaders, and during a showdown between these two groups, Mornhavon suddenly reappears.In the magical confrontation that follows, Karigan is jolted out of Blackveil and wakes in a darkness blacker than night. She's lying on smooth, cold stone, but as she reaches out, she realizes that the stone is not just beneath her, but above and around her as well. She's landed in a sealed stone sarcophagus, some unknown tomb, and the air is becoming thin.Is this to be her end? If she escapes, where will she find herself? Is she still in the world she remembers, or has the magical explosion transported her somewhere completely different? To find out, she must first win free of her prison--before it becomes her grave. And should she succeed, will she be walking straight into a trap created by Mornhavon himself?",Green Rider #5,,,May 6th 2014,"[""Karigan G'ladheon"", 'King Zachary', 'Captain Laren Mapstone']",Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'High Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult']",,9780756408794,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380222695l/18249280.jpg,3.82,[],210.0,3.0,,18249280-mirror-sight,,,,,87.0,7167.0,784,,DAW,"['2372', '2364', '1489', '650', '292']",,,[],,

Kristen Iversen (Goodreads Author),Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats,,English,,"Full Body Burden is a haunting work of narrative nonfiction about a young woman, Kristen Iversen, growing up in a small Colorado town close to Rocky Flats, a secret nuclear weapons plant once designated ""the most contaminated site in America."" It's the story of a childhood and adolescence in the shadow of the Cold War, in a landscape at once startlingly beautiful and—unknown to those who lived there—tainted with invisible yet deadly particles of plutonium.It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets—both family and government. Her father's hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what was made at Rocky Flats (cleaning supplies, her mother guessed)—best not to inquire too deeply into any of it.But as Iversen grew older, she began to ask questions. She learned about the infamous 1969 Mother's Day fire, in which a few scraps of plutonium spontaneously ignited and—despite the desperate efforts of firefighters—came perilously close to a ""criticality,"" the deadly blue flash that signals a nuclear chain reaction. Intense heat and radiation almost melted the roof, which nearly resulted in an explosion that would have had devastating consequences for the entire Denver metro area. Yet the only mention of the fire was on page 28 of the Rocky Mountain News, underneath a photo of the Pet of the Week. In her early thirties, Iversen even worked at Rocky Flats for a time, typing up memos in which accidents were always called ""incidents.""And as this memoir unfolds, it reveals itself as a brilliant work of investigative journalism—a detailed and shocking account of the government's sustained attempt to conceal the effects of the toxic and radioactive waste released by Rocky Flats, and of local residents' vain attempts to seek justice in court. Here, too, are vivid portraits of former Rocky Flats workers—from the healthy, who regard their work at the plant with pride and patriotism, to the ill or dying, who battle for compensation for cancers they got on the job.Based on extensive interviews, FBI and EPA documents, and class-action testimony, this taut, beautifully written book promises to have a very long half-life.",,,January 1st 2012,June 5th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Science', 'Biography', 'Environment', 'Politics', 'Health', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook']",,9780307955630,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332528768l/13153931.jpg,4.02,"['Colorado Book Award for General Nonfiction (2013)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)']",25.0,1.0,,13153931-full-body-burden,,,,,95.0,3121.0,416,,Crown,"['1011', '1342', '627', '111', '30']",,,['Colorado (United States)'],,

The attraction is immediate and the chemistry is off the charts, but Kate has heard all about Eli’s playboy past and she has a job to do. Sleeping with the boss isn’t a part of that job, even if just the sound of her name rolling off that Cajun tongue and the way he fills out a designer suit does make her sweat. Eli’s southern charms surprise Kate. The man whose reputation labels him as a ruthless, callous womanizer is not the man she’s coming to know intimately. He’s generous, protective and makes her smile. Cracking through Kate’s cool, reserved demeanor and discovering her love of sexy, expensive lingerie is a challenge Eli can’t resist, but her sweet nature, love of family and sense of humor pull at him in ways no one else ever has. But when the person responsible for trying to single-handedly dismantle Eli’s empire comes to light, and it’s time for Kate to move on, to what lengths will Eli go to keep the woman he’s fallen in love with by his side?",Boudreaux #1,,02/18/15,March 3rd 2015,"['Eli Boudreaux', ""Kate O'Shaughnessy""]",Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Chick Lit', 'New Adult', 'Erotica', 'Abuse', 'Fiction']",,B00ROFITIE,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420241163l/23656346.jpg,4.11,[],64.0,1.0,,23656346-easy-love,,,,,95.0,16422.0,246,,Ampersand Publishing,"['6428', '6388', '2808', '549', '249']",,,"['New Orleans, Louisiana (United States)']",,

While Simon may have the answers for millions of women all over the world, when it comes to his own love life, he’s a giant, sexy mess.

Kristin Hannah (Goodreads Author),Firefly Lane,,English,,"From the New York Times bestselling author of On Mystic Lake comes a powerful novel of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . .In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend.",Firefly Lane #1,,,February 5th 2008,"['Kate Mularkey', 'Tully Hart']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Drama', 'Womens Fiction', 'Book Club']",,9780312364083,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362435448l/1472878.jpg,4.08,"[""Romantic Times Reviewers' Choice Award (RT Award) Nominee for Women's Fiction (2008)""]",3427.0,44.0,,1472878.Firefly_Lane,,,,,94.0,199333.0,479,,St. Martin's Press,"['79619', '71216', '36532', '8927', '3039']",,,"['Seattle, Washington (United States)']",,

Kristin Kimball,"The Dirty Life: On Farming, Food, and Love",,English,,"""This book is the story of the two love affairs that interrupted the trajectory of my life: one with farming—that dirty, concupiscent art—and the other with a complicated and exasperating farmer.""Single, thirtysomething, working as a writer in New York City, Kristin Kimball was living life as an adventure. But she was beginning to feel a sense of longing for a family and for home. When she interviewed a dynamic young farmer, her world changed. Kristin knew nothing about growing vegetables, let alone raising pigs and cattle and driving horses. But on an impulse, smitten, if not yet in love, she shed her city self and moved to five hundred acres near Lake Champlain to start a new farm with him. The Dirty Life is the captivating chronicle of their first year on Essex Farm, from the cold North Country winter through the following harvest season—complete with their wedding in the loft of the barn. Kimball and her husband had a plan: to grow everything needed to feed a community. It was an ambitious idea, a bit romantic, and it worked. Every Friday evening, all year round, a hundred people travel to Essex Farm to pick up their weekly share of the ""whole diet""—beef, pork, chicken, milk, eggs, maple syrup, grains, flours, dried beans, herbs, fruits, and forty different vegetables—produced by the farm. The work is done by draft horses instead of tractors, and the fertility comes from compost. Kimball’s vivid descriptions of landscape, food, cooking—and marriage—are irresistible. ""As much as you transform the land by farming,"" she writes, ""farming transforms you."" In her old life, Kimball would stay out until four a.m., wear heels, and carry a handbag. Now she wakes up at four, wears Carhartts, and carries a pocket knife. At Essex Farm, she discovers the wrenching pleasures of physical work, learns that good food is at the center of a good life, falls deeply in love, and finally finds the engagement and commitment she craved in the form of a man, a small town, and a beautiful piece of land",,,,October 12th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Food', 'Gardening', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Nature', 'Agriculture', 'Sustainability', 'Audiobook']",,9781416551607,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1277929135l/7841677.jpg,4.06,[],58.0,1.0,,7841677-the-dirty-life,,,,,96.0,15321.0,276,,Scribner,"['5199', '6655', '2823', '505', '139']",,,[],,

Kristine Barnett,The Spark: A Mother's Story of Nurturing Genius,,English,,"Kristine Barnett’s son Jacob has an IQ higher than Einstein’s, a photographic memory, and he taught himself calculus in two weeks. At nine he started working on an original theory in astrophysics that experts believe may someday put him in line for a Nobel Prize, and at age twelve he became a paid researcher in quantum physics. But the story of Kristine’s journey with Jake is all the more remarkable because his extraordinary mind was almost lost to autism. At age two, when Jake was diagnosed, Kristine was told he might never be able to tie his own shoes. The Spark is a remarkable memoir of mother and son. Surrounded by “experts” at home and in special ed who tried to focus on Jake’s most basic skills and curtail his distracting interests—moving shadows on the wall, stars, plaid patterns on sofa fabric—Jake made no progress, withdrew more and more into his own world, and eventually stopped talking completely. Kristine knew in her heart that she had to make a change. Against the advice of her husband, Michael, and the developmental specialists, Kristine followed her instincts, pulled Jake out of special ed, and began preparing him for mainstream kindergarten on her own. Relying on the insights she developed at the daycare center she runs out of the garage in her home, Kristine resolved to follow Jacob’s “spark”—his passionate interests. Why concentrate on what he couldn’t do? Why not focus on what he could? This basic philosophy, along with her belief in the power of ordinary childhood experiences (softball, picnics, s’mores around the campfire) and the importance of play, helped Kristine overcome huge odds. The Barnetts were not wealthy people, and in addition to financial hardship, Kristine herself faced serious health issues. But through hard work and determination on behalf of Jake and his two younger brothers, as well as an undying faith in their community, friends, and family, Kristine and Michael prevailed. The results were beyond anything anyone could have imagined. Dramatic, inspiring, and transformative, The Spark is about the power of love and courage in the face of overwhelming obstacles, and the dazzling possibilities that can occur when we learn how to tap the true potential that lies within every child, and in all of us.",,,,April 9th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Education', 'Psychology', 'Biography Memoir', 'Inspirational', 'Science', 'Book Club']",,9780812993370,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361254944l/15798364.jpg,4.14,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2013)'],65.0,1.0,,15798364-the-spark,,,,,94.0,6948.0,250,,Random House,"['3052', '2379', '1080', '286', '151']",,,"['Indianapolis, Indiana (United States)']",,

Is she better off leaving well enough alone?  Jelani Graybourne was the man of many women's dreams. He’s lived a successful, mistake-free life, until he met the one mistake that was Samantha Wells. She’s made promises she always kept. Now, she’s back, and unlike her first time around, loving Jelani might not be the first thing on her mind. If she has her way, her plan could topple the foundation on which the Graybourne brand is built. Jelani was able to avoid her ruin once, but could he avert her devious plot again?

Kristopher Cruz (Goodreads Author),Provenance,,English,,"Spellscribed is a series of fantasy novels revolving around the protagonist, a young and inexperienced Wizard named Endrance. Born the night that the Archmagus Valeria died, Endrance was gifted with the talent and mind for magic. He'd proven that he was more than capable of mastering the forces of magic and intellectual study at the hands of a master as mad as he was crafty. He was one of the Scribed, mages who had undergone a painful yet powerful ritual that granted them the ability to tattoo spells upon their very skin.He had finally proven himself to his master, and was free to practice magic at his own pace. If that were all fate had in store for him, he would have been happy. However fate wanted more of this man's potential than a lifetime of quiet study.Instead, he was appointed the Spengur of Balator, a country radically different from his own. He would face an entire city of people that prized physical might and shunned the mystic. There he would meet staunch allies, and dangerous foes. There, he could change the world, if he could only survive.It is through the fires of strife that a person is melted down into the core of who they really are, and fate has stoked the flames white hot.

Take Esther’s father, for instance: He’s an agoraphobe who hasn’t left the basement in six years. Then there’s her twin brother, Eugene, whose fear of the dark goes far beyond the things that go bump in the night. And her mother, Rosemary, is absolutely terrified of bad luck.As for Esther, she’s managed to escape the curse…so far. She doesn’t yet have a great fear because she avoids pretty much everything.

Esther thinks she has it all figured out, until she’s reunited with an old elementary school classmate—and first crush—Jonah Smallwood. The encounter leaves her stranded at a bus stop and swindled out of her phone, all her cash, a Fruit Roll-Up she’d been saving, and her list—not to mention her dignity. But the theft is also the beginning of an unexpected friendship between the two, one that sends the pair on a journey of self-discovery as they try to break the curse that’s consumed Esther’s family.

Krzysztof Andrzejczak,The Writer in the Writing: Author as Hero in Postwar American Fiction,,English,,"The structure of this study, although implicitly chronological, is above all thematic. The Introduction focuses on how the novels of the 1950s and early 1960s reflect, comically and absurdly, a sense of exhaustion and depravity, mental numbness and emptiness. Writer-protagonists project themselves as murky and haunted selves determined by exterior chaos and complemented by interior anxiety, as unaccomplished artisans nvoived in futile attempts to seek renewal.Chapter One deals with the new wave of expression freed by meta-and self-reflexive fiction in the 1960s and later decades. Absorbed by the reflection of fiction itself as technique, writer-heroes discover that confusion and loss may be a way of reclaiming art. They boldly discard older patterns of literary representation, invent verbal labyrinths from which they insist they cannot escape, establish new relationships with other characters, and discover new means of linking the mimetic with the metafictional.Confronting everyday existence, writers in fiction often vacillate between exuberance and anxiety. Many speak of being lonely and loveless, isolated and withdrawn. In Chapter Two I look at these and other aspects of their confrontation with American experience. Though accusatory, heroes are frequently inspired, or energized, by moral corruption, violence, terrorism or conspiracy. Their views of city life and relationships with women are similarly contradictory. Their perspectives on Europe are an arresting mixture of horror and fascination, puzzlement and confusion.In Chapter Three I look at writers' intellectual, creative and professional concerns. Largely critical of their cultural pedigree, or other writers' views, they concentrate on the challenges and frustrations of a writer ensnared by materialism and media glitz. However, underneath such complaints lies another interesting contradiction. Today's writer-heroes gladly substitute the time-honored tradition of the artist's resistance to fame and wealth for a desire for market success and popularity. These, when they come, bring various forms of backlash, which writers in turns lament and obsessively analyze.",,,,1996,[],Paperback,[],,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1299427831l/10706725.jpg,4.33,[],99.0,1.0,,10706725-the-writer-in-the-writing,,,,,100.0,3.0,172,,University of Lodz,[],,,[],,

When he purchased four acres of land on Vashon Island, he was looking for an affordable home a ferry ride away from the restaurants he ran in Seattle.

Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,The Big Trip Up Yonder,,English,,"The story is set in 2158 A.D., after the invention of a medicine called Anti-Gerasone, which is made from mud and dandelions and is thus inexpensive and widely available. Anti-Gerasone halts the aging process and prevents people from dying of old age as long as they keep taking it; as a result, America now suffers from severe overpopulation and shortages of food and resources. With the exception of the very wealthy, most of the population appears to survive on a diet of foods made from processed seaweed and sawdust. Gramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of his cane, was staring irascibly at the five-foot television screen that dominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing the day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the floor with his cane-tip and shout, ""Hell, we did that a hundred years ago!"" Emerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking that 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back row, behind about a dozen relatives with whom they shared the house. All save Gramps, who was somewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to be about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when anti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since. ""Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the TV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--"" his voice suddenly softened and sweetened--""when they wave that checkered flag at the Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up Yonder."" He sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on not making the slightest sound.

Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater",,English,,"Second only to Slaughterhouse-Five of Vonnegut's canon in its prominence and influence, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965) presents Eliot Rosewater, an itinerant, semi-crazed millionaire wandering the country in search of heritage and philanthropic outcome, introducing the science fiction writer Kilgore Trout to the world and Vonnegut to the collegiate audience which would soon make him a cult writer.Trout, modeled according to Vonnegut on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (with whom Vonnegut had an occasional relationship) is a desperate, impoverished but visionary hack writer who functions for Eliot Rosewater as both conscience and horrid example. Rosewater, seeking to put his inheritance to some meaningful use (his father was an entrepreneur), tries to do good within the context of almost illimitable cynicism and corruption.It is in this novel that Rosewater wanders into a science fiction conference--an actual annual event in Milford, Pennsylvania--and at the motel delivers his famous monologue evoked by science fiction writers and critics for almost half a century: ""None of you can write for sour apples... but you're the only people trying to come to terms with the really terrific things which are happening today."" Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition. The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical. The novel is told mostly thru a collection of short stories dealing with Eliot's interactions with the citizens of Rosewater County, usually with the last sentence serving as a punch line. The antagonist's tale, Mushari's, is told in a similar short essay fashion. The stories reveal different hypocrisies of humankind in a darkly humorous fashion.",,,10/28/65,Published,"['Kilgore Trout', 'Eliot Rosewater', 'Norman Mushari']",Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Science Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Contemporary']",,B005IHWBSY,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481207001l/33290408._SX318_.jpg,3.95,[],1490.0,19.0,,33290408-god-bless-you-mr-rosewater,,,,,95.0,58013.0,290,,RosettaBooks,"['17060', '24355', '13755', '2291', '552']",,,[],,

But on his first night there, a sticky creature shows up in his bedroom and steals Eddie’s journal.

Like clockwork each morning, his mother makes him eggs, lovingly fried into hollowed-out pieces of toast. His father, in the midst of a campaign to revitalize downtown St. Louis, promises to “poke around” for gainful employment for his son. Potter’s best friend, Stuart—an “Independent Thought Contractor” working out of his parents’ lavish pool house—is willing to serve as a kind of life coach, provided, of course, that Potter pays for his services all summer. However...Altogether elsewhere, Potter’s (former? future?) girlfriend, Audrey, is backpacking around Europe with her beautiful bisexual traveling companion, Carmel. Potter was not invited, and getting a good night’s sleep has recently become an issue for him. As enigmatic packages arrive from Audrey, the refuge of life at home soon proves illusory. Potter’s parents are oddly never in the same room together, the neighbor girl is looking quite adult, and Stuart’s much-needed counseling service is subcontracted to a third-party denizen of the pool house with an agenda all his own.

Kyle Keyes,Quantum Roots,,English,,"Federal agents, Alexis Grumman and Jeremy Wade track down a current day vigilante, whose fingerprints match those of a Korean War veteran. Author Kyle Keyes uses characters from two previous novels, to promote a theory that particle energy formats with a quantum root system, that can bypass time and space. Keyes believes that such fiction could turn to fact as we move into the age of quantum mechanics. Adventure fans everywhere should delight in this fast paced action story, that brings yesterday's gun play back to settle cyber-age injustice. Synopsis: Jesse Joe Jacks was born sometime during the snow blizzard of 1923. The Lower Elk County, game warden died from a lightning strike on July 23, 1959, while wearing a sheriff's star. Olan Chapman came to life in August of 1974 and found a computer career with a center city, electronics firm. Chapman drinks heavy and is haunted by flashbacks of an older sister, lost to an unsolved case of gang rape and murder. Jacks loved nature and lived to protect wildlife. He stood tall and fought to uphold justice. Jacks was also a crack shot with a firearm - any firearm.

Kyle Macdonald,One Red Paperclip: Or How an Ordinary Man Achieved His Dream with the Help of a Simple Office Supply,,English,,"Kyle MacDonald had a paperclip. One red paperclip, a dream, and a resume to write. And bills to pay. Oh, and a very patient girlfriend who was paying the rent while he was once again “between jobs.” Kyle wanted to be able to provide for himself and his girlfriend, Dominique. He wanted to own his own home. He wanted something bigger than a paperclip. So he put an ad on Craigslist, the popular classifieds website, with the intention of trading that paperclip for something better. A girl in Vancouver offered him a fish pen in exchange for his paperclip. He traded the fish pen for a doorknob and the doorknob for a camping stove. Before long he had traded the camping stove for a generator for a neon sign. Not long after that, avid snow-globe collector and television star Corbin Bernsen and the small Canadian town of Kipling were involved, and Kyle was on to bigger and better things. In One Red Paperclip, Kyle takes you on a journey around the globe as he moves from paperclip holder to homeowner in just fourteen trades. With plenty of irreverent and insightful anecdotes and practical tips on how you can find your own paperclip and realize your dreams, he proves it’s possible to succeed in life and achieve your dreams on your own terms.

Kyle Mills (Goodreads Author),Sphere of Influence,,English,,"
  Hailed by Tom Clancy as a novelist who is fast becoming ""the new master of gripping and intelligent page-turners,"" Kyle Mills is at the forefront of America's hot new thriller writers. His New York Times bestsellers Storming Heaven and Burn Factor showed Mills to be a storyteller of breathless pacing, stylish prose, and chilling effectiveness. In Sphere of Influence, he takes FBI agent Mark Beamon into unnervingly hazardous territory, with shattering results.
After years of putting truth ahead of protocol, Mark Beamon is languishing in a dead-end job in the Bureau's Phoenix office. But before he can officially be put out to pasture, he's called in for one final assignment.It was supposed to have been fun—a quick undercover job that would temporarily free Beamon from managerial hell. But now his young partner is dead and the FBI is strangely reluctant to ask the questions that could bring his killers to justice.Determined to find the truth even if it destroys him, Beamon plunges headlong into a world of drug trafficking, government corruption, murder, and betrayal. As he penetrates deeper he finds himself tumbling further and further into the undercover persona created for him—that of a cold blooded mercenary known only as Nicolai. Too deep, perhaps, to ever return.When Beamon discovers the existence of the mysterious Christian Volkov—a master criminal and a man with seemingly limitless power—it quickly becomes clear that only through him will Beamon be able to avenge his friend's death and unravel the conspiracy threatening his country. Trapped where the line between international organized crime and world politics blurs hopelessly, Beamon discovers that the stakes are much higher than he ever imagined. And that the enemy is much closer than he thinks.",Mark Beamon #4,,09/30/02,September 2nd 2003,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Action', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Detective', 'Adventure', 'Espionage', 'Crime']",,9780451209443,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391877839l/1046275.jpg,4.05,[],76.0,1.0,,1046275.Sphere_of_Influence,,,,,96.0,1088.0,464,,Signet,"['376', '446', '223', '32', '11']",,,[],,

Kyra Davis (Goodreads Author),Just One Night,,English,,"In this New York Times bestselling erotic enovella trilogy, a buttoned-up businesswoman takes her friend’s advice and has a fling with a stranger on a trip to Vegas—only to find herself under his mysterious, sexy power both in the boardroom and the bedroom. Kasie Fitzgerald knows who she’s supposed to be. She’s a rising-star-workaholic at a global consulting firm. She’s the fiancée of a well-connected man who’s won the approval of her parents. People know that she’s reliable, serious, proper, cautious, pragmatic, and yes, a little predictable. She’s who Dave and her family want her to be. But as her thirtieth birthday looms, buried feelings begin to resurrect. Her friend takes her to Vegas for one last wild and crazy night. In a dress much shorter and sexier than anything she has ever dared to wear before, she hits the blackjack tables. And meets him. Under the tailored clothes it’s clear that this is a man who is intense, powerful, and maybe even a little dangerous. With a touch of trepidation she accepts his invitation to get a drink, and before long, she’s in his hotel room. She never gets his full name. Perhaps his anonymity is one of the reasons she’s able to give herself over to him and to the moment so completely. Perhaps it’s why she’s just had the most exquisite and passionate sex of her life. Shaken by her own behavior, Kasie tries to chalk it up to one crazy night. But when the mysterious gentleman she’s just had a fling with shows up in her office—as the CEO of a firm her company does a billion dollars of business with a year, demanding that she handle his account, and so much more—things will never be the same again.
