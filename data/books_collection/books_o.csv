O Regresso do Jovem Príncipe,,"['Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Contemporary', 'Young Adult', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Magical Realism', 'Middle Grade']","Na remota Patagónia, a quilómetros de qualquer povoado, um viajante encontra um rapaz adormecido à beira da estrada. Está estranhamente vestido, como um pequeno príncipe, esconde-se num manto azul. Perplexo, o viajante pega nele delicadamente. E, em cuidados, leva-o consigo. O menino só acordará mais tarde. Tem o cabelo loiro, da cor do trigo. E muitas perguntas para fazer. Aos poucos revela-se, fala de si, do seu pequeno planeta distante, de uma flor caprichosa que abandonou ao seu destino… e de um pequeno carneiro que aprisionou numa caixa de cartão, para que não fizesse mal à sua flor. O Regresso do Jovem Príncipe é uma história encantada, de A. G. Roemmers, o consagrado poeta Argentino. Ao evocar uma personagem mítica da literatura universal, o autor recupera, neste início de século, uma inocência que temos de preservar.

In Ocean Sea, Alessandro Baricco presents a hypnotizing postmodern fable of human malady--psychological, existential, erotic--and the sea as a means of deliverance. At the Almayer Inn, a remote shoreline hotel, an artist dips his brush in a cup of ocean water to paint a portrait of the sea. A scientist pens love letters to a woman he has yet to meet. An adulteress searches for relief from her proclivity to fall in love. And a sixteen-year-old girl seeks a cure from a mysterious condition which science has failed to remedy.

Ogni storia è una storia d'amore,,"['Italian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Love']","L’amore salva? Quante volte ce lo siamo chiesti, avvertendo al tempo stesso l’urgenza della domanda e la difficoltà di dare una risposta definitiva? Ed è proprio l’interrogativo fondante che Alessandro D’Avenia si pone in apertura di queste pagine, invitandoci a incamminarci con lui alla ricerca di risposte.In questo libro straordinario incontriamo anzitutto una serie di donne, accomunate dal fatto di essere state compagne di vita di grandi artisti: muse, specchi della loro inquietudine e spesso scrittrici, pittrici e scultrici loro stesse, argini all’istinto di autodistruzione, devote assistenti, o invece avversarie, anime inquiete incapaci di trovare pace. Ascoltiamo la frustrazione di Fanny, che Keats magnificava in versi ma con la quale non seppe condividere nemmeno un giorno di quotidianità, ci commuove la caparbietà di Tess Gallagher, poetessa che di Raymond Carver amava tutto e riuscì a portare un po’ di luce nei giorni della sua malattia, ci sconvolge la disperazione di Jeanne Modigliani, ammiriamo i segreti e amorevoli interventi di Alma Hitchcock, condividiamo l’energia quieta e solida di Edith Tolkien.Alessandro D’Avenia cerca di dipanare il gomitolo di tante diversissime storie d’amore, e di intrecciare il filo narrativo che le unisce, in un ordito ricco e cangiante. Per farlo, come un filomito, un “filosofo del mito”, si rivolge all’archetipo di ogni storia d’amore: Euridice e Orfeo. Un mito che svolge la sua funzione di filo (e in greco antico per indicare “filo” e “racconto” si usavano due parole molto simili, mitos e mythos) perché contempla tutte le tappe di una storia d’amore, tra i due poli opposti del disamore (l’egoismo del poeta che alla donna preferisce il proprio canto) e dell’amore stesso (il sacrificio di sé in nome dell’altro).Ogni storia è una storia d’amore è così un libro che muove dalla meraviglia e sa restituire meraviglia al lettore. Perché ancora una volta D’Avenia ci incanta e ci sorprende, riuscendo nell’impresa di coniugare il godimento puro del racconto e il piacere della scoperta. E con slancio ricerca nella letteratura – le storie che alcuni uomini, nel tempo, hanno raccontato su se stessi e l’umanità a cui appartengono – risposte suggestive e potenti, ma anche concrete e vitali. Per poi offrirle in dono ai lettori, schiudendo uno spiraglio da cui lasciar filtrare bagliori di meraviglia nel nostro vivere quotidiano, per rinnovarlo completamente nella certezza che «noi siamo e diventiamo le storie che sappiamo ricordare e raccontare a noi stessi.»",,Scrittori italiani e stranieri,,October 31st 2017,[],Hardcover,,9788804681571,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1507888228l/36404761._SY475_.jpg,3.52,[],82.0,1.0,,,,81.0,626.0,324,Mondadori,"['142', '189', '176', '92', '27']",,[],,"[""Alessandro D'Avenia""]"

One of Us views conjoined twinning and other ""abnormalities"" from the point of view of people living with such anatomies, and considers these issues within the larger historical context of anatomical politics. Anatomy matters, Alice Domurat Dreger tells us, because the senses we possess, the muscles we control, and the resources we require to keep our bodies alive limit and guide what we experience in any given context. Her deeply thought-provoking and compassionate work exposes the breadth and depth of that context--the extent of the social frame upon which we construct the ""normal.""

When Orhan’s brilliant and eccentric grandfather Kemal—a man who built a dynasty out of making kilim rugs—is found dead, submerged in a vat of dye, Orhan inherits the decades-old business. But Kemal’s will raises more questions than it answers. He has left the family estate to a stranger thousands of miles away, an aging woman in an Armenian retirement home in Los Angeles. Her existence and secrecy about her past only deepen the mystery of why Orhan’s grandfather willed his home in Turkey to an unknown woman rather than to his own son or grandson. Left with only Kemal’s ancient sketchbook and intent on righting this injustice, Orhan boards a plane to Los Angeles. There he will not only unearth the story that eighty-seven-year-old Seda so closely guards but discover that Seda’s past now threatens to unravel his future. Her story, if told, has the power to undo the legacy upon which his family has been built.  Moving back and forth in time, between the last years of the Ottoman Empire and the 1990s, Orhan’s Inheritance is a story of passionate love, unspeakable horrors, incredible resilience, and the hidden stories that can haunt a family for generations. “Aline Ohanesian draws from her family’s own dark history to create a tender, powerful story of love and reclamation.

O Cortiço,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Brazil', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'Portuguese Literature', 'School', '19th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']","O Cortiço é um romance de autoria do escritor brasileiro Aluísio Azevedo publicado em 1890. É um marco do naturalismo no Brasil, onde os personagens principais são os moradores de um cortiço no Rio de Janeiro, precursor das favelas, onde moram os excluídos, os humildes, todos aqueles que não se misturavam com a burguesia, e todos eles possuindo os seus problemas e vícios, decorrentes do meio em que vivem. O autor descreve a sociedade brasileira da época, formada pelos portugueses, os burgueses, os negros e os mulatos, pessoas querendo mais e mais dinheiro e poder, pensando em si só, ao mesmo tempo em que presenciam a miséria, ou mesmo a simplicidade de outros.Essa obra de Aluísio Azevedo tem dois elementos importantes: primeiro, o extensivo uso de zoomorfismo. Embalado pela onda científica, Aluísio escreve ""O Cortiço"" sob as bases do determinismo (o meio, o lugar, e o momento influenciam o ser humano) e do darwinismo, com a teoria do evolucionismo. Sob aspectos naturalistas, isto é, sob olhar científico, a narração se desenvolve em meio a insalubridade do cortiço, propício à promiscuidade, característica do naturalismo. Ao contrário do que se desenvolvia no romantismo, Aluísio descreve o coletivo, explicitando a animalização, que é o uso excessivo do zoomorfismo, caracterizando o ser humano como animal, movido pelo instinto e o desejo sexual, onde inaugura uma classe nunca antes representada: o proletário, evidenciando a desigualdade social vivenciada pelo Brasil, juntamente com a ambição do capitalismo selvagem.",,,10/30/90,2008,"['João Romão', 'Comendador Miranda', 'Bertoleza', 'Zulmira', 'Botelho', 'Jerônimo', 'Piedade', 'Rita Baiana', 'Estela', 'Firmo', 'Pombinha', 'Léonie', 'Libório', 'Alexandre', 'Isabel']",Paperback,,9788574805795,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446664794l/27427165.jpg,3.82,[],96.0,1.0,,,,90.0,9625.0,286,Objetivo,"['2842', '3458', '2359', '715', '251']",,"['Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)']",,['Aluísio Azevedo']

When a trunk of family letters gives Amin Maalouf the opportunity to trace his past, he finds himself - having never before asked questions - transfixed by the stories of his ancestors. Starting in the mountains of Lebanon and taking him across the sea to Havana, his history is one of restlessness and exile: of the search for identity, of dramatic emigrations, and of revolutions espoused in the dying years of the Ottoman Empire and beyond.

O Livro das Semelhanças,,"['Poetry', 'Brazil', 'Womens', 'Contemporary', 'Female Authors']","“Houve um tempo em que se usava/ nos livros/ papel de seda para separar/ as palavras e as imagens.” Tais versos, como muitos outros deste O livro das semelhanças, expõem com o wit e a delicadeza característicos da autora esse tatear entre as palavras e as coisas.Em outro poema, significativamente intitulado “Não sei fazer poemas sobre gatos”, a autora admite - com graça e um certo veneno - que as palavras “soltam-se ou/ saltam/ não capturam do gato/ nem a cauda”, para depois concluir, com autoironia devastadora: “sobre a mesa/ quieta e quente/ a folha recém-impressa/ página branca com manchas negras:/ eis o meu poema sobre gatos”.Pois graças a esses e a outros textos, esta nova reunião dos poemas de Ana Martins Marques parece ser a culminação de um dos caminhos mais relevantes da lírica brasileira dos últimos anos. Estão aqui, com uma força que já podia ser antecipada em seus livros anteriores, peças que versam, sobretudo, a respeito da tentativa - sempre temerária, mas também desafiadora - de recuperar o mundo e as coisas por meio da palavra. Porém a autora sabe que vivemos tempos fraturados, em que experimentamos aquilo que poderia ser nomeado como uma certa falência da mimese, pois traduzir o real literariamente é deparar com o abismo que se interpõe entre o mundo sensível e a folha em branco. E Ana desconfia do quanto isso tem de frágil, de problemático - e de igualmente fascinante. Dividido em quatro seções (“Livro”, “Cartografias”, “Visitas ao lugar-comum” e “O livro das semelhanças”), esta obra desperta o leitor para o prazer sempre iluminador e sensível de uma das vozes mais originais da poesia brasileira. Do amor à percepção de que há um espaço - geográfico, quase - para o lugar-comum, do entendimento da precariedade do nosso tempo no mundo à graça (mineira, matreira) proporcionada pela memória: eis uma poeta que nos fala diretamente.

Open,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Book Club', 'American']","From Andre Agassi, one of the most beloved athletes in history and one of the most gifted men ever to step onto a tennis court, a beautiful, haunting autobiography.Agassi’s incredibly rigorous training begins when he is just a child. By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return. And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world’s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations—Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer—Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he’s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he’s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, Open will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi’s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.",,,,November 9th 2009,['Andre Agassi'],Hardcover,,9780307268198,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320520930l/6480781.jpg,4.25,[],458.0,6.0,,,,96.0,80622.0,388,Knopf,"['37556', '29893', '10191', '2017', '965']",,[],,"['Andre Agassi', 'J.

Half-man, half-god, musician, magician, theologian, poet and lover, his story never leaves us. He may be myth, but his lyre still sounds, entrancing everything that hears it: animals, trees, water, stones, and men.In this extraordinary work Ann Wroe goes in search of Orpheus, from the forests where he walked and the mountains where he worshipped to the artefacts, texts and philosophies built up round him. She traces the man, and the power he represents, through the myriad versions of a fantastical life: his birth in Thrace, his studies in Egypt, his voyage with the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece, his love for Eurydice and journey to Hades, and his terrible death. We see him tantalising Cicero and Plato, and breathing new music into Gluck and Monteverdi; occupying the mind of Jung and the surreal dreams of Cocteau; scandalising the Fathers of the early Church, and filling Rilke with poems like a whirlwind.

O Meu Nome é Legião,,"['Fiction', 'Portugal']","O livro começa como um relatório de polícia, descrevendo a vida de um gang numa zona a que se chama simplesmente Bairro e que nos pode fazer evocar um qualquer bairro periférico de uma grande cidade.A legião que é referida no título reporta-se a uma citação do Evangelho de São Lucas, mais precisamente ao seguinte excerto: ««(...) Quando desceu para terra veio-lhes ao encontro um homem da cidade, possesso de vários demónios, que desde há muito não se vestia nem vivia em casa mas nos túmulos. Ao ver Jesus prostrou-se diante dele, gritando em alta voz: 'Que tens que ver comigo Jesus, filho de Deus altíssimo? Peço-te que não me atormentes!» (...) Jesus perguntou-lhe: 'Qual é o teu nome?' 'O meu nome é Legião'. respondeu.Porque muitos demónios tinham entrado nele e suplicavam-lhe que os não mandasse para o abismo.Com O Meu Nome é Legião percorremos, como se fosse a nossa vida, a vida de pessoas que vivem na pior parte do pior sítio do mundo . pessoas que são muitos, sendo o mesmo, e sendo esse «mesmo» uma parte oculta, desesperada e silenciosa de nós, que se esforça por acreditar que há uma salvação.Cruzam-se histórias, tendo quase sempre como pano de fundo o bairro; os conflitos homem/mulher, ricos/probres, brancos/pretos; as histórias não acabam, e é normal - o autor mostra-nos que aquilo que existe de mais parecido com a salvação é esquecer tudo o que aconteceu e pensar:«Não tenho medo de vocês, não tenho medo de nada».",,,,September 2007,[],Paperback,,9789722032254,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1257857398l/5962031.jpg,3.56,[],98.0,1.0,,,,83.0,135.0,380,Publicações Dom Quixote,"['33', '44', '35', '12', '11']",,[],,['António Lobo Antunes']

O romance se tornou um enorme sucesso, vindo a ser o primeiro grande livro sobre o conflito e a independência angolanos e uma referência histórica obrigatória.Numa narrativa não-linear e fragmentada, Lobo Antunes revela as inquietações existenciais de um ser humano, na indelével experiência de uma guerra, que se misturam às memórias de infância e juventude na Lisboa salazarista. O autor utiliza-se, na maior parte do romance, do fluxo de consciência e da associação de idéias, para construir a história e o perfil de seu narrador-protagonista, um personagem que, a partir de ""uma dolorosa aprendizagem da agonia"", vê sua vida e seus valores estilhaçados pela melancolia. O que lhe resta são fragmentos de memória - a criança que visitava com os pais o jardim zoológico aos domingos, o jovem que assiste impassível a seu futuro sendo traçado pela autoridade inquestionável de uma família salazarista, o adulto apático e frustrado diante da violência que lhe retira as rédeas e o sentido da vida.O leitor vai estar frente a frente com ""decadência, putrefação, pestilência e morte. Adicionando canalhice, violência e insensatez"". Para o jornalista português Nuno Barbosa, ""Lobo Antunes, dando plena expressão a uma escrita impiedosa e grosseira consegue uma harmonia preciosa entre a violência do narrado e a rudez dos termos utilizados - as suas palavras ganham, portanto, uma credibilidade muito maior, criando um elo profundo com a realidade.""O livro, que recebeu o prêmio Franco-Português conferido pela Embaixada da França em Lisboa, está na 21.ª edição em Portugal e já foi vendido para mais de dez países como Inglaterra, França, Itália, Alemanha e Suécia.",,,10/30/79,2004,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1257184946l/1487623.jpg,3.96,['PEN Translation Prize Nominee for Margaret Jull Costa (2012)'],181.0,2.0,,,,92.0,1974.0,200,Publicações Dom Quixote,"['686', '736', '394', '107', '51']",,[],,['António Lobo Antunes']

Com a certeza de que o progresso e o mau uso da tecnologia causaram a destruição do mundo, os governantes de Cosmus proibiram a propagação do conhecimento, abolindo os livros e as escolas. É nesse cenário que se passa a história de “Petrus Logus, o Guardião do Tempo”, lançamento da Editora Saraiva e estreia de Augusto Cury na literatura juvenil. No centro da trama está Petrus, filho do rei Apolo, soberano de Cosmus, um jovem apaixonado pelo conhecimento e sem talento para lutas e embates físicos. Educado pelo sábio Malthus para ser um líder justo e generoso, o príncipe começa a questionar o governo do pai, expondo as injustiças sociais e contestando as posições ditatoriais. Seu senso de justiça o leva a conviver com camponeses, algo proibido para um nobre, e no meio daqueles conhece o verdadeiro amor: a jovem Nátila.Sua atitude contestadora o coloca em situações de risco, já que os conselheiros do rei o vêem como uma ameaça à hegemonia do reino e um rebelde que pode fazer o povo se levantar contra os nobres. E, por questionar uma das decisões tomadas por Apolo, Petrus sofre a maior condenação de Cosmus: é obrigado a vestir a temida Máscara da Humilhação.A máscara deixa fortes cicatrizes físicas e emocionais no jovem príncipe, mas não o enfraquece.

One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories,,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Comedy', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Essays', 'Unfinished']","B.J. Novak's One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories is an endlessly entertaining, surprisingly sensitive, and startlingly original debut collection that signals the arrival of a welcome new voice in American fiction.Across a dazzling range of subjects, themes, tones, and narrative voices, Novak's assured prose and expansive imagination introduce readers to people, places, and premises that are hilarious, insightful, provocative, and moving-often at the same time.In One More Thing, a boy wins a $100,000 prize in a box of Frosted Flakes - only to discover that claiming the winnings may unravel his family. A woman sets out to seduce motivational speaker Tony Robbins - turning for help to the famed motivator himself. A school principal unveils a bold plan to permanently abolish arithmetic. An acclaimed ambulance driver seeks the courage to follow his heart and throw it all away to be a singer-songwriter. Author John Grisham contemplates a monumental typo. A new arrival in heaven, overwhelmed by infinite options, procrastinates over his long-ago promise to visit his grandmother. We meet a vengeance-minded hare, obsessed with scoring a rematch against the tortoise who ruined his life; and post-college friends who debate how to stage an intervention in the era of Facebook. We learn why wearing a red t-shirt every day is the key to finding love; how February got its name; and why the stock market is sometimes just... down.Finding inspiration in questions from the nature of perfection to the icing on carrot cake, from the deeply familiar to the intoxicatingly imaginative, One More Thing finds its heart in the most human of phenomena: love, fear, family, ambition, and the inner stirring for the one elusive element that might make a person complete. The stories in this collection are like nothing else, but they have one thing in common: they share the playful humor, deep heart, inquisitive mind, and altogether electrifying spirit of a writer with a fierce devotion to the entertainment of the reader.",,,,February 4th 2014,[],Audio CD,,9780804164733,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388374820l/18007571.jpg,3.68,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Humor (2014)'],75.0,1.0,,,,87.0,41671.0,6,Random House Audio,"['10170', '14827', '11271', '3860', '1543']",,[],,['B.

"One Summer: America, 1927",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Baseball', 'American', 'Adult']","In One Summer Bill Bryson, one of our greatest and most beloved nonfiction writers, transports readers on a journey back to one amazing season in American life.The summer of 1927 began with one of the signature events of the twentieth century: on May 21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh became the first man to cross the Atlantic by plane nonstop, and when he landed in Le Bourget airfield near Paris, he ignited an explosion of worldwide rapture and instantly became the most famous person on the planet. Meanwhile, the titanically talented Babe Ruth was beginning his assault on the home run record, which would culminate on September 30 with his sixtieth blast, one of the most resonant and durable records in sports history. In between those dates a Queens housewife named Ruth Snyder and her corset-salesman lover garroted her husband, leading to a murder trial that became a huge tabloid sensation. Alvin “Shipwreck” Kelly sat atop a flagpole in Newark, New Jersey, for twelve days—a new record. The American South was clobbered by unprecedented rain and by flooding of the Mississippi basin, a great human disaster, the relief efforts for which were guided by the uncannily able and insufferably pompous Herbert Hoover. Calvin Coolidge interrupted an already leisurely presidency for an even more relaxing three-month vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The gangster Al Capone tightened his grip on the illegal booze business through a gaudy and murderous reign of terror and municipal corruption. The first true “talking picture,” Al Jolson’s The Jazz Singer, was filmed and forever changed the motion picture industry. The four most powerful central bankers on earth met in secret session on a Long Island estate and made a fateful decision that virtually guaranteed a future crash and depression.     All this and much, much more transpired in that epochal summer of 1927, and Bill Bryson captures its outsized personalities, exciting events, and occasional just plain weirdness with his trademark vividness, eye for telling detail, and delicious humor. In that year America stepped out onto the world stage as the main event, and One Summer transforms it all into narrative nonfiction of the highest order.",,,08/01/13,October 1st 2013,"['Charles Lindbergh', 'Babe Ruth', 'Al Jolson', 'Herbert Hoover', 'Al Capone', 'Lou Gehrig', 'Philo Farnsworth', 'Gene Tunney', 'Jack Dempsey', 'Calvin Coolidge']",Hardcover,,9780767919401,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380292864l/17262366.jpg,4.08,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2013)'],290.0,4.0,,,,95.0,44513.0,456,Doubleday,"['16235', '18642', '7310', '1527', '799']",,['United States of America'],,['Bill Bryson']

"Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time",,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Parenting', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Sociology', 'Feminism', 'Health']","Overwhelmed is a book about time pressure and modern life. It is a deeply reported and researched, honest and often hilarious journey from feeling that, as one character in the book said, time is like a ""rabid lunatic"" running naked and screaming as your life flies past you, to understanding the historical and cultural roots of the overwhelm, how worrying about all there is to do and the pressure of feeling like we're never have enough time to do it all, or do it well, is ""contaminating"" our experience of time, how time pressure and stress is resculpting our brains and shaping our workplaces, our relationships and squeezing the space that the Greeks said was the point of living a Good Life: that elusive moment of peace called leisure.Author Brigid Schulte, an award-winning journalist for the Washington Post - and harried mother of two - began the journey quite by accident, after a time-use researcher insisted that she, like all American women, had 30 hours of leisure each week. Stunned, she accepted his challenge to keep a time diary and began a journey that would take her from the depths of what she described as the Time Confetti of her days to a conference in Paris with time researchers from around the world, to North Dakota, of all places, where academics are studying the modern love affair with busyness, to Yale, where neuroscientists are finding that feeling overwhelmed is actually shrinking our brains, to exploring new lawsuits uncovering unconscious bias in the workplace, why the US has no real family policy, and where states and cities are filling the federal vacuum.She spent time with mothers drawn to increasingly super intensive parenting standards, and mothers seeking to pull away from it. And she visited the walnut farm of the world's most eminent motherhood researcher, an evolutionary anthropologist, to ask, are mothers just ""naturally"" meant to be the primary parent? The answer will surprise you.Along the way, she was driven by two questions, Why are things the way they are? and, How can they be better? She found real world bright spots of innovative workplaces, couples seeking to shift and share the division of labor at home and work more equitably and traveled to Denmark, the happiest country on earth, where fathers - and mothers - have more pure leisure time than parents in other industrial countries. She devoured research about the science of play, why it's what makes us human, and the feminist leisure research that explains why it's so hard for women to allow themselves to. The answers she found are illuminating, perplexing and ultimately hopeful. The book both outlines the structural and policy changes needed - already underway in small pockets - and mines the latest human performance and motivation science to show the way out of the overwhelm and toward a state that time use researchers call ...

When he finds a local hunting outfitter dead, splayed out on the woodpile behind his state-owned home, he takes it personally. There had to be a reason that the outfitter, with whom he's had run-ins before, chose his backyard, his woodpile to die in. Even after the ""outfitter murders,"" as they have been dubbed by the local press after the discovery of the two more bodies, are solved, Joe continues to investigate, uneasy with the easy explanation offered by the local police. As Joe digs deeper into the murders, he soon discovers that the outfitter brought more than death to his backdoor: he brought Joe an endangered species, thought to be extinct, which is now living in his woodpile. But if word of the existence of this endangered species gets out, it will destroy any chance of InterWest, a multi-national natural gas company, building an oil pipeline that would bring the company billions of dollars across Wyoming, through the mountains and forests of Twelve Sleep.

His influence has spanned decades, but that influence has become so much a part of mainstream psychology that the ingenious nature of his work has almost been forgotten. A new introduction by Peter Kramer sheds light on the significance of Dr. Rogers's work today. New discoveries in the field of psychopharmacology, especially that of the antidepressant Prozac, have spawned a quick-fix drug revolution that has obscured the psychotherapeutic relationship.

Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'Psychology', 'War', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Germany', 'European History', 'Military Fiction']","Christopher R. Browning’s shocking account of how a unit of average middle-aged Germans became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews—now with a new afterword and additional photographs. Ordinary Men is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of  RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition.  Ordinary Men is a powerful, chilling, and important work, with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.  ",,,02/01/92,April 6th 1993,[],Paperback,,9780060995065,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387867571l/647492.jpg,4.1,['National Jewish Book Award for Holocaust (1994)'],193.0,2.0,,,,96.0,11583.0,271,Harper Perennial,"['4304', '4710', '2077', '383', '109']",,[],,['Christopher R.

Kirsch, who was one of Langdon’s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence. As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret. Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace itself . . . and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch.

How do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division actually work? What are geometry and logic? As he delves into these subjects, he discovers and lucidly describes the beauty and complexity behind their seemingly simple exteriors, making clear how and why these mercurial, often slippery concepts are essential to who we are. Filled with illuminating historical anecdotes and asides on some of the most fascinating mathematicians through the ages, One, Two, Three is a captivating exploration of the foundation of mathematics: how it originated, who thought of it, and why it matters.",,,01/01/11,May 10th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780375423338,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320499621l/10349694.jpg,3.17,[],87.0,1.0,,,,70.0,187.0,224,Pantheon,"['26', '45', '59', '48', '9']",,[],,['David Berlinski']

With heart, humor and compassion, this debut work of women's fiction is certain to stir anyone who relishes a good laugh, can stand a good cry, and, above all believes in the redemptive power of love.This unique, contemporary story gives readers a dual perspective. Sydney Shephard, a sweet-tempered, strong-natured college senior is young, in love with an exceptional man, and unexpectedly pregnant. Faced with a child she never planned for, she is forced to relay this news to her neurotic mother, relinquish her youth, and risk losing the love of her life. Then there's Grace, a daughter, who believed she was a product of this great love, grows to realize her existence is not what she assumed, and is left with profound and puzzling questions about who she really is.Spanning generations and every imaginable emotion, One Pink Line reveals how two points of view can be dramatically at odds, and perhaps ultimately reconciled. Simultaneously deeply felt and lighthearted, One Pink Line deftly mines how the choices we make are able to alter so many lives, and how doing the right thing and living honestly can bring unexpected, hard-won happiness.

Old Hickory Lane,,[],"Think ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" but with a plot, some mystery, and maybe a ghost. Set in a near future 'now' and marked by moment-to-moment, life-and-death crises that are a practicing veterinarian's life, meet Warren Jeffreys, DVM. Raised white, half Cree, he's gifted with animals, but not very people savvy. Struggling to survive his first year in private practice, despite the huge chip on his shoulder, college debt, and a plague of bigotry and prejudice, his bad luck and worse judgment lands him broke and homeless, camping out with vagrants and vagabonds. He's cleansing cows and cutting up dead lambs inside bawling ewes—an animal mechanic working for a small-time veterinary service in rural North Idaho. As his hopes for prestige and preeminence buckle under the rigors of day-to-day practice, he finds a new dream—a reconciliation to home and family—and with it comes a certain peace…until, once again, as fame and fortune tempt, he faces hard choices. Filled with intense, critical emergencies, all of them based on true cases, the book has been “vetted” by modern, practicing veterinarians. It's the animals that make you really pull for Dr. Warren Jeffreys, because, despite his best attempts not to, he cares. A lot. And, because he cares, because he competes against death, regardless the odds, he makes a difference. Unfortunately, the often cantankerous farm folk he serves don’t always appreciate his efforts and skill. Nor do they trust him, the ""too tall, long-haired Injun.""

Orientalism,,History,"For generations now, Edward W. Said's Orientalism has defined our understanding of colonialism and empire, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a preface written by Said shortly before his death in 2003. In this highly-acclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for writers, philosophers and colonial administrators to deal with the 'otherness' of eastern culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative depictions have greatly contributed to the West's romantic and exotic picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a reflection of European imperialism and racism. Edward W. Said (1935-2003) was a Palestinian-American cultural critic and author, born in Jerusalem and educated in Egypt and the United States. His other books include The Question of Palestine, Culture and Imperialism and Out of Place: A Memoir.

Out of the Vinyl Deeps: On Rock Music,,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Pop Culture', 'Criticism', 'Art', 'Feminism', 'History', 'Journalism', 'Memoir']","In 1968, the New Yorker hired Ellen Willis as its first popular music critic. Her column, Rock, Etc., ran for seven years and established Willis as a leader in cultural commentary and a pioneer in the nascent and otherwise male-dominated field of rock criticism. As a writer for a magazine with a circulation of nearly half a million, Willis was also the country’s most widely read rock critic. With a voice at once sharp, thoughtful, and ecstatic, she covered a wide range of artists—Bob Dylan, The Who, Van Morrison, Elvis Presley, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Joni Mitchell, the Velvet Underground, Sam and Dave, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Wonder—assessing their albums and performances not only on their originality, musicianship, and cultural impact but also in terms of how they made her feel.Because Willis stopped writing about music in the early 1980s—when, she felt, rock ’n’ roll had lost its political edge—her significant contribution to the history and reception of rock music has been overshadowed by contemporary music critics like Robert Christgau, Lester Bangs, and Dave Marsh. Out of the Vinyl Deeps collects for the first time Willis’s Rock, Etc. columns and her other writings about popular music from this period (includingliner notes for works by Lou Reed and Janis Joplin) and reasserts her rightful place in rock music criticism.More than simply setting the record straight, Out of the Vinyl Deeps reintroduces Willis’s singular approach and style—her use of music to comment on broader social and political issues, critical acuity, vivid prose, against-the-grain opinions, and distinctly female (and feminist) perspective—to a new generation of readers. Featuring essays by the New Yorker’s current popular music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones, and cultural critics Daphne Carr and Evie Nagy, this volume also provides a lively and still relevant account of rock music during, arguably, its most innovative period.",,,04/06/11,May 1st 2011,[],Paperback,,9780816672837,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328809754l/9796196.jpg,3.95,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Criticism (2011)'],91.0,1.0,,,,93.0,829.0,234,Univ Of Minnesota Press,"['276', '315', '182', '33', '23']",,[],,"['Ellen Willis', 'Nona Willis-Aronowitz', 'Sasha Frere-Jones', 'Daphne Carr', 'Evie Nagy']"

One Writer's Beginnings,,"['Memoir', 'Writing', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Southern']","Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents.

In Orestes, the most popular of the tragedian's plays in the ancient world, Euripides explores theemotional consequences of Orestes' murder of his mother on the individuals concerned, and makes the tale resonate with advice to Athens about the threat to democracy posed by political pressure groups. The Suppliant Women is a commentary on the politics of empire, as the Athenian king Theseusdecides to use force of arms rather than persuasion against Thebes.

O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acção de Os Maias passa-se em Lisboa, na segunda metade do século XIX, e apresenta-nos a história de três gerações da família Maia. A acção inicia-se no Outono de 1875, quando Afonso da Maia, nobre e pobre proprietário, se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recém formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descrição da casa - ""O Ramalhete,"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassóis, e não em algo fresco ou campestre, tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpático do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou, pois não se lhe conhecem defeitos. É um homem de carácter, culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. Após o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exílio por razões de ordem política. Há em Os Maias um retrato da Lisboa da epóca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequência até ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vá a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. É possível seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio Público, e que é descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o país uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa Olávia...), é tudo uma choldra ignóbil. Predomina uma visão de estrangeirado, de quem só valoriza as civilizações superiores - da França e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os políticos são mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boémios e dissolutos, retrógrados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boémios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto não conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois não há hipódromo à altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas não vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cúmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda há alguma esperanca implícita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e João da Ega dizem que o apetite humano é a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terão apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes está a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa não leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas começam a correr para apanhar o americano (eléctrico). Mais do que crítica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um país - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde A Cidade e as Serras, expõe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raízes rurais ancestrais não atingidas pela degradação da civilização, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'Os Maias.",,,10/28/88,April 2003,"['Carlos da Maia', 'João da Ega', 'Maria Eduarda', 'Afonso da Maia', 'Maria Monforte', 'Eusébiozinho', 'Alencar', 'Conde de Gouvarinho', 'Sousa Neto', 'Palma Cavalão', 'Dâmaso Salcede', 'Steinbroken', 'Cohen', 'Craft', 'Condessa de Gouvarinho', 'Cruges', 'Tancredo', 'Sr. Guimarães', 'Rufino']",Paperback,,9789725681367,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg,4.02,"['PEN Translation Prize for Margaret Jull Costa (2008)', 'Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2008)']",2584.0,30.0,,,,93.0,17143.0,681,Verbo,"['6235', '6476', '3205', '925', '302']",,[],,"['Eça de Queirós', 'Ester de Lemos']"

Initiated into these legends from childhood, little Ina asked too many questions but over time grew to be a woman who silently questioned the beliefs and customs of her people. Even though she avoided crisis at all costs, her life blazed from one crisis to another. Just when she finally finds reprieve, her sanctuary is broken. On her daughter’s fifteenth birthday, Ina discovers an exquisite shell by the sea shore. The same day, a stranger mysteriously arrives on island. Little did she know that this would herald the beginning of a harrowing threat to a secret island life as it had existed for centuries and lead to unprecedented turmoil for her family. Faced with what seems like insurmountable challenges as a mother and grandmother, Ina must make a heart wrenching choice in order to comply with tradition. Consumed by guilt, self-loathing and pain, she transforms into a rebel…. ----------------------------------------------------------------“Your granddaughter has to go, so we can have peace here.” Ina knew the only way people, dead or alive, left the island.

On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Essays', 'Theory', 'School', 'Germany', '19th Century']","Forward ""Incidentally, I despise everything which merely instructs me without increasing or immediately enlivening my activity."" These are Goethe's words. With them, as with a heartfelt expression of Ceterum censeo [I judge otherwise], our consideration of the worth and the worthlessness of history may begin. For this work is to set down why, in the spirit of Goethe's saying, we must seriously despise instruction without vitality, knowledge which enervates activity, and history as an expensive surplus of knowledge and a luxury, because we lack what is still most essential to us and because what is superfluous is hostile to what is essential. To be sure, we need history. But we need it in a manner different from the way in which the spoilt idler in the garden of knowledge uses it, no matter how elegantly he may look down on our coarse and graceless needs and distresses. That is, we need it for life and action, not for a comfortable turning away from life and action or merely for glossing over the egotistical life and the cowardly bad act. We wish to use history only insofar as it serves living. But there is a degree of doing history and a valuing of it through which life atrophies and degenerates. To bring this phenomenon to light as a remarkable symptom of our time is every bit as necessary as it may be painful. I have tried to describe a feeling which has often enough tormented me. I take my revenge on this feeling when I expose it to the general public. Perhaps with such a description someone or other will have reason to point out to me that he also knows this particular sensation but that I have not felt it with sufficient purity and naturalness and definitely have not expressed myself with the appropriate certainty and mature experience. Perhaps one or two will respond in this way. However, most people will tell me that this feeling is totally wrong, unnatural, abominable, and absolutely forbidden, that with it, in fact, I have shown myself unworthy of the powerful historical tendency of the times, as it has been, by common knowledge, observed for the past two generations, particularly among the Germans. Whatever the reaction, now that I dare to expose myself with this natural description of my feeling, common decency will be fostered rather than shamed, because I am providing many opportunities for a contemporary tendency like the reaction just mentioned to make polite pronouncements. Moreover, I obtain for myself something of even more value to me than respectability: I become publicly instructed and set straight about our times.  This essay is also out of touch with the times because here I am trying for once to see as a contemporary disgrace, infirmity, and defect something of which our age is justifiably proud, its historical culture. For I believe, in fact, that we are all suffering from a consumptive historical fever and at the very least should recognize that we are afflicted with it. If Goethe with good reason said that with our virtues we simultaneously cultivate our faults and if, as everyone knows, a hypertrophic virtue (as the historical sense of our age appears to me to be) can serve to destroy a people just as well as a hypertrophic vice, then people may make allowance for me this once. Also in my defence I should not conceal the fact that the experiences which aroused these feelings of torment in me I have derived for the most part from myself and only from others for the purpose of comparison and that, insofar as I am a student more of ancient times, particularly the Greeks, I come as a child in these present times to such anachronistic experiences concerning myself....",,,04/01/74,May 17th 2008,[],Kindle Edition,,9780915144945,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385450228l/18957343.jpg,3.95,[],94.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1775.0,78,Oak Grove,"['607', '645', '396', '87', '40']",,[],,['Friedrich Nietzsche']
On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Essays', 'German Literature', 'Theory', 'Germany', '19th Century', 'Psychology', 'Read For School']","""On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense"") is an (initially) unpublished work of Friedrich Nietzsche written in 1873, one year after The Birth of Tragedy. It deals largely with epistemological questions of truth and language, including the formation of concepts. Every word immediately becomes a concept, inasmuch as it is not intended to serve as a reminder of the unique and wholly individualized original experience to which it owes its birth, but must at the same time fit innumerable, more or less similar cases—which means, strictly speaking, never equal—in other words, a lot of unequal cases. Every concept originates through our equating what is unequal. According to Paul F. Glenn, Nietzsche is arguing that ""concepts are metaphors which do not correspond to reality."" Although all concepts are human inventions (created by common agreement to facilitate ease of communication), human beings forget this fact after inventing them, and come to believe that they are ""true"" and do correspond to reality. Thus Nietzsche argues that ""truth"" is actually: A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins. These ideas about truth and its relation to human language have been particularly influential among postmodern theorists, and ""On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense"" is one of the works most responsible for Nietzsche's reputation (albeit a contentious one) as ""the godfather of postmodernism.""",,,,1873,[],,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357800762l/17229241.jpg,4.26,[],99.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1089.0,8,,"['523', '375', '145', '39', '7']",,[],,['Friedrich Nietzsche']

Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns.

One Hundred Years of Solitude,,Fiction,"One of the 20th century's enduring works, One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.

In One Man's Bible, Gao gives us a profound meditation on a life marked by personal and political trauma. The nameless narrator of the novel -- which begins in contemporary Hong Kong -- is clearly Gao himself. In the intimate aftermath of a sexual encounter, Gao revisits the central moments of his life, traveling, in memory, to the Beijing of his childhood, a childhood scarred at the age of ten by his mother's accidental drowning. From emblematic moments like this, Gao's memory ranges across time and space, gradually illuminating the nature of life before, during, and after China's disastrous Cultural Revolution. Gao Xingjian is one of the most eloquent, authoritative voices of 20th-century China, and his personal, political, and aesthetic musings shine a light on a world that very few Westerners have ever truly understood.

The Babywise Parent Directed Feeding concept has enough structure to bring security and order to your baby's world, yet enough flexibility to give mom freedom to respond to any need at any time. It teaches parents how to lovingly guide their baby's day rather than be guided or enslaved to the infant's unknown needs. The information contained within On Becoming Babywise is loaded with success. Comprehensive breast-feeding follow-up surveys spanning three countries, of mothers using the PDF method verify that as a result of the PDF concepts, 88% breast-feed, compared to the national average of only 54% (from the National Center for Health Statistics). Of these breast-feeding mothers, 80% of them breast-feed exclusively without a formula complement. And while 70% of our mothers are still breast-feeding after six months, the national average encourage to follow demand feeding without any guidelines is only 20%. The mean average time of breast-feeding for PDF moms is 33 1/2 weeks, well above the national average. Over 50% of PDF mothers extend their breast-feeding toward and well into the first year. Added to these statistics is another critical factor. The average breast-fed PDF baby sleeps continuously through night seven to eight hours between weeks seven and nine. Healthy sleep in infants is analogous to healthy growth and development.

On Bullshit,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Humor', 'Language', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural']","One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, ""we have no theory.""Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.",,,11/06/86,January 30th 2005,[],Hardcover,,9780691122946,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393606915l/385.jpg,3.58,[],92.0,1.0,,,,86.0,10803.0,74,Princeton University Press,"['2332', '3491', '3427', '1210', '343']",,[],,['Harry G.

"On the Nature of Consciousness: Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives",,[],"This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuropsychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various ""new age"" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.",,,11/06/95,August 30th 1995,[],Hardcover,,9780300062304,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328870950l/813603.jpg,4.2,[],52.0,1.0,,,,90.0,10.0,384,Yale University Press,"['6', '1', '2', '1', '0']",,[],,['Harry T.

Pisarz, starając się wzbudzić w czytelnikach patriotyczne uczucia, nadał powieści cechy antycznego i rycerskiego eposu, wprowadził baśniowość oraz wyraźny podział na bohaterów reprezentujących dobro i zło. Jednoznacznie negatywną kwalifikację moralną przypisał Sienkiewicz zbuntowanym Kozakom, przedstawionym jako żądni krwi barbarzyńcy, zaś Polaków przedstawił jako odważnych obrońców ojczyzny i prawych, przestrzegających rycerskiego kodeksu żołnierzy. W czarno-biały schemat wpisani zostali także – wbrew prawdzie historycznej – przywódcy walczących stron. Głównym wątkiem spajającym fabułę pierwszej części Trylogii uczynił pisarz burzliwe dzieje miłości odważnego rycerza bez skazy – Jana Skrzetuskiego i urodziwej, niewinnej szlachcianki – Heleny Kurcewiczówny, którzy rozdzieleni przez wrogów i przeciwności losu, przeżywają liczne perypetie. Uwolnienie dziewczyny przez Zagłobę i ich wędrówka w przebraniu, ponowne wpadnięcie w ręce Bohuna..., wszystkie te przygody prowadzą do szczęśliwego zakończenia, w którym bohaterowie spotykają się i mogą stanąć na ślubnym kobiercu...",The Trilogy - 3 book edition #1,,10/30/84,2007,"['Bohun', 'Helena Kurcewiczówna', 'Jan Skrzetuski', 'Michał Wołodyjowski', 'Jan Zagłoba', 'Longinus Podbipięta', 'Rzędzian', 'Horpyna', 'Jan Kazimierz', 'Jeremi Wiśniowiecki', 'Bohdan Chmielnicki']",,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1190098895l/1904724.jpg,3.99,[],145.0,2.0,,,,91.0,4442.0,528,Zielona Sowa,"['1703', '1509', '822', '280', '128']",,[],,['Henryk Sienkiewicz']

Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity. While, as ever at the centre of everything, a thief in a red waistcoat and of rotund proportions walks the streets, juggling in one hand custard pastries, and in the other the fate of the city itself. Far to the south, fragments of the titanic Moon's Spawn have crashed into the Rivan Sea creating a series of isles... and a fortune hunter's dream. A Malazan veteran calling himself 'Red' ventures out to try his luck -- and perhaps say goodbye to old friends. But there he finds far more than he'd bargained for as the rush to claim the Spawn's treasures descends into a mad scramble of chaos and bloodshed. For powers from across the world have gathered here, searching for the legendary Throne of Night. The impact of these events are far reaching, it seems. On an unremarkable island off the coast of Genabackis, a people who had turned their backs upon all such strivings now lift their masked faces towards the mainland and recall the ancient prophesy of a return. And what about the ex-Claw of the Malazan Empire who now walks the uttermost edge of creation?

Crazy Horse, perhaps the greatest Indian war leader of the 1800s, and Black Elk, the holy man whose teachings achieved worldwide renown, were Oglala; in these typically perceptive pages, Frazier seeks out their descendants on Pine Ridge—a/k/a ""the rez""—which is one of the poorest places in America today. Along with his longtime friend Le War Lance (whom he first wrote about in his 1989 bestseller, Great Plains) and other Oglala companions, Frazier fully explores the rez as they visit friends and relatives, go to pow-wows and rodeos and package stores, and tinker with a variety of falling-apart cars. He takes us inside the world of the Sioux as few writers ever have, writing with much wit, compassion, and imagination. In the career of SuAnne Big Crow, for example, the most admired Oglala basketball player of all time, who died in a car accident in 1992, Frazier finds a contemporary reemergence of the death-defying, public-spirited Sioux hero who fights with grace and glory to save her followers.

Overcoming Assumptions That Inhibit Spiritual Development,,[],"This CD set is a recording of a live lecture, delivered in 1976. Shah addresses the nature of assumptions, those that inhibit understanding and those that might be useful at certain stages of study but need to be set aside by the student at a later time in order to progress. This requires a flexibility of approach that is not customary in the West, one cultivated by study and exposure to Sufi ideas. Its a very humorous and lively lecture, full of stories and anecdotes. Among the other topics Shah addresses are the difference between emotionality and spirituality, the danger of looking for easy answers, and the way in which the paths of East and West are converging.

Behind the distortions and grotesqueries of magical practices, could there be clues to processes worthy of our objective consideration?

Its publication was the culmination of five years of research into rare artifacts, obscure manuscripts and travels into remote areas where strange magical practices endure. The ""Singing Sands"" of Egypt, the invisible rulership of Sufism, subcutaneous electricity, and the prehistoric sources of Babylonian occult practices are just a few of the intriguing subjects described. The author includes personal accounts of ""training"" under a Ju-Ju witch doctor, a demonstration of Hindu levitation, and translations of secret alchemical and magical formulae. Revealed is an astonishing similarity in magical beliefs, practices and terminology of places as diverse as China, the Near East, Scandinavia and Africa. ""Oriental Magic"" includes a myriad of illustrations, including unique photos of places and people associated with the mysterious world of magic.

On Hitler's Mountain: Overcoming the Legacy of a Nazi Childhood,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'Germany', 'Autobiography', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir']","A powerful and riveting account of a seemingly halcyon life lived mere paces from a center of evil and madness; a remarkable memoir of an ""ordinary"" childhood spent in an extraordinary time and place.On Hitler's Mountain is a powerful, intimate, riveting, and revealing account of a seemingly halcyon life lived mere paces from a center of evil and madness; a remarkable memoir of an ""ordinary"" childhood spent in an extraordinary time and place.Born in 1934, Irmgard Hunt grew up in the picturesque Bavarian village of Berchtesgaden, in the shadow of the Eagle's Nest and near Adolf Hitler's luxurious alpine retreat. The very model of blond Aryan ""purity,"" Irmgard sat on the Führer's knee for photographers, witnessed with excitement the comings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so eagerly embraced. Here, in a picture-postcard world untouched by the war and seemingly unblemished by the horrors Germany's master had wrought, she accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and joyfully sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.But before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the ""truths"" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, often feeling lonely in her quest, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for an almost unbearable reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her commitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.Provocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's On Hitler's Mountain offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.",,,03/01/05,January 31st 2006,[],Paperback,,9780060532185,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407708176l/54330.jpg,3.95,[],48.0,1.0,,,,95.0,3118.0,278,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['903', '1339', '723', '119', '34']",,[],,['Irmgard A.

The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia's nineteenth century landed gentry. Oblomov's distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. While a common negative characteristic, Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business apathetically from his bed. While clearly comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century.

On the Road: the Original Scroll,,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Travel', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Adventure', 'Modern Classics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook']","The legendary 1951 scroll draft of On the Road, published word for word as Kerouac originally composed it  Though Jack Kerouac began thinking about the novel that was to become On the Road as early as 1947, it was not until three weeks in April 1951, in an apartment on West Twentieth Street in Manhattan, that he wrote the first full draft that was satisfactory to him. Typed out as one long, single-spaced paragraph on eight long sheets of tracing paper that he later taped together to form a 120 foot scroll, this document is among the most significant, celebrated, and provocative artifacts in contemporary American literary history. It represents the first full expression of Kerouac’s revolutionary aesthetic, the identifiable point at which his thematic vision and narrative voice came together in a sustained burst of creative energy. It was also part of a wider vital experimentation in the American literary, musical, and visual arts in the post-World War II period.  It was not until more than six years later, and several new drafts, that Viking published, in 1957, the novel known to us today. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of On the Road, Viking will publish the 1951 scroll in a standard book format. The differences between the two versions are principally ones of significant detail and altered emphasis. The scroll is slightly longer and has a heightened linguistic virtuosity and a more sexually frenetic tone. It also uses the real names of Kerouac’s friends instead of the fictional names he later invented for them. The transcription of the scroll was done by Howard Cunnell who, along with Joshua Kupetz, George Mouratidis, and Penny Vlagopoulos, provides a critical introduction that explains the fascinating compositional and publication history of On the Road and anchors the text in its historical, political, and social context.",,,10/28/57,August 16th 2007,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429331743l/417065.jpg,4.13,[],281.0,3.0,,,,92.0,10542.0,416,Viking,"['4976', '3089', '1609', '611', '257']",,[],,"['Jack Kerouac', 'Joshua Kupetz', 'George Mouratidis', 'Penny Vlagopoulos']"

It is, first of all, an autobiography the like of which has seldom been.”The son of a seafaring father, Richard Julius Herman Krebs, a.k.a. Jan Valtin, came of age as a bicycle messenger during a maritime rebellion. His life as an intimate insider account of the dramatic events of 1920’s and 1930s, where he rose both within the ranks of the Communist Party and on the Gestapo hit list. Known for his honesty and incredible memory, Krebs dedicated his life to the Communist Party, rising to a position as head of maritime, organizing worldwide for the Comintern, only to flee the Party and Europe to evade his own comrade’s attempts to kill him. As a professional revolutionary, agitator, spy and would-be assassin, Krebs traveled the globe from Germany to China, India to Sierra Leon, Moscow to the United States where a botched assassination attempt landed him a stint in San Quentin.From his spellbinding account of artful deception to gain release from a Nazi prison and his work as a double-agent within the Gestapo, to his vivid depiction of a Communist Party fraught with intrigue and subterfuge, Krebs gives an unflinching portrayal of the internal machinations of both parties.Writing at age 36 under the name Jan Valtin, Krebs lays bare a young life filled with idealism and devotion—disillusionment and loss—in a world full of revolutionary promise gone immeasurably wrong.”An exciting, real book without a trace of unnecessary melodrama.”—H.G.Wells",,,11/05/40,May 1st 2004,[],Paperback,,9781902593869,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328696857l/171351.jpg,4.51,[],94.0,1.0,,,,97.0,218.0,720,AK Press,"['146', '45', '21', '4', '2']",,[],,"['Jan Valtin', 'Bruce Anderson']"

Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Literary Fiction', 'Essays', 'Collections', 'History', 'American History', 'Literature', 'Classics']","In 2008, Barack Obama lobotomized a generation. For an entire year, otherwise clear-thinking members of the most affluent, over-educated, information-drenched generation in American history fell prey to the most expensive, hi-tech, laser-focused marketing assault in presidential campaign history. Twitter messages were machine-gunned to cell phones at mach speed. Facebook and MySpace groups spread across the Internet like digital fire. YouTube videos featuring celebrities ricocheted across the globe and into college students’ in-boxes with devastating regularity. All the while, the mega-money-raising engine whirred like a slot machine stuck on jackpot. The result: an unthinking mass of young voters marched forward to elect the most radical and untested president in U.S. history. Recognized as one of the country’s top young conservative activists by Human Events, Jason Mattera created an internet sensation with ambush video interviews that exposed clueless young liberals and cunning Democratic officials. Now he reveals the jaw-dropping lengths Barack Obama and his allies in Hollywood, Washington, and Academia went to in order to transform a legion of iPod-listening, MTV-watching followers into a winning coalition that threatens to become a long-lasting political realignment. Obama Zombies uncovers the true, behind-the-scenes story of the methods and tactics the Obama campaign unleashed on youth culture. Through personal interviews and meticulous original research, Mattera explains why conservatism’s future rests upon jolting the young masses from their slumber, yanking out their earphones, and sparking a countercultural conservative battle against the rise of the ignorant Left. The lesson from 2008 is crystal clear: When true conservatives run away, Obama zombies come out to play.",,,01/11/10,March 23rd 2010,"['Barack Obama', 'Zombies']",Hardcover,,9781439172070,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347667194l/6665900.jpg,3.49,[],193.0,2.0,,,,79.0,545.0,288,Threshold Editions,"['149', '142', '140', '53', '61']",,[],,['Jason Mattera']

Our Story: 77 Hours That Tested Our Friendship and Our Faith,,['Nonfiction'],"The entire nation stopped and held its collective breath as word spread of the plight of the nine Pennsylvania coal miners who were trapped underground for 77 hours. Now, for the first time, the miners tell their own story--in a dramatic, riveting first-person account of their actions and emotions and of how they managed to make it through the traumatic accident and rescue. The men were below ground when water trapped in an adjacent mine burst through the wall of the new mine they were working. Scrambling to avoid the sluicing tide that rapidly rose in the narrow passageway, the crew knew they were in serious trouble. Moe, who was trapped on the other side of the raging stream, alone and away from the others, thought he would die then and there. However, in a heroic effort, Randly Fogle, crew chief, drove the scoop machinery straight into the flood and Moe managed to leap into it, and thus was carried to relative safety. Now all together, the miners moved to the best location they could find in the freezing-cold, still-rising water. They recount their fears, their prayers, their confessions to one another, and how they kept up their hope that they'd get out alive, while trying to decide how to drown with dignity. Meanwhile, we see the agony their wives, girlfriends, and families were going through, not knowing if they were living or dead. Once a resuce was imminent, the men reveal how they decided who would be the last man up. And they tell of their emotions upon finally touching solid ground and meeting their loved ones, whom they'd thought they would never see again. The successful rescue of the miners lifted the spirits of an entire nation. Now everyone can read the complete story of this harrowing incident--how these men and their families had the strength, courage, and faith to endure their incredible ordeal.",,,,November 13th 2002,[],Hardcover,,9781401300555,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347365478l/1008856.jpg,3.84,[],92.0,1.0,,,,97.0,101.0,192,Kingswell,"['24', '41', '33', '2', '1']",,[],,['Jeff Goodell']

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, On Intelligence promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age.

He points out that the voice of fear makes the mind dull and insensitive, and argues that the roots of hidden fears, which limit us and from which we constantly seek escape, cannot be discovered through analysis of the past.

This includes honoring Grandma's surprising wish to have her ashes scattered in Scotland.""We were two fat women, eighteen years apart, a chair artist and a designer of Christmas ornaments, who only knew we had troubles and a hot summer to get through,"" says Sarah. But as it turns out, there is a great deal more to quirky Aunt Edna's troubles than Sarah could possibly imagine. As the novel turns from the hot, oppressive heat of Texas to the misty beauty of Scotland, she learns of her aunt's remarkable secret life and comes to fully understand the fragile business of living, and even of dying.Praised for his richly drawn characters and as a master storyteller, Joe Coomer is at the height of his powers in One Vacant Chair.Winner of the S.

She has a first-kiss tree and a broken-arm tree. She has a car-accident tree. There is a tree at the hospital where Jackie’s mother passed away into the long good night. When one of them gets cut down, Jackie doesn’t know what to do but she doesn’t let that stop her. She picks up the biggest rock she can carry and puts it through the window of a car. Smash. She intends to leave before the police arrive, but they’re early. Ann is Jackie’s best friend, but she’s got problems of her own. Her mother is chained up in the basement. How do you bring that up in casual conversation? “Oh, sorry I’ve been so distant, Jackie. My mother has more teeth than she’s supposed to, and she won’t eat anything that’s already dead.” Ann and her sister Margaret don’t have much of a choice here. Their mother needs to be fed. It isn’t easy but this is family. It’s not supposed to be easy. It’ll be okay as long as Margaret and Ann still have each other. Add in a cantankerous old man, his powerfully stupid dog, a headless ghost, a lesbian crush and a few unsettling visits from Jackie’s own dead mother, and you’ll find that One Bloody Thing After Another is a different sort of horror novel from the ones you’re used to. It’s as sad and funny as it is frightening, and it is as much about the way families rely on each other as it is about blood being drooled on the carpet.

Ali, por quase três anos, irá testemunhar, do olho do furacão, eventos que alteraram por completo os rumos da história do século XX. Pode-se fugir da história? Será possível viver no anonimato após uma existência de fausto e glória? A vida comum é assim tão diferente da vida pública? Geórgui Jachmenev passou a vida inteira se debatendo com essas questões, e agora, prestes a perder o grande amor de sua vida, tenta encontrar uma resposta para elas ao refletir sobre seu percurso num século XX que sempre lhe pareceu longo demais. Seus feitos começaram cedo: aos dezesseis anos, em ação impulsiva e atabalhoada, o rapaz impediu um atentado contra a vida de ninguém menos que o grão-duque Nicolau Nicolaievitch, irmão do czar Nicolau II, que, agradecido, nomeou Geórgui o guarda-costas oficial de seu filho Alexei, destinado a ser o próximo czar. Uma reviravolta impressionante, que o levou da taiga russa para o fausto dos palácios moscovitas, cenário que, apesar da amplidão e luxo de seus imensos corredores, iria se revelar bem mais inóspito que os frios grotões de sua vida anterior. A dura experiência com esse mundo gélido de intrigas palacianas, às quais sempre era jogado contra sua vontade, e de grandes tensões e responsabilidade só foi apaziguada com a chegada do primeiro amor, Zoia. Mas os tempos eram agitados, e a história deixou pouco espaço para idílios: quando a Revolução Bolchevique tomou de assalto o país, e isolou toda a família doczar numa casa de campo nos arredores de Ekaterinburg, mais uma vez Geórgui teve de agir rápido a fim de salvar a si e a Zoia. A vida com ela lhe custaria pátria, família e prestígio, e ele jamais se arrependeu disso - mas e para Zoia, o que teria custado? Numa narrativa fascinante, em que presente e passado vão convergindo em capítulos alternados, da Inglaterra dos anos Thatcher para a época dos czares russos, e dos anos difícies da segunda Guerra Mundial para o turbilhão da Revolução Bolchevique, acompanhamos Geórgui em meio a acontecimentos históricos decisivos que acabam por se revelar mero pano de fundo para uma história de amor que esconde um grande mistério, talvez maior que a própria história.",,,05/15/09,August 13th 2010,"['Georgy Danillovich Jachmenev', 'Zoya Jachmenev', 'Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich', 'Grand Duchess Anastasia Fedorovna Romanov', 'Grand Duchess Maria Fedorovna Romanov', 'Grand Duchess Tatiana Fedorovna Romanov', 'Grand Duchess Olga Fedorovna Romanov', 'Empress Alexandra Feodorovna', 'Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia']",Paperback,,9788535917109,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1285693791l/9412215.jpg,4.11,[],197.0,2.0,,,,95.0,7779.0,456,Companhia das Letras,"['3051', '2999', '1350', '276', '103']",,"['London, England', 'Paris (France)', 'Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)']",,"['John Boyne', 'Denise Bottmann']"

On Moral Fiction,,"['Writing', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Literary Criticism', 'Criticism', 'Reference', 'Literature', 'Books About Books', 'Art', 'Crafts']","On Moral Fiction set off a firestorm of controversy when it was first published in 1978. With a daring not obscured by the author’s extraordinary humaneness of spirit, the book argued that contemporary literature suffers first and foremost from a basic failure of the test of “morality.” By “moral fiction” the author meant fiction that attempts to test human values, not for the purpose of preaching or peddling a particular ideology or mode of conduct, but in a honest and open-minded effort to find out what best promotes human fulfillment. Such writing does so, as great artists beginning with Homer have always known, by the kind of analysis of characters and actions that brings both the writer and the reader to a fuller understanding, sympathy, and vision of human possibility. Because so much contemporary fiction fails to be moral in this sense, John Gardner argued, it undermines our experience of literature and our faith in ourselves. This bold argument is driven forward as the author subjects the work of his most celebrated contemporaries, such as Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, John Updike, and Donald Barthelme to his sharp-eyed and relentless analysis. Although the last three decades have seen the rise of new generations of writers, and the ascendancy of postmodern modes of composition, On Moral Fiction still sets out the terms of a more ancient sense of the novelist’s calling. It is a salutary counterweight to prevailing trends. Praise for On Moral Fiction:  “On Moral Fiction is criticism with both eyes open, fearless, illuminating, proving that the concern of thecritic is with art, that true art is moral and not trivial, that it and the discussion of it can give pleasure—of a sort that lasts and re-echoes.”— Robert Kirsch, Los Angeles Times “Because Gardner’s anger is honest and wholesome, the criticism of his contemporaries never descends to mere vindictiveness or gossip.”—Max Apple, The Nation  “A thoughtful, amusing and arrogant little book, designed to pick fights.""—Webster Schott, The Washington Post Book World",,,11/06/78,June 25th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9781435107786,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1267351157l/7245795.jpg,3.83,[],93.0,1.0,,,,89.0,687.0,216,Barnes & Noble,"['199', '261', '152', '59', '16']",,[],,['John Gardner']

With elegance, humor, and sophistication, Gardner describes the life of a working novelist; warns what needs to be guarded against, both from within the writer and from without; and predicts what the writer can reasonably expect and what, in general, he or she cannot. ""For a certain kind of person,"" Gardner writes, ""nothing is more joyful or satisfying than the life of a novelist."" But no other vocation, he is quick to add, is so fraught with professional and spiritual difficulties. Whether discussing the supposed value of writer's workshops, explaining the role of the novelist's agent and editor, or railing against the seductive fruits of literary elitism, On Becoming a Novelist is an indispensable, life-affirming handbook for anyone authentically called to the profession.

After he locks Sally up in her room with the trashy ""blockbuster"" novel that has consumed her (and only apples to eat), the novel-within-the-novel becomes an echo chamber providing glimpses into the history of the family that spawned these bizarre, sad, and stubborn people.

Old Testament Theology for Christians: From Ancient Context to Enduring Belief,,"['Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Old Testament']","Modern readers of the Bible often find the Old Testament difficult and even disturbing. What are we to do with obscure prophecies of long expired nations? Why should we read and study ancient laws that even the New Testament says are eclipsed by Christ? How can we reconcile Jesus' Sermon on the Mount with the Old Testament's graphic narratives of sex and violence? What does the Old Testament offer that is not surpassed and even made irrelevant by the New Testament? John Walton has spent a career engaging deeply with the Old Testament's text and ancient context. He has studied, taught, and written about the issues. His signature approach can be introduced in one sentence: The Old Testament was written for us but not to us. We must not conform it to our own understanding. We will fully grasp the Old Testament and its theology only when we are immersed in the ancient cultural current of Israel within its broader cultural river of the ancient Near East. In Old Testament Theology for Christians, John Walton invites us to leave our modern--and even inherited Christian--preconceptions at the threshold as we enter the world of the Old Testament. He challenges us to see it anew--as if for the first time--as guests in a strange and fascinating foreign land. Then we will rediscover its testimony to God's great enterprise. In this capstone to a career of studying and teaching the Old Testament, Walton unfolds a grand panorama of Yahweh and the gods, of cosmos and humanity, of covenant and kingdom, of temple and torah, of sin and evil, and of salvation and afterlife. Viewed within its ancient Near Eastern cognitive environment, the text takes unexpected turns and blossoms into fresh and challenging insights. No matter how you are accustomed to viewing the first testament of the Bible, Old Testament Theology for Christians will challenge and sharpen your perceptions.",,,,November 21st 2017,[],Hardcover,,9780830851928,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1508362495l/36436636._SY475_.jpg,4.24,[],64.0,1.0,,,,97.0,68.0,320,IVP Academic,"['29', '28', '9', '2', '0']",,[],,['John H.

Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold History of English,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Audiobook', 'Science', 'Historical', 'Writing', 'Microhistory', 'Reference']","A survey of the quirks and quandaries of the English language, focusing on our strange and wonderful grammar Why do we say ""I am reading a catalog"" instead of ""I read a catalog""? Why do we say ""do"" at all? Is the way we speak a reflection of our cultural values? Delving into these provocative topics and more, Our Magnificent Bastard Language distills hundreds of years of fascinating lore into one lively history. Covering such turning points as the little-known Celtic and Welsh influences on English, the impact of the Viking raids and the Norman Conquest, and the Germanic invasions that started it all during the fifth century ad, John McWhorter narrates this colorful evolution with vigor. Drawing on revolutionary genetic and linguistic research as well as a cache of remarkable trivia about the origins of English words and syntax patterns, Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue ultimately demonstrates the arbitrary, maddening nature of English--and its ironic simplicity due to its role as a streamlined lingua franca during the early formation of Britain. This is the book that language aficionados worldwide have been waiting for (and no, it's not a sin to end a sentence with a preposition).",,,10/01/08,October 30th 2008,[],Paperback,,9781592403950,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441671846l/3143472._SY475_.jpg,3.79,[],86.0,1.0,,,,91.0,5759.0,230,Gotham Books,"['1471', '2251', '1512', '432', '93']",,[],,['John McWhorter']

First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect.

Stroud enters the minds of painters such as Goya, Brueghel, and Giotto Bondone, and he pays homage to the poets Blake, Milton, Smart, Lorca, Machado, and Jeffers....Many of the poems own a clarity that opens to unexpected emotional depths. One would be tempted to call them Zen poems because all have a quiet at the core, but they also love the surfaces.""—ForeWord""Reading Joseph Stroud's Of This World: New and Selected Poems, two words come to mind, namely 'breadth' and 'breath.' 'Breadth' because of his unerring command of odes, prose poems, sestets, etc....And 'breath' because of each poem's sure-footed movement....Make no mistake, however, these are not sleepy meditations that go up in incense smoke, but fleshy encounters, sensuous reveries, poems that are as much throbbing taproots as they are like that imaginary wingless bird that never lands, or, in other words, poems that flock as much as they flow."" —BookslutJoseph Stroud knows the value of taking one’s proper time to write poems, and taking great care when presenting a book to the world. Stroud has published four books in forty years, and his work has earned a devoted audience, including Jane Hirschfield, Ted Kooser, and Jim Harrison. Of This World includes the best from Stroud’s previous volumes, as well as a series of new poems and translations.The Georgia Review observed that “Joseph Stroud moves easily from the concise to the voluptuous.” He does this through various forms—compressed lyrics, longer narratives, odes, expansive prose poems. Informed by the qualities of clarity and compassion, and inspired by artists and writers as diverse as Li Po, Neruda, and Giotto, Stroud articulates a reverential attention to the world, and a commitment to revelations found beyond the self.Across the ravine from the mill house there’s a grassy patchwhere gypsies keep a donkey tied to a tree. SometimesI’ll cross the stream and bring him an apple, holding it outlike a rare jewel. He’ll contemplate it, then take my wholehand into his lips as soft as suede, and I can’t tell how hedoes it, but when his head lifts back, the apple has disappeared.Joseph Stroud is the recipient of the prestigious Witter Bynner Fellowship from the Library of Congress.

V Hamburku pracuje ve výzkumném centru spánku, sama však ne a ne usnout. A tak má po nocích spoustu času na vzpomínání: na to, jak před sedmnácti lety strávila jedno osudové léto v rodné vesnici Grund, obklopené rozvětveným tokem Rýna a hustými lesy.

(It's also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she's always wanted. Are you there, Oprah? It's me, Kathy.)Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, been nominated for a Grammy, worked and walked every red carpet known to man, and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy's sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit, the feisty comic settles a few old scores, celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top, and shares insider gossip about celebrity behavior–the good, the bad, and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or, in some cases, after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you've ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life, check the index for your name.Along the way, Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A., from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce, and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up, how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house, and which people in Kathy's life have taught her the most valuable lessons–both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn't enough, there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy's own collection–featuring the diva of the D List herself, with her old nose as well as her new one, plus celebrity friends, foes, frenemies, and hangers-on for you to gawk at.Refreshingly candid, unflinchingly honest, and full of hilarious ""Did she really say that?"" moments, Official Book Club Selection will make you laugh until you cry, or just puke up a little bit.",,,01/01/09,September 8th 2009,"['Kathy Griffin', 'Oprah', 'Andy Dick', 'Brooke Shields']",Hardcover,,9780345518514,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428806540l/6534932.jpg,3.79,[],84.0,1.0,,,,89.0,36605.0,348,Ballantine Books,"['11170', '12283', '9144', '2419', '1589']",,[],,['Kathy Griffin']

On the Reliability of the Old Testament,,"['History', 'Theology', 'Old Testament', 'Religion', 'Christian', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'Archaeology', 'Nonfiction']","For more than two hundred years controversy has raged over the reliability of the Old Testament. Questions about the factuality of its colorful stories of heroes, villains, and kings, for example, have led many critics to see the entire Hebrew Bible as little more than pious fiction. In this fascinating book, noted ancient historian K. A. Kitchen takes strong issue with today's ""revisionist"" critics and offers a firm foundation for the historicity of the biblical texts. In a detailed, comprehensive, and entertaining manner, Kitchen draws on an unprecedented range of historical data from the ancient Near East -- the Bible's own world -- and uses it to soundly reassess both the biblical record and the critics who condemn it. Working back from the latest periods (for which hard evidence is readily available) to the remotest times, Kitchen systematically shows up the many failures of favored arguments against the Bible and marshals pertinent permanent evidence from antiquity's inscriptions and artifacts to demonstrate the basic honesty of the Old Testament writers.  Enhanced with numerous tables, figures, and maps, On the Reliability of the Old Testament is a must-read for anyone interested in the question of biblical truth.",,,11/06/03,June 9th 2006,[],Paperback,,9780802803962,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348082957l/165002.jpg,4.32,[],71.0,1.0,,,,96.0,166.0,684,Eerdmans,"['88', '52', '19', '5', '2']",,[],,['Kenneth A.

Now the author of The Beekeeper's Apprentice and The Moor--the first writer since Patricia Cornwell to win both the American Edgar and British Creasey Awards for a debut novel (A Grave Talent)--unfolds a hitherto unknown chapter in the history of Russell's apprenticeship to the great detective.At the close of the year 1918, forced to flee England's green and pleasant land, Russell and Holmes enter British-occupied Palestine under the auspices of Holmes' enigmatic brother, Mycroft.""Gentlemen, we are at your service."" Thus Holmes greets the two travel-grimed Arab figures who receive them in the orange groves fringing the Holy Land. Whatever role could the volatile Ali and the taciturn Mahmoud play in Mycroft's design for this land the British so recently wrested from the Turks? After passing a series of tests, Holmes and Russell learn their guides are engaged in a mission for His Majesty's Government, and disguise themselves as Bedouins--Russell as the beardless youth ""Amir""--to join them in a stealthy reconnaissance through the dusty countryside.A recent rash of murders seems unrelated to the growing tensions between Jew, Moslem, and Christian, yet Holmes is adamant that he must reconstruct the most recent one in the desert gully where it occurred. His singular findings will lead him and Russell through labyrinthine bazaars, verminous inns, cliff-hung monasteries--and into mortal danger. When her mentor's inquiries jeopardize his life, Russell fearlessly wields a pistol and even assays the arts of seduction to save him. Bruised and bloodied, the pair ascend to the jewellike city of Jerusalem, where they will at last meet their adversary, whose lust for savagery and power could reduce the city's most ancient and sacred place to rubble and ignite this tinderbox of a land....Classically Holmesian yet enchantingly fresh, sinuously plotted, with colorful characters and a dazzling historic ambience, O Jerusalem sweeps readers ever onward in the thrill of the chase.From the Hardcover edition.",Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes #5,,10/28/99,June 28th 2000,"['Mary Russell', 'Ali Hazr', 'Mahmoud Hazr', 'Sherlock Holmes']",Paperback,,9780553581058,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388500747l/77259.jpg,4.14,[],255.0,4.0,,,,96.0,16552.0,425,Bantam Books,"['6665', '6351', '2906', '507', '123']",,"['Jerusalem (Israel)', 'Palestine']",,['Laurie R.

Drawn from Rand’s published works as well as in-depth conversations between her and Peikoff, these chapters illuminate Objectivism—and its creator—with startling clarity.

Abandoned by her mother as a child, mistreated by her father, and teased by her schoolmates (“Hey, Olive Oyl, where’s Popeye?”), the lonely girl finds solace in artistic pursuits. Only when she’s hired by the town’s sole feminist to work the night shift in the local thread factory does Violet come into her name, and bloom. Accepted by her co-workers, the teenager enters the happiest phase of her life, until a terrible accident causes her to retreat once again into her lonely shell.Realizing that she has only one clear choice, Violet boards a bus heading west to California. But when the bus crashes in North Dakota, it seems that fate is having another cruel laugh at Violet’s expense. This time though, Violet laughs back.

On Ideology,,"['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Academic', 'Economics', 'Cultural', 'Anthropology']","The classic analysis of how particular political and cultural ideas come to dominate society.The publication of For Marx and Reading Capital established Louis Althusser as one of the most controversial figures in the Western Marxist tradition, and one of the most influential renewals of Marxist thought. Collected here are Althusser’s most significant philosophical writings from the late sixties and through the seventies. Intended to contribute, in his own words, to a ‘left-wing critique of Stalinism that would help put some substance back into the revolutionary project here in the West’, they are the record of a shared history. At the same time they chart Althusser’s critique of the theoretical system unveiled in his own major works, and his developing practice of philosophy as a ‘revolutionary weapon’.The collection opens with two lucid early articles - ""Theory, Theoretical Practice and Theoretical Formation"" and ""On Theoretical Work."" The title piece - Althusser’s celebrated lectures in the ""Philosophy Course for Scientists"" — is the fullest exploration of his new definition of philosophy as politics in the realm of theory, a conception which is further developed in ""Lenin and Philosophy."" ""Is it Simple to be a Marxist in Philosophy?"" provides an invaluable account of Althusser’s intellectual development. The volume concludes with two little-known late pieces - ""The Transformation of Philosophy,"" in which the paradoxical history of Marxist philosopher is investigated; and ""Marxism today,"" a sober balance-sheet of the Marxist tradition. Attesting to the unique place that Althusser has occupied in modern intellectual history - between a tradition of Marxism that he sought to reconstruct, and a ""post-Marxism"" that has eclipsed its predecessor - these texts are indispensable reading.",,Verso Radical Thinkers,04/01/84,January 17th 2008,[],Paperback,,9781844672028,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373999933l/1450671.jpg,4.04,[],57.0,1.0,,,,95.0,523.0,179,Verso,"['185', '210', '101', '17', '10']",,[],,['Louis Althusser']
On Constitutional Disobedience,,"['Law', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction']","What would the Framers of the Constitution make of multinational corporations? Nuclear weapons? Gay marriage? They led a preindustrial country, much of it dependent on slave labor, huddled on the Atlantic seaboard. The Founders saw society as essentially hierarchical, led naturally by landed gentry like themselves. Yet we still obey their commands, two centuries and one civil war later. According to Louis Michael Seidman, it's time to stop.In On Constitutional Disobedience, Seidman argues that, in order to bring our basic law up to date, it needs benign neglect. This is a highly controversial assertion. The doctrine of ""original intent"" may be found on the far right, but the entire political spectrum--left and right--shares a deep reverence for the Constitution. And yet, Seidman reminds us, disobedience is the original intent of the Constitution. The Philadelphia convention had gathered to amend the Articles of Confederation, not toss them out and start afresh. The ""living Constitution"" school tries to bridge the gap between the framers and ourselves by reinterpreting the text in light of modern society's demands. But this attempt is doomed, Seidman argues. One might stretch ""due process of law"" to protect an act of same-sex sodomy, yet a loyal-but-contemporary reading cannot erase the fact that the Constitution allows a candidate who lost the popular election to be seated as president. And that is only one of the gross violations of popular will enshrined in the document. Seidman systematically addresses and refutes the arguments in favor of Constitutional fealty, proposing instead that it be treated as inspiration, not a set of commands.The Constitution is, at its best, a piece of poetry to liberty and self-government. If we treat it as such, the author argues, we will make better progress in achieving both.",,,12/31/12,January 31st 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780199898275,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355046922l/15856770.jpg,3.71,[],79.0,1.0,,,,91.0,35.0,176,"Oxford University Press, USA","['8', '13', '11', '2', '1']",,[],,['Louis Michael Seidman']

"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God",,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Teen', 'Childrens', 'Comedy', 'Realistic Fiction']","You don't have to be a teenager to appreciate the humorous and often self-absorbed ravings found in 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson's diary, but it certainly helps. Now fans of Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging -- Georgia's first set of hilarious musings on life -- can get another peek into the mind of this wryly inquisitive English lass in the appealing sequel: On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God.As the title implies, Georgia has snagged herself a sex god in the form of Robbie, the boy of her dreams. Now that they've indulged in a bit of ""full-frontal snogging,"" Georgia turns her attention to advancing the relationship. But things quickly go wrong when she learns that her father's new job may necessitate a move to New Zealand. Crestfallen, Georgia feels her life might as well be over. Then, miraculously, the dreaded move is cancelled, and things seem to be getting better -- at least until 17-year-old Robbie decides to break up with Georgia because he's bothered by the difference in their ages. Borrowing freely from her mum's closet and advice books, even as she's steadfastly discounting everything her mum says, a crushed but determined Georgia comes up with a scheme to win Robbie back. As usual, nothing goes as planned, and life is further complicated by Georgia's temperamental cat, Angus (who's having a few amorous leanings of his own), and her baby sister, Libby, whose fascination with (and lack of control over) her bodily functions leads to several intriguing mishaps. Of course, there are other disasters, too: a quick-tan lotion that turns Georgia's legs orange, a run-in with the aptly named Bummer sisters, and friends who insist on focusing on their own problems from time to time.Who knew the angst of adolescence could be so much fun? This Georgia's-eye view of teenage life is wonderfully egocentric and side-splittingly funny. And despite the occasional language barrier (a glossary of terms is provided in the back of the book), Georgia's thoughts and experiences will prove universally recognizable to anyone who is, or has ever been, a teenager.

Diseases such as Alzheimer’s erase parts of one’s memory but are also often said to erase the self. People don’t simply die from such diseases; they are imagined, in the clichés of our era, as vanishing in plain sight, fading away, or enduring a long goodbye. In On Vanishing, Lynn Casteel Harper, a Baptist minister and nursing home chaplain, investigates the myths and metaphors surrounding dementia and aging, addressing not only the indignities caused by the condition but also by the rhetoric surrounding it. Harper asks essential questions about the nature of our outsize fear of dementia, the stigma this fear may create, and what it might mean for us all to try to “vanish well.”Weaving together personal stories with theology, history, philosophy, literature, and science, Harper confronts our elemental fears of disappearance and death, drawing on her own experiences with people with dementia both in the U.S. health-care system and within her own family. In the course of unpacking her own stories and encounters—of leading a prayer group on a dementia unit; of meeting individuals dismissed as “already gone” and finding them still possessed of complex, vital inner lives; of witnessing her grandfather’s final years with Alzheimer’s and discovering her own heightened genetic risk of succumbing to the disease—Harper engages in an exploration of dementia that is unlike anything written before on the subject.Expanding our understanding of dementia beyond progressive vacancy and dread, On Vanishing makes room for beauty and hope, and opens a space in which we might start to consider better ways of caring for, and thinking about, our fellow human beings.

Outcry - Holocaust memoirs,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'Memoir', 'War', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Autobiography', 'Amazon']","Outcry - Holocaust Memoirs, a Profoundly Moving AutobiographyMendel (Manny) Steinberg spent his teens in Nazi extermination camps in Germany and Poland, miraculously surviving while millions perished. This is his story.Born in 1925 in the Jewish ghetto in Radom (Poland), Manny soon realized that people of Jewish faith were increasingly being regarded as outsiders. In September 1939 the Nazis invaded, and the nightmare started. The city’s Jewish population had no chance of escaping and was faced with starvation, torture, sexual abuse and ultimately deportation.Outcry is the candid and moving account of a teenager who survived four Nazi camps: Dachau, Auschwitz, Vaihingen and Neckagerach. While being subjected to torture and degradation, he agonized over two haunting questions: ""Why the Jews?"" and ""How can the world let this happen?"" These questions remain hard to answer.Manny’s brother Stanley had jumped off the cattle wagon on the way to the extermination camp where his mother and younger brother were to perish. Desperately lonely and hungry, Stanley stood outside the compound hoping to catch a glimpse of Manny and their father. Once he discovered that they were among the prisoners, he turned himself in. The days were marked by hunger, cold, hard labor, and fear. Knowing that other members of the family were in the same camp kept them alive. Since acknowledging each other would have meant death, they pretended to be complete strangers.Manny relates how he was served human flesh and was forced to shave the heads of female corpses and pull out their teeth. Cherishing a picture of his beloved mother in his wooden shoe, he miraculously survived the terror of the Polish and German concentration camps together with his father and brother.When the Americans arrived in April 1945, Manny was little more than a living skeleton, with several broken ribs and suffering from a serious lung condition, wearing only a dirty, ragged blanket.This autobiography was written to fulfil a promise Manny made to himself during the first days of freedom. By publishing his Holocaust memoirs, he wants to ensure that the world never forgets what happened during WWII. The narrative is personal, unencumbered and direct.Outcry touches the reader with its directness and simplicity. The story is told through the eyes of an old man forcing himself to relive years of intense suffering. It is an account of human cruelty, but also a testimony to the power of love and hope. Memoirs worthy of being adapted for the big screen.""I read this book with a very heavy heart and tears running down my face. For Manny's endurance and his brother Stanley to be so tested is truly a testament to life! Bad people can do all the harm you want, but if one never gives up, the enemy will never win. Manny and his brother along with others, won. This is proven in this Holocaust book. A book well worth reading and learning from now and for future generations. It proves 'We will survive' ... Very well written as it goes straight to the reader's heart! The pictures are a treat, past, present and future, with a lovely tribute to his beloved, Mimi. Thank you for sharing 'YOU' with the rest of the world, Mr Steinberg! Bless you always.""""Manny Steinberg shares his extraordinary teenage story of surviving four concentration camps in an account noteworthy for its straightforward, unencumbered narrative. His is a story almost everyone can imagine happening to themselves - no less harrowing than more dramatic renditions of Holocaust survival, but somehow more compelling, and universal, for the unembellished simplicity of his style.""""You must read Outcry. You will have tears and joy how this young boy survived the six years in concentration camps in Poland and Germany. It is a hand-made story for a motion picture. Hollywood producers and directors, grab it. We must not allow this to happen again to human people.""",,second (revised) edition,01/01/07,September 24th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411589262l/23268862.jpg,4.46,[],100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,2886.0,250,Amsterdam Publishers,"['1773', '771', '263', '48', '31']",,[],,['Manny Steinberg']

Seeking an answer to the fundamental puzzle of why our universe seems so mathematical, Tegmark proposes a radical idea: that our physical world not only is described by mathematics, but that it is mathematics.

On Charisma and Institution Building: Selected Writings,,"['Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction']","This selection from Max Weber's writings presents his variegated work from one central focus, the relationship between charisma on the one hand, and the process of institution building in the major fields of the social order such as politics, law, economy, and culture and religion on the other. That the concept of charisma is crucially important for understanding the processes of institution building is implicit in Weber's own writings, and the explication of this relationship is perhaps the most important challenge which Weber's work poses for modern sociology. Max Weber on Charisma and Institution Building is a volume in ""The Heritage of Sociology,"" a series edited by Morris Janowitz.

Our Daily Meds: How the Pharmaceutical Companies Transformed Themselves Into Slick Marketing Machines and Hooked the Nation on Prescription Drugs,,"['Nonfiction', 'Medicine', 'Science', 'Health', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Social Science', 'Business']","In the last thirty years, the big pharmaceutical companies have transformed themselves into marketing machines selling dangerous medicines as if they were Coca-Cola or Cadillacs. They pitch drugs with video games and soft cuddly toys for children; promote them in churches and subways, at NASCAR races and state fairs. They've become experts at promoting fear of disease, just so they can sell us hope. No question: drugs can save lives. But the relentless marketing that has enriched corporate executives and sent stock prices soaring has come with a dark side. Prescription pills taken as directed by physicians are estimated to kill one American every five minutes. And that figure doesn't reflect the damage done as the overmedicated take to the roads. ""Our Daily Meds ""connects the dots for the first time to show how corporate salesmanship has triumphed over science inside the biggest pharmaceutical companies and, in turn, how this promotion driven industry has taken over the practice of medicine and is changing American life. It is an ageless story of the battle between good and evil, with potentially life-changing consequences for everyone, not just the 65 percent of Americans who unscrew a prescription cap every day. An industry with the promise to help so many is now leaving a legacy of needless harm. Melody Petersen covered the pharmaceutical beat for ""The New York Times ""for four years.

"One Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'War', 'Russia', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History', 'Historical', 'Presidents']","In October 1962, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union appeared to be sliding inexorably toward a nuclear conflict over the placement of missiles in Cuba. Veteran Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs has pored over previously untapped American, Soviet, and Cuban sources to produce the most authoritative book yet on the Cuban missile crisis. In his hour-by-hour chronicle of those near-fatal days, Dobbs reveals some startling new incidents that illustrate how close we really did come to Armageddon. Here, for the first time, are gripping accounts of Khrushchev's plan to destroy the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo; the accidental overflight of the Soviet Union by an American spy plane; the movement of Soviet nuclear warheads around Cuba during the tensest days of the crisis; the activities of CIA agents inside Cuba; and the crash landing of an American F-106 jet with a live nuclear weapon on board. Dobbs takes us inside the White House and the Kremlin as Kennedy and Khrushchev--rational, intelligent men separated by an ocean of ideological suspicion--agonize over the possibility of war. He shows how these two leaders recognized the terrifying realities of the nuclear age while Castro--never swayed by conventional political considerations--demonstrated the messianic ambition of a man selected by history for a unique mission. As the story unfolds, Dobbs brings us onto the decks of American ships patrolling Cuba; inside sweltering Soviet submarines and missile units as they ready their warheads; and onto the streets of Miami, where anti-Castro exiles plot the dictator's overthrow. Based on exhaustive new research and told in breathtaking prose, here is ariveting account of history's most dangerous hours, full of lessons for our time.",,,,February 2008,"['John F.

On Shirley Hazzard,,['Nonfiction'],"On Shirley Hazzard reveals Michelle de Kretser’s lively intelligence at work and her distinctive wit. This testament to her sustained engagement with Hazzard’s work is, at its core, an appreciation of the significance and joy of good fiction. Receptiveness when reading is a prerequisite for perceptive analysis, according to both de Kretser and Hazzard. And for prose, the “simple and precise,” the “transient and insignificant” are key qualities: “Not moonlight but the glitter of broken glass,” for de Kretser as for Chekhov. Selective biographical details about Hazzard are relayed, too—her leaving Australia and formal education at the age of sixteen, her working, unhappily, at the United Nations in Manhattan, her long friendship with Graham Greene. Hazzard’s morality is also invoked—“solidarity with the vulnerable” and pacifism being of prime importance. Shirley Hazzard (1931–2016) published her first short story in The New Yorker in 1961. The magazine continued to publish her work in the decades thereafter, including excerpts from her most successful and beloved novel, the bestseller and National Book Critics Circle Award winner, The Transit of Venus (1980). Michelle de Kretser’s insightful and provocative appreciation does Hazzard fine justice.",Writers on Writers,,11/01/19,March 10th 2020,[],Hardcover,,9781948226820,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563910188l/50084254._SX318_SY475_.jpg,4.48,[],91.0,1.0,,,,100.0,25.0,112,Catapult,"['13', '11', '1', '0', '0']",,[],,['Michelle de Kretser']

On and Off Bass,,"['Photography', 'Nonfiction']","Mike Watt got his musical start thumping the bass with legendary San Pedro punk trio, The Minutemen in 1980 and he has been at it ever since. Over the years, he’s toured with Dos, fIREHOSE, his own The Black Gang, The Secondmen, The Missingmen, and others, and he has worked bass as a sideman for Porno for Pyros, J Mascis and the Fog, as well as punk godfathers The Stooges.Off the road, at his beloved San Pedro, CA home base, Watt developed a deep interest in photography. In Spring 2010, Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, CA hosted an exhibit of his photos: “Mike Watt: Eye-Gifts from Pedro.” According to Track 16 executive director Laurie Steelink, who curated the exhibit, “He has this knack for finding the early morning sweet spots when venturing out alone on his bike or kayak. The resulting photographs never seem to dry: light, flight, salt, rust, and tide commingle in fiery sunrises, endless heavens, roiling waves and fog.” The photos offer another side of Watt that fans of his punk rock music may not be familiar with: While seemingly serene, many have an underlying tension and that often shows the sharp contrast between industry and nature.In “Mike Watt: On and Off Bass,” photographs that appeared in the exhibit are punctuated by Watt’s poetry and snippets selected from 10 years of his diaries. Watt’s writing is insightful, funny, intimate and honest, as he explores topics like John Coltrane, long hauls and overcoming performance fears. “Mike Watt: On and Off Bass” exposes Watt’s vision as a photographer, diarist and poet, taking its readers on a trip.

Alice is a candidate for the position of junior nurse, grade 4. It is only a few weeks since her release from Borstal. She has returned to her childhood home in the French Colony, where her father, recently retired from his position as chief janitor, continues as part-time healer, and full-time headache for the local church. It seems she has inherited some of his gift.With guidance from the working nurse’s manual, and some tricks she picked up in prison, Alice brings succour to the thousands of patients littering the hospital’s corridors and concrete courtyard. In the process she attracts the attention of a lovesick patient, Teddy Bunt, apprentice to the nefarious ‘Gentleman Squad’ of the Karachi police. They fall in love; Teddy with sudden violence, Alice with cautious optimism.Their love is unexpected, but the consequences are not.Alice soon finds that her new life is built on foundations as unstable as those of her home. A Catholic snubbed by other Catholics, who are in turn hated by everyone around them, she is also put at risk by her husband, who does two things that no member of the Gentlemen Squad has ever done – fall in love with a working girl, and allow a potentially dangerous suspect to get away. Can Teddy and Alice ever live in peace? Can two people make a life together without destroying the very thing that united them? It seems unlikely, but then Alice Bhatti is no ordinary nurse...Filled with wit, colour and pathos, Our Lady of Alice Bhatti is a glorious story of second chances, thwarted ambitions and love in unlikely places, set in the febrile streets of downtown Karachi.

Masako's own search for a way out of the straitjacket of a dead-end life leads her, too, to take drastic action.The complex yet riveting narrative seamlessly combines a convincing glimpse into the grimy world of Japan's yakuza with a brilliant portrayal of the psychology of a violent crime and the ensuing game of cat-and-mouse between seasoned detectives and a group of determined but inexperienced criminals. Kirino has mastered a Thelma and Louise kind of graveyard humor that illuminates her stunning evocation of the pressures and prejudices that drive women to extreme deeds and the friendship that bolsters them in the aftermath.",,,07/15/97,January 4th 2005,"['Masako', 'Yayoi', 'Kuniko', 'Yoshie']",Paperback,,9781400078370,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386749063l/25365.jpg,3.93,"['Naoki Prize 直木三十五賞 Nominee (1997)', 'Edgar Award Nominee for Best Novel (2004)', '日本推理作家協会賞 for Best Novel (1998)', 'このミステリーがすごい！ for Best Japanese Mystery Novel of the Year (1998)']",1755.0,20.0,,,,92.0,26876.0,400,Vintage,"['8386', '11091', '5225', '1533', '641']",,"['Japan', 'Tokyo (Japan)']",,"['Natsuo Kirino', 'Stephen Snyder']"

Organic Church,Growing Faith Where Life Happens,Religion,"Churches have tried all kinds of ways to attract new and younger members - revised vision statements, hipper worship, contemporary music, livelier sermons, bigger and better auditoriums. But there are still so many people who aren't being reached, who don't want to come to church. And the truth is that attendance at church on Sundays does not necessarily transform lives; God's presence in our hearts is what changes us. Leaders and laypeople everywhere are realizing that they need new and more powerful ways to help them spread God's Word. According to international church starter and pastor Neil Cole, if we want to connect with young people and those who are not coming to church, we must go where people congregate. Cole shows readers how to plant the seeds of the Kingdom of God in the places where life happens and where culture is formed - restaurants, bars, coffeehouses, parks, locker rooms,and neighborhoods.

"Obra reunida. Incluye Cartucho, Las manos de mama, etc (Letras Mexicanas) (Spanish Edition)",,[],"This volume contains all of Nellie Campobello's literary production, poetry as well as fiction. In the latter category, the selections include her youthful work Francisca Yo (I, Francisca ) and Tres poemas (Three Poems) from Abra en la Roca (A Crack in the Rock), which showed traces of a refined Modernism. Campobello's fiction was strongly colored by her desire to defend Pancho Villa and his movement, stigmatized by official history as a group of subversive bandits. Thus, Cartucho (Cartridge) is a series of stories about Villa's followers taken from her own experiences, showing their tragic, human, side. Las manos de Mama (My Mother's Hands), in contrast, links the protective figure of the mother, identified here as ""She,"" with the theme of the revolution and Villa's movement.

Here is Lee Harvey Oswald—his family background, troubled marriage, controversial journey to Russia, and return to an “America [waiting] for him like an angry relative whose eyes glare in the heat.” Based on KGB and FBI transcripts, government reports, letters and diaries, and Mailer’s own international research, this is an epic account of a man whose cunning, duplicity, and self-invention were both at home in and at odds with the country he forever altered.  Praise for Oswald’s Tale  “America’s largest mystery has found its greatest interpreter.”—The Washington Post Book World   “Mailer is fierce, courageous, and reckless and nearly everything he writes has sections of headlong brilliance. . . .

Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.",,,,June 4th 2019,[],Hardcover,,9780525562023,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1552172553l/41880609.jpg,4.05,"['National Book Award Nominee for Fiction (2019)', 'PEN/Hemingway Foundation Award Nominee for Longlist (2020)', 'The Center for Fiction First Novel Prize Nominee (0)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Fiction (2019)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction and for Debut Novel (2019)']",478.0,5.0,,,,93.0,70134.0,246,Penguin Press,"['26968', '25186', '13268', '3613', '1099']",,[],,['Ocean Vuong']

He opens a window on his private life, from his boyhood dislike of school to his daughter’s precocious melancholy, from his successful struggle to quit smoking to his anxiety at the prospect of testifying against some clumsy muggers who fell upon him during a visit to New York City. From ordinary obligations such as applying for a passport or sharing a holiday meal with relatives, he takes extraordinary flights of imagination; in extreme moments, such as the terrifying days following a cataclysmic earthquake in Istanbul, he lays bare our most basic hopes and fears. Again and again Pamuk declares his faith in fiction, engaging the work of such predecessors as Laurence Sterne and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, sharing fragments from his notebooks, and commenting on his own novels. He contemplates his mysterious compulsion to sit alone at a desk and dream, always returning to the rich deliverance that is reading and writing.By turns witty, moving, playful, and provocative, Other Colors glows with the energy of a master at work and gives us the world through his eyes, assigning every radiant theme and shifting mood its precise shade in the spectrum of significance.",,First United States Edition,10/29/99,September 18th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780307266750,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348580856l/384221.jpg,3.92,[],196.0,2.0,,,,94.0,2037.0,448,Knopf,"['569', '892', '451', '101', '24']",,[],,"['Orhan Pamuk', 'Maureen Freely']"
Ode to Kirihito,,"['Manga', 'Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Horror', 'Seinen', 'Science Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Sequential Art']","It may or may not be contagious. There seems to be no cure for it. Yet, Monmow Disease, a life-threatening condition that transforms a person into a dog-like beast, is not the only villain in this shocking triumph of a medical thriller by manga-god Osamu Tezuka. Said to have been the personal favorite of the artist, who held a degree in medicine, and surprisingly attentive to Christian themes and imagery, Ode to Kirihito demolishes naive notions about human nature and health and likely preconceptions about the comics master himself.From pregnant vistas of the Japanese countryside to closed rooms full of sin and redemption, Tezuka astounds for more than eight hundred continuous pages, his art in turn easefully concise and flamboyantly experimental, his inquiry into our most repugnant instincts and prospects for overcoming them unflinchingly serious. Incorporating elements of the often lurid and adult-oriented “gekiga” style for the first time, Tezuka entered into his fruitful late period with this work.A promising young doctor, Kirihito Osanai visits a remote Japanese mountain village to investigate the source of the latest medical mystery. While he ends up traveling the world to discover what it takes to be cured of such a disease, a conspiracy back home attempts to explain away his absence. Hinging upon his fate are those of his loved ones: an unstable childhood friend and colleague trapped between factions of the medical establishment that nurtured him; a fiancée emotionally transformed by Kirihito’s mysterious disappearance; and a stranger who becomes his guardian angel, a sensual circus-act performer with volatile psychological secrets. From plutocratic Taipei and racially divided South Africa to backwater Arabia and modern Osaka, ambition and desire beckon “normal men” to behave uglier than any beast. Riveting our attention on deformity and its acceptance like The Elephant Man by David Lynch, Ode to Kirihito examines the true worth of human beings through and beyond appearances.",Kirihito #1-4,,10/30/71,October 24th 2006,[],Paperback,,9781932234640,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327882140l/209571.jpg,4.06,[],96.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1730.0,832,Vertical,"['673', '627', '310', '95', '25']",,[],,"['Osamu Tezuka', 'Camellia Nieh']"

Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,,Fiction,"From Longman's new Cultural Editions Series, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, edited by Andrew Elfenbein, includes the novel and contextual materials from the era of Oscar Wilde. This edition of Oscar Wilde's classic work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, highlights the novel's modernity in both its form and its revolutionary content, and traces its links to modernist literature and the culture of modernity alike. Previous editions of the novel have only seen it in a late Victorian context, or as an extension of the aesthetic theories of Walter Pater and the ""art for art's sake"" movement. As presented in this new edition, however, the freshness and originality of the book emerges, along with its strong social messages. The book is a pastiche of genres that propels nineteenth-century realism into twentieth-century modernism ahead of its own time. Wilde's novel offers a myth for modernity whose hold on the cultural imagination has only strengthened over time-Dorian Gray's uncanny bond with his own portrait underscores the loss of selfhood everyone experiences in a world of images and copies, paves the way for the discourses of homosexuality and the understanding of lifestyle as identity so current today, and provides clues to the mysteries of modern ethics and politics. The edition also emphasizes the role of gender and the rise of female emancipation underlying the Sybil Vane subplot, a focus on women that intensifies the book's relevance to modern transformations of men and women alike.",,,,2007.0,,,0321427130,9780321427137,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dhxDPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.07,,,,,,,,,352.0,,,119.0,,,"['Oscar Wilde', 'Andrew Elfenbein']"

Subjects of the stories include Arachne and Niobe; Tereus, Procne, and Philomela; Medea and Jason; Orpheus and Eurydice; and many others, familiar and unfamiliar. For students of Latin-and teachers, too-they provide an interesting experience. In his introduction the editor discusses Ovid’s career, the reputation of the Metamorphoses during Ovid’s time and after, and the various manuscripts that exist or have been known to exist. He describes the general plan of the poem, its main theme, and the problem of its tone. Technical matters, such as style and meter, are also considered.

Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music,,['Music'],"As founder and editor of Crawdaddy! magazine, Paul Williams has helped the rock music field itself, as well as outsiders, to recognize the importance of rock as a modern music and as a facet of modern experience. In Outlaw Blues, his first book, the author presents his own experience of rock music, the history of his reactions and insights over a two-year period. For a critic to offer something true to his readers, he must be more than an appraiser. He must be a listener, deeply and passionately involved in the experience he describes, a lover rather than an observer. Outlaw Blues is a book full of feeling, a guide to one man's musical experience that is intended to bring all its readers closer to the nature of their own relationship with music, with the joy that bursts from the transistor radios and the open doors of the concert halls. The author says: ""I see rock as a means of expression, an opportunity for beauty, an art. So what I have written is expression, not explanation; an attempt to convey what I feel from the music, an exploration of what rock does to me."" Paul Williams offers us in Outlaw Blues the same warmth and honesty of style, the same acute sensitivity and insight into the workings of contemporary music, that have made him the most respected writer in his field--admired as much by the men he writes about as the listeners he writes for. His first book makes it clear that he deserves that admiration.",,,,February 1st 2000,[],Paperback,,9780934558358,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348830275l/1165534.jpg,4.07,[],88.0,1.0,,,,93.0,14.0,212,Entwhistle Books,"['5', '6', '2', '1', '0']",,[],,"['Paul Williams', 'Michael Lydon']"

Souza was with President Obama more often, and at more crucial moments, than any friend or staff member, or even the First Lady--and he photographed it all.

This seminal work on the Obama presidency documents moments of national importance--including the historic image of the President and his advisors watching tensely in the Situation Room as the Bin Laden mission unfolded--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his many encounters with children, and his time spent interacting with world leaders, members of Congress, White House staff, artists, musicians and more.The photographs are paired with captions and stories providing behind-the-scenes context for each, and offer insight into the special relationship Souza and the President forged during their time together.

Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the unspoken chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which it was purged of the Kashmiri Pandit community in a violent ethnic cleansing backed by Islamist militants. Hundreds of people were tortured and killed, and about 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave their homes and spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country.

Our Virtuous Republic: The Forgotten Clause in the American Social Contract,,[],"Is it no longer a ""self-evident"" truth that government's nature is to become tyrannical? ""Our Virtuous Republic"" is the book the establishment does not want Americans on the right, left, or center to read. The argument is a vociferous and comprehensive defense of American traditionalism, a lesson in American citizenship, and a call for a return to civil society. Conservatives academics and politicians have failed to make a decisive argument for our founding principles. As a result, the progressive narrative has attached an unsubstantiated backward stigma to the ideals born of the American mainstream Protestant ethic, such as civic duty, obligation and other elements of American traditionalism that are necessary for a healthy society. Baris uses psychology, logic, economics, history, and science to deconstruct the progressive argument to its regressive core. Breaking through the superficial, he explains how our human nature interacts with the different elements of each political philosophy in American politics. The evidence, in total, points to one conclusion. There is a Natural Law that illuminates the path to human happiness and well-being. Our Founding Fathers designed the American social contract in accordance with Natural Law to ensure that we would all have the opportunity to achieve the highest state of being.

On the Edge,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Cars', 'British Literature', 'True Story']","Richard Hammond is one of our most in-demand and best-loved television presenters. On September 20, 2006, he suffered a serious brain injury following a high-speed car crash, and the nation held its breath. On the Edge is his compelling account of life before and after the accident and an honest description of his year of recovery, full of drama and incident. It is also, perhaps, his explanation of why, as a married man and father of two young daughters, he was prepared to risk all by strapping himself to the front of a jet engine with the power of eleven Formula One cars. A daredevil and a petrolhead long before his association with Top Gear, Richard tells the story of his life as an adrenalin junkie, from the small boy showing off with ridiculous stunts on his bicycle to the adolescent with a near-obsessive attraction to speed and the smell of petrol. After a series of jobs in local radio, he graduated to television and eventually to Top Gear, one of the world's most popular shows, upgrading his car with each step up the ladder. His insights into the personalities, the camaraderie and, of course, the stunts for which Top Gear has become famous make compulsive reading.It was whilst filming for Top Gear, driving a jet-powered dragster at speeds over 300mph, that a tyre burst and the car left the track and rolled over, burying him in the earth. He was airlifted to hospital and hovered near death for several days. His wife Mindy tells the story of the anxious hours and days of watching and waiting until he finally emerged from his coma. In an extraordinarily powerful piece of writing, she and Richard then piece together the stages of his recovery as his shattered mind slowly reformed, leaving him sometimes lucid and plausible, sometimes confused and angry, and often exhausted. The final chapter recounts his return home and his triumphant reappearance in front of the cameras.",,,09/20/07,April 1st 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780297853275,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312500992l/1926218.jpg,3.96,[],99.0,1.0,,,,93.0,3770.0,310,Orion Publishing,"['1259', '1437', '796', '212', '66']",,[],,"['Richard Hammond', 'Mindy Hammond']"

But, fate has something else in store for him. Now Rishi is in a dilemma. On one side is 'Ananya', the love of his life and on the other side is 'Pragya', a dying and needy friend. On one side is his most ruined past, while on the other his present, his future. He has to choose between the two.

Our Chances Were Zero: The Daring Escape by Two German Pow's from India in 1942,,[],"During World War II the British imprisoned many German and Italian prisoners of war and civilian internees in India. The less co-operative prisoners were kept under harsh conditions in camps in the Himalayan foothills. The author was a German civilian working in India at the outbreak of war and was promptly interned by the British. In 1942 Magener and another prisoner, Heins von Have, finally managed to escape. Getting out of the camp was only the prelude to the difficult task of making their way across the entire Indian sub-continent in an attempt to reach friendly territory. Disguising themselves as British officers, the two Germans made an epic journey across India and through British forces on the Burma frontier in an attempt to link up with advancing Japanese forces. Ironically, the Japanese unit they finally located did not believe their story and they came close to being executed as spies.His grippingly told personal narrative of a German's escape from Allied custody is unique in the annals of prisoner-of-war escape and evasion.",,,April 2002,March 5th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780850528442,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348842556l/1473416.jpg,4.16,[],28.0,1.0,,,,96.0,75.0,192,Leo Cooper,"['31', '29', '12', '2', '1']",,[],,['Rolf Magener']

I plan to indulge in a different manner — by pursuing everything I wish had been a part of my youth. Things I always felt were part of most North Americans' adolescent experience.

That may be bad news for America, but it can be good news for the church. What's needed now, in shifting times, is neither a doubling-down on the status quo nor a pullback into isolation. Instead, we need a church that speaks to social and political issues with a bigger vision in mind: that of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Christianity seems increasingly strange, and even subversive, to our culture, we have the opportunity to reclaim the freakishness of the gospel, which is what gives it its power in the first place.   We seek the kingdom of God, before everything else. We connect that kingdom agenda to the culture around us, both by speaking it to the world and by showing it in our churches. As we do so, we remember our mission to oppose demons, not to demonize opponents. As we advocate for human dignity, for religious liberty, for family stability, let's do so as those with a prophetic word that turns everything upside down.   The signs of the times tell us we are in for days our parents and grandparents never knew.

Inspired by the Face on Mars and the unexplainable technological marvels that predate the rise of Egypt by thousands of years, S DeGiorgio offers an eerily plausible connection between Mars and the rise of modern civilization. This novel is rocket fuel for people seeking answers to the question, “Are we alone?” It’s 2050, Earth’s resources are nearly gone, and armies guard what precious little remains. As mankind prepares to set foot on Mars, leaders of an ancient society are forced out of the shadows to protect secrets they’ve guarded for millennia. Orion’s crew gets caught in the middle, and on the eve of Earth’s first manned mission to Mars, unknown adversaries murder four of their own. As the reserve team is pressed into service, fears grow that co-conspirators may be on board. No one’s ever gone farther than the moon. Rumor and espionage threaten to tear the crew apart at a time when America can’t afford to fail, and they only have each other, elite training, and raw instincts to rely on. Not everyone believes they will make it home. Some even consider them expendable—acceptable losses to advance the cause. Control of Mars’ mineral rights will reestablish America’s position as the leader of the free world. Standing down is not an option—but we’re not the only country in the race for the red planet. “This story kept me spellbound and on the edge of my seat!

When she traveled to the Kingdom of Silences to prevent them from going to war with her home, the Kingdom of the Mists, she wasn’t expecting to return with a cure for elf-shot and a whole new set of political headaches. Now the events she unwittingly set in motion could change the balance of modern Faerie forever, and she has been ordered to appear before a historic convocation of monarchs, hosted by Queen Windermere in the Mists and overseen by the High King and Queen themselves. Naturally, things have barely gotten underway when the first dead body shows up. As the only changeling in attendance, Toby is already the target of suspicion and hostility. Now she needs to find a killer before they can strike again—and with the doors locked to keep the guilty from escaping, no one is safe. As danger draws ever closer to her allies and the people she loves best, Toby will have to race against time to prevent the total political destabilization of the West Coast and to get the convocation back on track…and if she fails, the cure for elf-shot may be buried forever, along with the victims she was too slow to save.

Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer,,"['Nonfiction', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Health Care', 'Science', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'History', 'Social Issues']","Though touted as perhaps the best in the world, the American medical system is filled with hypocrisies. Our health care is staggeringly expensive, yet one in six Americans has no health insurance. We have some of the most skilled physicians in the world, yet one hundred thousand patients die each year from medical errors. In this gripping, eye-opening book, award-winning journalist Shannon Brownlee takes readers inside the hospital to dismantle some of our most venerated myths about American medicine. Using vivid examples of real patients and physicians, Overtreated debunks the idea that most of medicine is based in sound science, and shows how our health care system delivers huge amounts of unnecessary care that is not only expensive and wasteful but can actually imperil the health of patients.The interests of politicians and the medical-industrial complex continually trump those of patients, seducing the wealthy with unnecessary procedures and leaving the poor with haphazard access to treatment. Backward economic incentives allow patients with chronic conditions to receive ineffective care, and roll after roll of red tape undermines even the best-intentioned doctors. Tens of thousands of patients die each year from overtreatment. American medicine is in desperate need of fixing.Nevertheless, Overtreated ultimately conveys a message of hope by reframing the debate over health care reform. Americans worry about rationing--that any effort to rein in the high cost of health care will result in limited access to life-saving treatments. Covering the uninsured seems like an insurmountable problem because it will drive up costs even more. Overtreated offers a way to control costs and cover the uninsured, while simultaneously improving the quality of American medicine. Shannon Brownlee's humane, intelligent, and penetrating analysis empowers readers to avoid the perils of overtreatment, as well as pointing the way to better health care for everyone.",,,,September 18th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781582345802,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431397952l/469778.jpg,4.02,[],6.0,1.0,,,,94.0,908.0,343,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,"['322', '351', '180', '40', '15']",,[],,['Shannon Brownlee']

Once & Future Giants: What Ice Age Extinctions Tell Us about the Fate of Earth's Largest Animals,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Nature', 'Palaeontology', 'Natural History', 'Animals', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Environment']","Until about 13,000 years ago, North America was home to a menagerie of massive mammals. Mammoths, camels, and lions walked the ground that has become Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles and foraged on the marsh land now buried beneath Chicago's streets. Then, just as the first humans reached the Americas, these Ice Age giants vanished forever. In Once and Future Giants, science writer Sharon Levy digs through the evidence surrounding Pleistocene large animal (""megafauna"") extinction events worldwide, showing that understanding this history--and our part in it--is crucial for protecting the elephants, polar bears, and other great creatures at risk today. These surviving relatives of the Ice Age beasts now face an intensified replay of that great die-off, as our species usurps the planet's last wild places while driving a warming trend more extreme than any in mammalian history. Inspired by a passion for the lost Pleistocene giants, some scientists advocate bringing elephants and cheetahs to the Great Plains as stand-ins for their extinct native brethren. By reintroducing big browsers and carnivores to North America, they argue, we could rescue some of the planet's most endangered animals while restoring healthy prairie ecosystems. Critics, including biologists enmeshed in the struggle to restore native species like the gray wolf and the bison, see the proposal as a dangerous distraction from more realistic and legitimate conservation efforts. Deftly navigating competing theories and emerging evidence, Once and Future Giants examines the extent of human influence on megafauna extinctions past and present, and explores innovative conservation efforts around the globe. The key to modern-day conservation, Levy suggests, may lie fossilized right under our feet.",,,February 17th 2011,March 22nd 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780195370126,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347251266l/9866998.jpg,4.0,[],36.0,1.0,,,,95.0,171.0,255,"Oxford University Press, USA","['51', '80', '31', '7', '2']",,[],,['Sharon Levy']

One Stick Song,,"['Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Native Americans', 'Literature', 'Read For School']","Poetry. Native American Studies. ""Whether slyly identifying irony as a white man's invention, or deftly moving from prose-like multilayered narratives to formal poetry and song structures, this fifth collection from poet, novelist, and screenwriter Alexie demonstrates many of his skills. Most prominent perhaps is his ability to handle multiple perspectives and complex psychological subject matter with a humor that feeds readability: 'Successful non-Indian writers are viewed as well-informed about Indian life. Successful mixed-blood writers are viewed as wonderful translators of Indian life. Successful Indian writers are viewed as traditional storytellers of Indian life.' Poems such as the title one, a haunting chant for lost family, and 'The Theology of Cockroaches, ' do some vivid scene setting: '...never/woke to a wall filled with cockroaches/spelling out my name, never/stepped into a dark room and heard/the cockroaches baying at the moon.' At times Alexie allows his language, within the lineated poems almost exclusively, to slacken into cliche.

Finally, late in the evening, two helicopters bore the terrorists and their surviving hostages to Munichs little-used Fürstenfeldbruck airfield, where events went tragically awry.

Obedience to Authority,,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Social Science', 'Politics', 'History', 'Research', 'Classics']","Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to. Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others. Obedience, as a determinant of behavior is of particular relevance to our time. It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.Obedience is the psychological mechanism that links individual action to political purpose. It is the dispositional cement that binds men to systems of authority. Facts of recent history and observation in daily life suggest that for many people obedience may be a deeply ingrained behavior tendency, indeed, a prepotent impulse overriding training in ethics, sympathy, and moral conduct. C. P. Snow (1961) points to its importance when he writes:When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that, read William Sbirer's 'Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.' The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience . . . in the name of obedience they were party to, andassisted in, the most wicked large scale actions in the history of the world. (p. 24)The Nazi extermination of European Jews is the most extremeinstance of abhorrent immoral acts carried out by thousands ofpeople in the name of obedience. Yet in lesser degree this type ofthing is constantly recurring: ordinary citizens are ordered todestroy other people, and they do so because they consider ittheir duty to obey orders. Thus, obedience to authority, longpraised as a virtue, takes on a new aspect when it serves amalevolent cause; far from appearing as a virtue, it is transformedinto a heinous sin. Or is it?The moral question of whether one should obey when commands conflict with conscience was argued by Plato, dramatized in ""Antigone,"" and treated to philosophic analysis in every historical epoch Conservative philosophers argue that the very fabric of society is threatened by disobedience, and even when the act prescribed by an authority is an evil one, it is better to carry out the act than to wrench at the structure of authority. Hobbes stated further that an act so executed is in no sense the responsibility of the person who carries it out but only of the authority that orders it. But humanists argue for the primacy of individual conscience in such matters, insisting that the moral judgments of the individual must override authority when the two are in conflict.The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous import, but an empirically grounded scientist eventually comes to the point where he wishes to move from abstract discourse to the careful observation of concrete instances. In order to take a close look at the act of obeying, I set up a simple experimentat Yale University. Eventually, the experiment was to involve more than a thousand participants and would be repeated at several universities, but at the beginning, the conception was simple. A person comes to a psychological laboratory and is told to carry out a series of acts that come increasingly into conflict with conscience. The main question is how far the participant will comply with the experimenter's instructions before refusing to carry out the actions required of him.But the reader needs to know a little more detail about the experiment. Two people come to a psychology laboratory to take part in a study of memory and learning. One of them is designated as a ""teacher"" and the other a ""learner."" The experimenter explains that the study is concerned with the effects of punishment on learning. The learner is conducted into a room, seated in a chair, his arms strapped to prevent excessive movement, and an electrode attached to his wrist. He is told that he is to learn a list of word pairs; whenever he makes an error, be will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity.The real focus of the experiment is the teacher. After watching the learner being strapped into place, he is taken into the main experimental room and seated before an impressive shock generator. Its main feature is a horizontal line of thirty switches, ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts, in 15-volt increments. There are also verbal designations which range from Slight SHOCK to Danger--Severe SHOCK. The teacher is told that he is to administer the learning test to the man in the other room. When the learner responds correctly, the teacher moves on to the next item; when the other man gives an incorrectanswer, the teacher is to give him an electric shock. He is to start at the lowest shock level ( 15 volts) and to increase the level each time the man makes an error, going through 30 volts, 45 volts, and so on.The ""teacher"" is a genuinely naive subject who has come to the laboratory to participate in an experiment. The learner, or victim, is an actor who actually receives no shock at all. The point of the experiment is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.",,,10/30/74,August 8th 1983,[],Paperback,,9780061319839,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403550976l/676723.jpg,4.2,['National Book Award Finalist for The Sciences (1975)'],154.0,2.0,,,,96.0,3491.0,256,Harper Perennial,"['1573', '1226', '554', '103', '35']",,[],,['Stanley Milgram']

Ollie: The True Story of a Brief and Courageous Life,,[],"Like the swallows, our son Ollie came in the spring and left in the autumn. Dancing, singing, swooping - there was something birdlike about his energy, joy and laughter - but also the fleeting, enigmatic quality of his life. When he was two he lost all his speech, as autism turned his life - and ours - into a baffling challenge. Then at four he had to face a new challenge when he almost died from leukaemia. But chemotherapy worked its magic and he made a full recovery. He was a tough survivor and nothing seemed to dim his spirit: he could light up a room and energize everyone around him. So it was a huge shock, after several cancer-free years, when a fatal brain tumour was discovered. This time his body had had enough and he died very suddenly. He was twelve. Ollie had extraordinary courage and endurance. Time after time he bounced back, determined to enjoy life. He was obstinate, mischievous, playful, flirtatious, quixotic, funny. He generated - and continues to generate - huge amounts of laughter. And he was very beautiful.

A hero on the court, senior Sam Styles has led Greenspark Academy to three consecutive state championships. He has become an off-court mover-and-shaker as well, and he sends a shockwave through the school's social hierarchy when he decides that capping his own high school career with a fourth victory will not be enough: he wants the girls' team to win one, too. Standing between the girls and that state trophy is the person who is also their best hope of gaining it, a sophomore known as the Mutant, a/k/a Deanie Gauthier. She is attitude incarnate, a quicksilver playmaker on the court and a defiant pariah off it, as disliked as Sam is popular. If the girls are going to go all the way, Sam realizes, he will have to straighten her out. Saving Deanie from herself is no easy task, however. Behind the wild, tough girl, Sam discovers an unexpected soul mate, and he isn't prepared for the volatile, disturbing relationship that ignites between them and cuts radically across the grain of Greenspark's traditions. He wants her to take her team to the championships; she wants to take him where he's never been before. They both get more than they bargain for - Deanie must surrender the secrets shielded by her Mutant facade, and Sam must take on their burden. It is an exchange that will transform both their lives. One on One is a remarkably engaging story of sexual initiation and awakening into love, of how growing up breaks and remakes family, of an adolescent culture that makes its own rules and enforces them its own way.

The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer.  The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, Of Time and the River illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present. It is a novel that is majestic and enduring. As P. M. Jack observed in The New York Times, ""It is a triumphant demonstration that Thomas Wolfe has the stamina to produce a magnificent epic of American life.""

Six Jedi Masters, twelve Jedi Knights, and fifty thousand men, women, and children will embark–aboard a gargantuan vessel, equipped for years of travel–on a mission to contact intelligent life and colonize undiscovered worlds beyond the known galaxy. The government bureaucracy threatens to scuttle the expedition before it can even start–until Master C’baoth foils a murderous conspiracy plot, winning him the political capital he needs to set in motion the dream of Outbound Flight.Or so it would seem. For unknown to the famed Jedi Master, the successful launch of the mission is secretly being orchestrated by an unlikely ally: the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who has his own reasons for wanting Outbound Flight to move forward . . . and, ultimately, to fail. Yet Darth Sidious is not the mission’s most dangerous challenge. Once underway, the starship crosses paths at the edge of Unknown Space with the forces of the alien Chiss Ascendancy and the brilliant mastermind best known as “Thrawn.” Even Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, aboard Outbound Flight with his young Padawan student, Anakin Skywalker, cannot help avert disaster. Thus what begins as a peaceful Jedi mission is violently transformed into an all-out war for survival against staggering odds–and the most diabolical of adversaries.Timothy Zahn’s unique mix of espionage, political gamesmanship, and deadly interstellar combat breathes electrifying life into a Star Wars legend.From the Hardcover edition.",Star Wars Legends,,10/30/06,January 30th 2007,"['Sheev Palpatine', 'Thrawn', ""Jorus C'boath"", 'Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'Anakin Skywalker', 'Kinman Doriana']",Paperback,,9780345456847,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405546347l/192523.jpg,3.93,[],170.0,2.0,,,,94.0,11606.0,480,Del Rey,"['3538', '4507', '2902', '570', '89']",,[],,['Timothy Zahn']

A teenage boy in his final year, on a scholarship, has learned to fit in with his adoptive tribe while concealing as much as possible about himself and his background.

Then, provided novel and unique solutions to them.It expands on the meaning of social entropy and explains how it affects all social systems.

"One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate",,"['History', 'Israel', 'Nonfiction', 'Jewish', 'British Literature', 'Politics', 'Military Fiction', '20th Century', 'Religion', 'Judaism']","One Palestine, Complete explores the tumultuous period before the creation of the state of Israel. This was the time of the British Mandate, when Britain's promise to both Jews and Arabs that they would inherit the land, set in motion the conflict that haunts the region to this day.Drawing on untapped archival materials, Tom Segev reconstructs an era (1917 to 1948) of limitless possibilities and tragic missteps. He introduces an array unforgettable characters, tracks the steady advance of Jews and Arabs toward confrontation, and puts forth a radical new argument: that the British, far from being pro-Arab, consistently favored the Zionist position, out of the mistaken--and anti-Semitic--belief that Jews turned the wheels of history.

What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder?Eco's encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly, revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we're most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton's Satan to Goethe's Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs, hermits, and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky, kitsch, and camp, and the aesthetics of excess and vice.

Simpson case that no one else has dared to write, that no one else could write. In Outrage, the famed prosecutor of Charles Manson and bestselling author of Helter Skelter goes to the heart of the trial that divided the country and made a mockery of justice.  Vincent Bugliosi, who never lost a murder case, brilliantly outlines the five reasons why O.J. Simpson got away with murder: the worst possible jury, a sloppy and incomplete prosecution, a fatal change of venue, judicial error that allowed the defense to play the race card, and a weak summation and rebuttal that barely addressed the defense's frame-up and conspiracy theories. He reveals:--The offer Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman should never have refused.--The bluff that saved the defense's cardboard case.--What Deputy Sheriff Jeff Stuart overheard when Rosey Grier visited Simpson in jail.--The 17 words Johnnie Cochran used to cover his argument that could have been his undoing if caught. --Why the jurors never heard Simpson's first police interview-- filled with self-incriminating statements that alone could have convicted him of murder.1.  What mistake in jury selection could have cost Marcia Clark the trial--even before she argued the case?2.

One Nation Under God,,"['Dystopia', 'Politics', 'Atheism', 'Religion']","In the year 2021, eleven-year old Mary Christopher is the spunky daughter of the latest President vowing to return America to its righteous roots. Her mother is a well-known ?family values? activist, and her Uncle Gene Sisco is head of the largest evangelical Christian organization in the land. Against the backdrop of an America where Christian fundamentalism has brought about tremendous change in Washington, Mary's is a conflicted coming-of-age story, in which she questions everything from her faith to her sexuality, and ultimately becomes one more victim of her father's repressive legislation. Other figures in her life include: Jude, an atheist Mary befriends on the Internet; Vicki, the girl at camp for whom Mary develops confusing feelings; J. E. Cooper, the freelance reporter who labels Gene Sisco the most dangerous man in America; and Jefferson Paine, the mysterious figure behind the infamous Voice of Reason website, dedicated to challenging the Christopher administration at every turn. The novel takes events from present-day and extrapolates them to a possible conclusion two short decades from now. The list of controversial topics in this fable is long, covering everything from radical education techniques to communal living, group marriages to the failings of religion.

Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment.According to W. Edwards Deming, American companies require nothing less than a transformation of management style and of governmental relations with industry. In Out of the Crisis, originally published in 1982, Deming offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future, he claims, brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved product and service.

Sebald completed this controversial book before his death in December 2001. On the Natural History of Destruction is his harrowing and precise investigation of one of the least examined silences of our time. In it, the novelist examines the devastation of German cities by Allied bombardment and the reasons for the astonishing absence of this unprecedented trauma from German history and culture. This historical void is in part a repression of things -- such as the death by fire of the city of Hamburg at the hands of the RAF -- too terrible to bear. But rather than record the crises about them, writers sought to retrospectively justify their actions under the Nazis. For Sebald, this is an example of deliberate cultural amnesia. His analysis of its effects in and outside Germany has already provoked angry painful debate. Sebald's novels are rooted in meticulous observation. His essays are novelistic. They include his childhood recollections of the war that spurred his horror at the collective amnesia around him. There are moments of black humor and, throughout, the sensitivity of his intelligence.

Our Oriental Heritage,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'World History', 'Ancient History', 'India', 'Historical', 'China', 'Audiobook', 'Reference']","This is the classic reference on world history, recognized as the most comprehensive general history ever written, the result of four decades of work by Will and Ariel Durant -- a set that The New York Times called ""a splendid, broad panorama of hereditary culture in words and images that the layman can fully understand."" This series began as an effort to write a history on the nineteenth century, an undertaking that Will Durant realized could only be understood in terms of what had come before. So the Durants embarked on an encyclopedic survey of all civilization, ancient and modern, Occidental and Oriental. The books:
  
Our Oriental Heritage (Volume 1): Will Durant opens his massive survey of civilized history with a sweeping look at the Orient: the Egyptians, who perfected monumental architecture, medicine and mummification; the Babylonians, who developed astronomy and physics; the Judeans, who preserved their culture in the immortal books of the Old Testament; and the Persians, who ruled the largest empire in recorded history before Rome.The Life of Greece (Volume 2): Will Durant's survey of ancient Greece shows us the origins of democracy and the political legacy to the Western world; the golden age of Athens, its architecture, poetry, drama, sculpture and Olympic contests; the blossoming of philosophical thought amid a society still rooted in slavery and barbarism; and the mysterious lost island of Crete, land of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth.
  
Caesar and Christ (Volume 3): Spanning a millenium in Roman history, the third volume in the Durants' series shows us a world-conquering Roman army, undefeated, unafraid and...vegeterian; Hannibal, who transported an army of elephants over the Alps to invade Rome; Julius Caesar, who brought Western Europe under Roman rule; the life and Passion of Christ; and the struggle of the rising church.
  
The Age of Faith (Volume 4): Over 1,000 years, we meet the Christian ascetics and martyrs, including Simeon Stylites, who sat atop a pillar for 30 years, exposed to rain, sun, and snow, and rejoiced as worms ate his rotting flesh; the saints, including Augustine, the most influential philosopher of his age; Mohammed, the desert merchant who founded a religion that conquered one-third of the known world in two centuries; and the Italian poet Dante, whose sensibility marks the transition to the Renaissance.
  
The Renaissance (Volume 5): In this volume, Will Durant examines the economic seeds -- the growth of industry, the rise of banking families, the conflicts of labor and capital -- for Italy's emergence as the first nation to feel the awakening of the modern mind. He follows the cultural flowering from Florence to Milan to Verona and eventually to Rome, allowing us to witness a colorful pageant of princes, queens, poets, painters, sculptors and architects. We see humanity moved boldly from a finite world to an infinite one.
  
The Reformation (Volume 6): In Europe's tumultuous emergence from the Middle Ages, we encounter two rival popes fighting for control of a corrupt, cynical church; the Hundred Years' War and 13-year-old warrior Joan of Arc; Christopher Columbus' accidental discovery of the New World; and Martin Luther, who defied the pope and ultimately led Northern Europe into the age of individualism.
  
The Age of Reason Begins (Volume 7): In one of Europe's most turbulent centuries, Philip II of Spain sees his ""invincible"" armada suffer defeat at the hands of England; Elizabeth I of England receives assistance from explorer Walter Raleigh and pirate Francis Drake; and new appeals for reason and science are exemplified in the ideas of Copernicus, Galileo and Descartes.
  
The Age of Louis XIV (Volume 8): This installment is the biography of a period some consider the apex of modern European civilization. ""Some centuries hence,"" Frederick the Great predicted to Voltaire, ""they will translate the good authors of the time of Louis XIV as we translate those of the age of Pericles or Augustus."" Those authors are lovingly treated here: Pascal and Fenelon, Racine and Boileau, Mme. de Sevigne and Mme. de La Fayette, and, above all, the philosopher-dramatist Moliere, exposing the vices and hypocrisies of the age.
  
The Age of Voltaire (Volume 9): A biography of a great man and the period he embodied. We witness Voltaire's satiric work in the salons and the theater as well as his banishment to England. With him we view the complex relationships between nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and peasantry in the France of Louis XV. We explore the music of Bach and the struggle between Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa of Austria. And finally we hear an imaginary discussion between Voltaire and Pope Benedict XIV on the significance and value of religion.
  
Rousseau and Revolution (Volume 10): This volume ranges over a Europe in ferment, but centers on the passionate rebel-philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who contended with Voltaire for the mind of Europe. Rousseau condemned civilization as a disease, glorified the noble savage, proclaimed to the world with equal intensity his own love affairs and the natural rights of man, and became the patron saint of the French Revolution and social upheavals across the globe for two centuries.
  
The Age of Napoleon (Volume 11): The final volume. Napoleon is the archetypical hero, whose restless, ambitious, and intelligent mind dominated his age and has never ceased to fascinate the world he helped fashion. Yet even Bonaparte is dwarfed by the age that took his name. For, the Durants have re-created the life, the history, the arts, the science, the politics, the philosophy, the manners and the morality, the very spirit of the turbulent epoch that began with the French Revolution, ended with the fall of the emperor and ushered in the modern world.

(1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier—and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.",Great Plains Trilogy #1,,10/28/13,1992,['Alexandra Bergson'],Paperback,,9780679743620,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388956566l/140963.jpg,3.87,[],2921.0,45.0,,,,92.0,45610.0,159,Vintage,"['13465', '17720', '10575', '2720', '1130']",,['Nebraska (United States)'],,['Willa Cather']

Nothing in Jake's life is the same after Vanni, a whip-smart, wisecracking Indian-Irish-Canadian joins his class, and after Jake meets the unforgettable Alba, who is as stunning as she is unattainable.

The Twins were playing their debut season, ice-cold root beers were selling out at the soda counter of Halderson’s Drugstore, and Hot Stuff comic books were a mainstay on every barbershop magazine rack. It was a time of innocence and hope for a country with a new, young president. But for thirteen-year-old Frank Drum it was a grim summer in which death visited frequently and assumed many forms. Accident. Nature. Suicide. Murder. Frank begins the season preoccupied with the concerns of any teenage boy, but when tragedy unexpectedly strikes his family— which includes his Methodist minister father; his passionate, artistic mother; Juilliard-bound older sister; and wise-beyond-his-years kid brother— he finds himself thrust into an adult world full of secrets, lies, adultery, and betrayal, suddenly called upon to demonstrate a maturity and gumption beyond his years. Told from Frank’s perspective forty years after that fateful summer, Ordinary Grace is a brilliantly moving account of a boy standing at the door of his young manhood, trying to understand a world that seems to be falling apart around him.

Othello,,Drama,"In Othello, Shakespeare creates powerful drama from a marriage between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona that begins with elopement and mutual devotion and ends with jealous rage and death. Shakespeare builds many differences into his hero and heroine, including race, age, and cultural background. Yet most readers and audiences believe the couple's strong love would overcome these differences were it not for Iago, who sets out to destroy Othello. Iago's false insinuations about Desdemona's infidelity draw Othello into his schemes, and Desdemona is subjected to Othello's horrifying verbal and physical assaults.

Othello,,"['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'School', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Read For School', 'Poetry', 'Tragedy']","In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.",,,10/28/03,01/01/04,"['Iago', 'Bianca', 'Othello', 'Miguel Cássio', 'Desdêmona', 'Emilia', 'Rodrigo']",Paperback,,9780743477550,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105l/12996._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],47570.0,684.0,,,,92.0,315131.0,314,Simon Schuster,"['99073', '114139', '77115', '19456', '5348']",,"['Venice (Italy)', 'Cyprus']",,['William Shakespeare']
