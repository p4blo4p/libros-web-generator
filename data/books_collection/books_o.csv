"O.E. Rølvaag, Lincoln Colcord (Translator/Introduction)",Giants in the Earth,,English,,"Giants in the Earth (Norwegian: Verdens Grøde) is a novel by Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag. First published in Norway as two books in 1924 and 1925, the author collaborated with Minnesotan Lincoln Colcord on the English translation.The novel follows a Norwegian family's struggles as they try to make a new life as pioneers in the Dakota territory. Rølvaag is interested in psychology and the human cost of empire building, at a time when other writers focused on the glamor and romance of the West. The book reflects his personal experiences as a settler as well as the immigrant homesteader experience of his wife’s family. Both the grim realities of pioneering and the gloomy fatalism of the Norse mind are captured in depictions of snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land. It is a novel at once palpably European and distinctly American.Giants in the Earth was turned into an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.",Fortælling om norske nykommere i Amerika #1 & 2,,10/28/25,August 4th 1999,['Per Hansa'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Americana', 'Westerns', 'American']",,9780060931933,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401111215l/57586.jpg,4.01,[],962.0,11.0,,57586.Giants_in_the_Earth,,,,,92.0,5014.0,531,,Harper Perennial Modern Classics,"['1862', '1816', '957', '261', '118']",,,['Dakota Territory (United States)'],,

While mourning the death of her husband, Senior Tissue Engineer, Stephani Robbins, is plagued by recurring visions of a child being locked up in a chicken coop. Meanwhile, someone is sending her creepy love poems, roses, and photos that have been taken without Stephani's knowledge. As more photos appear, the police suspect that Stephani has hired someone to take these photos. She before she can convince the police to take her seriously she is kidnapped. While imprisoned she discovers why she has been having these visions and it is more chilling than she ever imagined. Can she make it out alive?  What some of my beta readers said... Wow! You've got a thriller with a level of horrific reality here. You take the reader inside a perverted serial killer's head and an innocent woman whose life has been ripped from her and whose present season of recovery is being trespassed. You describe the love of an adoring niece for her mourning auntie and this connects the reader to the prologue and adds another level of emotion to this already captivating plot. What a book!  I have to say 'wow' because your writing style is so picturesque. You show a every detail to plainly. I was captured right away. The showing is real and to telling, which is a top virtue in any real book. The main character Stephanie has a sassy attitude underneath all of the hurt. Her story is heart breaking and so deep I felt her agony. This is a worthy read.  O.N. Stefan, this one is so chilling and well written. The villain jumps off the page at the reader and scare the bejeebers out of you. You descriptions of the lab scene in the first chapter are right on and her getting the poem was quite spooky. The conflict of the mother and Puddles was well done showing just the type of upbringing or lack of this man had. High stars!  I think you have a great novel here. The prologue is intense and urged me to keep reading, as well as setting the stage for when she discovers the pictures to give a sensation of malice. Your voice is exciting and the dialogue is good.

Ocean Vuong,On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,,English,,"Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling.On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are.

Oliver Burkeman,The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking,,English,,"A witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive read that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.The Antidote is a series of journeys among people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that it's our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative ""negative path"" to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clients' lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes we've made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the ""backwards"" business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a company's future.

Oliver Galang (Goodreads Author),Becoming a Superhero: Based on a True Story,,English,,"Oliver was a lost child. Even though he had a good background, he managed to screw up his life. He was a military brat. His father served 24 years in the US Navy. His mom was loving and kind, but very strict. Maybe too much discipline was too much for him?He also had a good education. He was taught in DoDDs (Department of Defense Dependents Schools), similar to private schools, in Portugal and Panama. He even earned a bachelor's degree in Business Management from the renown San Diego State University. However, after all that, it was all downhill.Oliver was a nerd. And he was determined to become a superhero to prove to all the bullies wrong. He worked out hard, even up to five hours a day. He told his psychologist that the reason why he worked out so hard was so he could become a triathlete. However, his real goal was to become a superhero.Unfortunately, Oliver took a wrong path in life. He got mixed up in women, money, and gambling. He had a theory: To think like a criminal, you must act like a criminal.See the adventures of our young superhero as he turns his life around....Chapter 1: BackgroundI was born in the summer of 1974, in a small town near New Orleans, Louisiana. I had big ears, big eyes and a flat nose. I was a scrawny little boy. I’m sure if I was born from Spartan parents, I would’ve easily been thrown off a cliff, as I would’ve been denounced unfit enough to be a Spartan. Luckily, my parents decided to keep me.My parents bestowed upon me the name, “Oliver.” Like Oliver Twist? Yes. However, my name didn’t come from a play. It came from a movie called Love Story. It was my parent’s favorite movie back in 1974, and starred Ryan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw. In this movie, Ryan O’Neal played a character named Oliver. Oliver was an intelligent and handsome guy. Unfortunately, my story is a little different.My dad was a cook or MS (Mess Specialist) in the US Navy. He was an enlisted man, not an officer. He always told me, “If you ever join the military, then become an officer. Don’t be enlisted like me.” He was rather intelligent. However, the only job he could get back then was a cook.You see, in 1947, the US had a huge base called Subic Bay in the Philippines. The US signed a Status of Forces agreement which required the United States to hire Filipinos. Out of the thousands of Filipinos who took the test, my dad was one of the very few who passed it and was recruited into the US Navy. Of course, the only jobs the US allowed the Filipinos to take were cooks. That’s why you will see a lot of old Filipino cooks in the Navy.My dad had a hard life in the Philippines. He used to tell me every day how lucky I was to be born in America. He used to tell me how he collected coins in the ditches and cans on the street to support his family. He told me several times that if he hadn’t passed that test, I would’ve been collecting cans too.I knew I was very fortunate. However, I used to joke around with him all the time saying, “Did it snow in the Philippines too?”He used to get mad at me all the time for saying that. He would always say that it was no laughing matter. Although I apologized many times, I still didn’t believe he walked ten miles to school and back…barefoot! All joking aside, I knew he had a hard life in the Philippines. With that being said, I just wanted to say that I am truly proud to be an American. I couldn’t imagine my life otherwise…much less collecting cans in the ditches.However, although I am an American, I am also known as a Second Generation Filipino, meaning my parents were born in the Philippines and I was born here, in the US. Luckily I was born here, in the US, because if I was born in the Philippines, I would’ve been considered very poor. And even though I’m Filipino…I don’t speak the “Tagalog” language.",,,,October 4th 2012,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir']",,9781479231188,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349954857l/16080113.jpg,3.82,[],42.0,1.0,,16080113-becoming-a-superhero,,,,,84.0,97.0,282,,,"['38', '25', '18', '11', '5']",,,[],,
"Oliver Goldsmith, Arthur Friedman (Editor), Robert L. Mack (Editor)",The Vicar of Wakefield,,English,,"Oliver Goldsmith's hugely successful novel of 1766 remained for generations one of the most highly regarded and beloved works of eighteenth-century fiction. It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships.New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L. Mack that examines the reasons for the novels enduring popularity, as well as the critical debates over whether it is a straightforward novel of sentiment or a satire on the social and economic inequalities of the period and the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody. This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766.",,Oxford World's Classics,10/30/66,June 15th 2006,"['Revd.

Titanic-Chefredakteur, Musicalschreiber, diverse Buchveröffentlichungen im Dunstkreis der Neuen Frankfurter Schule. Nachdem er „die Schnauze voll“ hatte, wie die Klappentext-Bio verkündet, besann Schmitt sich auf eine lang zurückliegende Episode seines Lebens, die wilden Jahre in seiner Heilbronner Punkband „Tiefschlag“. Da man, obgleich man inzwischen saturiert auf eine gänzlich unpunkige Erfolgsbilanz zurückblicken kann, im Herzen immer Punk geblieben ist, nennt OMS seine Spurensuche nach der fiktiven „Gruppe Senf“ und ihrer hübschen Sängerin Itty Lunatic einen „Punkroman für die besseren Kreise.“ Willkommen also im Club der wilden Dichter Jaud, Illies, Lottmann und Co. Peter Julius Hein (Schmitt himself) und Dr. Hollenbach, weder als Drummer Hollo noch als Arzt sonderlich respektabel, geraten auf eine Revival-Tour der seltsamen Art. Bodo, der Ex-Bassist, residiert inzwischen als bräsiger Immobilien-Mensch in einer Protzvilla mit Überwachungskameras in bester Stuttgarter Hanglage.

Brackinger Backhausfeschtle, jenem magischen Ortstermin, bei dem Hein seiner Itty auf offener Bühne seine Liebe erklärte.

During the last few months of his life, he wrote a set of essays in which he movingly explored his feelings about completing a life and coming to terms with his own death. “It is the fate of every human being,” Sacks writes, “to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.”Together, these four essays form an ode to the uniqueness of each human being and to gratitude for the gift of life.",,,11/19/15,November 24th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Science', 'Death']",,9780345811363,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445791421l/27161964.jpg,4.16,[],95.0,1.0,,27161964-gratitude,,,,,96.0,15734.0,49,,Knopf Canada,"['6651', '5838', '2591', '475', '179']",,,[],,

"Oliver Stone, Peter Kuznick",The Untold History of The United States,,English,,"The companion to the Showtime documentary series, director Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick challenge the prevailing orthodoxies of traditional history books in this thoroughly researched and rigorously analyzed look at the dark side of American history.The notion of American exceptionalism, dating back to John Winthrop’s 1630 sermon aboard the Arbella, still warps Americans’ understanding of their nation’s role in the world. Most are loathe to admit that the United States has any imperial pretensions. But history tells a different story as filmmaker Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick reveal in this riveting account of the rise and decline of the American empire.Aided by the latest archival findings and recently declassified documents and building on the research of the world’s best scholars, Stone and Kuznick construct an often shocking but meticulously documented “People’s History of the American Empire” that offers startling context to the Bush-Cheney policies that put us at war in two Muslim countries and show us why the Obama administration has had such a difficult time cleaving a new path.Stone and Kuznick will introduce readers to a pantheon of heroes and villains as they show not only how far the United States has drifted from its democratic traditions, but the powerful forces that have struggled to get us back on track.The authors reveal that:· The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were militarily unnecessary and morally indefensible.· The United States, not the Soviet Union, bore the lion’s share of responsibility for perpetuating the Cold War.· The U.S. love affair with right-wing dictators has gone as far as overthrowing elected leaders, arming and training murderous military officers, and forcing millions of people into poverty.· U.S.-funded Islamist fundamentalists, who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, have blown back to threaten the interests of the U.S. and its allies.· U.S. presidents, especially in wartime, have frequently trampled on the constitution and international law.· The United States has brandished nuclear threats repeatedly and come terrifyingly close to nuclear war.American leaders often believe they are unbound by history, yet Stone and Kuznick argue that we must face our troubling history honestly and forthrightly in order to set a new course for the twenty-first century. Their conclusions will challenge even experts, but there is one question only readers can answer: Is it too late for America to change?",,,,October 30th 2012,[],ebook,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American History', 'The United States Of America', 'Historical', 'American', 'United States', 'War', 'Economics']",,9781451616446,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382220544l/11609409.jpg,4.2,[],99.0,1.0,,11609409-the-untold-history-of-the-united-states,,,,,95.0,2218.0,784,,Gallery Books,"['993', '820', '296', '71', '38']",,,[],,

Olivia Gazalé,Le Mythe de la virilité,,,,"Et si, comme les femmes, les hommes étaient depuis toujours victimes du mythe de la virilité ? De la préhistoire à l'époque contemporaine, une passionnante histoire du féminin et du masculin qui réinterprète de façon originale le thème de la guerre des sexes.  Pour asseoir sa domination sur le sexe féminin, l'homme a, dès les origines de la civilisation, théorisé sa supériorité en construisant le mythe de la virilité. Un discours fondateur qui n'a pas seulement postulé l'infériorité essentielle de la femme, mais aussi celle de l'autre homme (l'étranger, le "" sous-homme "", le "" pédéraste ""...). Historiquement, ce mythe a ainsi légitimé la minoration de la femme et l'oppression de l'homme par l'homme. Depuis un siècle, ce modèle de la toute-puissance guerrière, politique et sexuelle est en pleine déconstruction, au point que certains esprits nostalgiques déplorent une "" crise de la virilité "". Les masculinistes accusent le féminisme d'avoir privé l'homme de sa souveraineté naturelle. Que leur répondre ? Que le malaise masculin est, certes, une réalité, massive et douloureuse, mais que l'émancipation des femmes n'en est pas la cause. La virilité est tombée dans son propre piège, un piège que l'homme, en voulant y enfermer la femme, s'est tendu à lui-même. En faisant du mythe de la supériorité mâle le fondement de l'ordre social, politique, religieux, économique et sexuel, en valorisant la force, le goût du pouvoir, l'appétit de conquête et l'instinct guerrier, il a justifié et organisé l'asservissement des femmes, mais il s'est aussi condamné à réprimer ses émotions, à redouter l'impuissance et à honnir l'effémination, tout en cultivant le goût de la violence et de la mort héroïque. Le devoir de virilité est un fardeau, et "" devenir un homme "" un processus extrêmement coûteux. Si la virilité est aujourd'hui un mythe crépusculaire, il ne faut pas s'en alarmer, mais s'en réjouir. Car la réinvention actuelle des masculinités n'est pas seulement un progrès pour la cause des hommes, elle est l'avenir du féminisme.",,,11/06/17,October 12th 2017,[],Kindle Edition,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Womens']",,B075YZJNJ6,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1510125637l/36556750._SY475_.jpg,4.29,[],68.0,1.0,,36556750-le-mythe-de-la-virilit,,,,,95.0,170.0,416,,Robert Laffont,"['84', '62', '16', '6', '2']",,,[],,

Omar Farhad (Goodreads Author),Honor and Polygamy,,,,"Heartbreaking and timely novel by Afghan-American author follows one man's journey from New York to the clutches of the Taliban and into an unintentional polygamist union. ""He is picking up the same bags with the same clothes Lisa packed and folded a year ago. He wishes he were like his clothes, untouched by external forces."" Family man Nick Blake is living in New York City and working for the United Nations. Born and raised in the United States with broad knowledge of the Afghan culture, he is living the All-American life with his wife, Lisa, and their children. His life is turned upside down when, while on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan, Nick is kidnapped and finds himself in the clutches of the Taliban. Omar Farhad's debut novel Honor and Polygamy follows Nick throughout his eighteen months in Afghanistan and the devastating and unexpected turns his life takes, as he learns the true meanings of home, history and culture. After being held captive for several months, Nick is forced to marry the sixteen-year-old Shaista. Although he cannot forget his beloved wife and children back home, he finds himself falling in love with his second wife and, overwhelmed with guilt, is torn between his old life and his new one. Honor and Polygamy is far from simply a captivating fiction story, but is also a brilliant commentary on the United States' situation with Afghanistan. Farhad expresses his views on both the political and the cultural sides of Afghanistan. Politically, he is predicting how he feels the war will ultimately end, while culturally, he shows readers not familiar with Afghanistan that the 35-year-old war has created a population, which is uneducated, disloyal, and without identity. The United States and many other nations have continuously disrupted Afghanistan with no clear political objectives, and, in his novel, Farhad explores the consequences of these actions. The story of Nick Blake represents the reality of the Afghan culture and the results and disappointments of the political realities in Afghanistan, and shows readers just how unaware we all are of other cultures. Written by an author who has lived both the American and Afghan ways of life, Honor and Polygamy is a harrowing, haunting and deeply moving tale for our times.",,,05/28/14,May 7th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Polygamy']",,9781491732953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400872547l/22242097.jpg,4.24,[],4071.0,43.0,,22242097-honor-and-polygamy,,,,,90.0,156.0,132,,iUniverse,"['91', '36', '13', '8', '8']",,,[],,

Omar Robert Hamilton,The City Always Wins,,,,"
  *** Winner of the Betty Trask Prize 2018 ***
'Omar Robert Hamilton brings vividly to life the failed revolution of 2011 on the streets of Cairo, in all its youthful bravery and naive utopianism.' - JM Coetzee'The City Always Wins is a stirring, clear, humane and immensely savvy novel about political innocence and fearlessness. Its fictive portrayals of the Egyptian 'revolution' of 2011 are nothing less than ground-breaking.' - Richard Ford'I finished this novel with fascination and admiration. It gives a picture of the inside of a popular movement that we all saw from the outside, in countless news broadcasts and foreign-correspondent reports, a picture so vivid and powerful that it gives a passionate life and reality to what might have been perceived only as abstract principles. A thousand vivid details print themselves on the reader's memory: it will be a long time before we read anything so skilfully brought to life.' - Philip Pullman'Few writers could capture the frenetic speed of an Internet-fuelled uprising alongside the time-stopping corporeal reality of bullet-ridden bodies, all while never losing sight of the love that powered Egypt's revolutionary moment. Omar Robert Hamilton can do all that and more. Crossing borders and generations, he brings us into the movement's effervescent hope and its crushing heartbreak, probing timeless questions about what the living owe to the dead. Unbearable. Unmissable. A dazzling debut.' - Naomi Klein'From the chaos and torment of a revolution, and the perpetual struggle with despotism, Omar Robert Hamilton has drawn a novel of great emotional and intellectual power. The City Always Wins is a rare fiction that reminds us, with its wisdom about violence and inequality, grief and loss, how politics is for many today a way to live - and die.' - Pankaj Mishra'The hope, the excitement, the arrogance, the disillusionment, the renewal of hope - this novel is fast, thought-provoking, and hugely entertaining.' - Roddy Doyle***We've been doing the same thing for hundreds of years. Marching, fighting, chanting, dying, changing, winning, losing . This time will be different. This time the future can still be made new.This is a revolution. On the streets of Cairo, a violent uprising is transforming the course of modern history. Mariam and Khalil, two young activists, are swept up in the political fervour. Their lives will never be the same again. Brave, visceral, and electric with tension, Omar Robert Hamilton's debut novel uniquely captures the feverish intensity of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. From the euphoria of mass protests to the chilling silence of the morgue, The City Always Wins is the only novel that allows readers to pierce to the bloody heart of the uprising. Intensely lyrical, yet uncompromisingly political, Omar Robert Hamilton's writing is set to become the defining voice of a revolution that promised so much to so many.",,,06/13/17,August 1st 2017,[],Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Egypt', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'Politics', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Unfinished', 'Cultural', 'Modern']",,9780374123970,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1496430853l/35288461._SY475_.jpg,3.9,['Betty Trask Prize (2018)'],64.0,1.0,,35288461-the-city-always-wins,,,,,92.0,666.0,321,,Faber & Faber,"['198', '262', '153', '47', '6']",,,['Cairo (Egypt)'],,

Onyeka,"Blackamoores: Africans in Tudor England, Their Presence, Status and Origins",,English,,"Do we imagine English history as a book with white pages and no black letters in? We sometimes think of Tudor England in terms of gaudy costumes, the court of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I and perhaps Shakespearian romance. Onyeka's book acknowledges this predilection but challenges our perceptions. Onyeka's book is about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England. In it Onyeka argues that these people were present in cities and towns throughout England, but that they did not automatically occupy the lowest positions in Tudor society. This is important because the few modern historians who have written about Africans in Tudor England suggest that they were all slaves, or transient immigrants who were considered as dangerous strangers and the epitome of otherness. However, this book will show that some Africans in England had important occupations in Tudor society, and were employed by powerful people because of the skills they possessed. These people seem to have inherited some of their skills from the multicultural societies that they came from, but that does not mean all of those present in England were born in other countries: some were born in England. The arguments in this book are supported by evidence from a variety of sources both manuscript and printed, most of which has not been widely discussed - whilst some of it Onyeka has discovered, and this may be the first time that it has been revealed. Other evidence is taken from texts that are the subject of popular discussion by historians, linguists and so on, but Onyeka encourages the reader to re-examine these works in a different way because they reveal information about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England.",,1,10/28/13,September 16th 2013,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Anti Racist', 'Historical', 'World History', 'British Literature', 'Cultural', 'Research', 'European History']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384945566l/18869947.jpg,4.35,[],800.0,8.0,,18869947-blackamoores,,,,,95.0,80.0,463,,Narrative Eye Ltd,"['47', '20', '9', '2', '2']",,,['England'],,

"Opal Whiteley, Benjamin Hoff (Editor)",The Singing Creek Where the Willows Grow,,English,,"Long before environmental consciousness became popular, a young nature writer named Opal Whiteley captured America's heart. Opal's childhood diary, published in 1902, became an immediate bestseller, one of the most talked-about books of its time.

Condemning it as an adult-written hoax, skeptics stirred a scandal that drove the book into obscurity and shattered the frail spirit of its author.Discovering the diary by chance, bestselling author Benjamin Hoff set out to solve the longstanding mystery of its origin.

Orhan Pamuk,Istanbul: Memories and the City,,English,,"A shimmering evocation, by turns intimate and panoramic, of one of the world’s great cities, by its foremost writer. Orhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul and still lives in the family apartment building where his mother first held him in her arms. His portrait of his city is thus also a self-portrait, refracted by memory and the melancholy–or–hüzün–that all Istanbullus share: the sadness that comes of living amid the ruins of a lost empire. With cinematic fluidity, Pamuk moves from his glamorous, unhappy parents to the gorgeous, decrepit mansions overlooking the Bosphorus; from the dawning of his self-consciousness to the writers and painters–both Turkish and foreign–who would shape his consciousness of his city.

Again and again Pamuk declares his faith in fiction, engaging the work of such predecessors as Laurence Sterne and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, sharing fragments from his notebooks, and commenting on his own novels. He contemplates his mysterious compulsion to sit alone at a desk and dream, always returning to the rich deliverance that is reading and writing.By turns witty, moving, playful, and provocative, Other Colors glows with the energy of a master at work and gives us the world through his eyes, assigning every radiant theme and shifting mood its precise shade in the spectrum of significance.",,First United States Edition,10/29/99,September 18th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Turkish Literature', 'Turkish', 'Nobel Prize', 'Biography', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780307266750,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348580856l/384221.jpg,3.92,[],196.0,2.0,,384221.Other_Colors,,,,,94.0,2037.0,448,,Knopf,"['569', '892', '451', '101', '24']",,,[],,
"Orhan Pamuk, Maureen Freely (Translator)",The Museum of Innocence,,English,,"“It was the happiest moment of my life, though I didn’t know it.” So begins the new novel, his first since winning the Nobel Prize, from the universally acclaimed author of Snow and My Name Is Red. It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal, scion of one of the city’s wealthiest families, is about to become engaged to Sibel, daughter of another prominent family, when he encounters Füsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation. Once the long-lost cousins violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeosie—a world, as he lovingly describes it, with opulent parties and clubs, society gossip, restaurant rituals, picnics, and mansions on the Bosphorus, infused with the melancholy of decay—until finally he breaks off his engagement to Sibel. But his resolve comes too late. For eight years Kemal will find excuses to visit another Istanbul, that of the impoverished backstreets where Füsun, her heart now hardened, lives with her parents, and where Kemal discovers the consolations of middle-class life at a dinner table in front of the television. His obsessive love will also take him to the demimonde of Istanbul film circles (where he promises to make Füsun a star), a scene of seedy bars, run-down cheap hotels, and small men with big dreams doomed to bitter failure. In his feckless pursuit, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress and his afflicted heart’s reactions: anger and impatience, remorse and humiliation, deluded hopes of recovery, and daydreams that transform Istanbul into a cityscape of signs and specters of his beloved, from whom now he can extract only meaningful glances and stolen kisses in cars, movie houses, and shadowy corners of parks. A last change to realize his dream will come to an awful end before Kemal discovers that all he finally can possess, certainly and eternally, is the museum he has created of his collection, this map of a society’s manners and mores, and of one man’s broken heart.A stirring exploration of the nature of romantic attachment and of the mysterious allure of collecting, The Museum of Innocence also plumbs the depths of an Istanbul half Western and half traditional—its emergent modernity, its vast cultural history.

"Orhan Pamuk, Maureen Freely (Translator)",Snow,,English,,"One of multiple covers for ISBN 9780375706868.A spellbinding tale of disparate yearnings – for love, art, power, and God – set in a remote Turkish town, where stirrings of political Islamism threaten to unravel the secular order; by the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature.From the acclaimed author of My Name Is Red comes a spellbinding tale of disparate yearnings–for love, art, power, and God–set in a remote Turkish town, where stirrings of political Islamism threaten to unravel the secular order. Following years of lonely political exile in Western Europe, Ka, a middle-aged poet, returns to Istanbul to attend his mother's funeral. Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer's curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka's motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka's youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka's frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration.

In the 17th century, a young Italian scholar sailing from Venice to Naples is taken prisoner and delivered to Constantinople. There he falls into the custody of a scholar known as Hoja--""master""--a man who is his exact double. In the years that follow, the slave instructs his master in Western science and technology, from medicine to pyrotechnics.

"Ori Brafman (Goodreads Author), Rod A. Beckstrom",The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations,,English,,"If you cut off a spider’s leg, it’s crippled; if you cut off its head, it dies. But if you cut off a starfish’s leg it grows a new one, and the old leg can grow into an entirely new starfish.What’s the hidden power behind the success of Wikipedia, Craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women’s rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could have made?After five years of ground-breaking research, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections. The Starfish and the Spider argues that organizations fall into two categories: traditional “spiders,” which have a rigid hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary “starfish,” which rely on the power of peer relationships.The Starfish and the Spider explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the US government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success. The book explores:* How the Apaches fended off the powerful Spanish army for 200 years* The power of a simple circle* The importance of catalysts who have an uncanny ability to bring people together * How the Internet has become a breeding ground for leaderless organizations* How Alcoholics Anonymous has reached untold millions with only a shared ideology and without a leaderThe Starfish and the Spider is the rare book that will change how you understand the world around you.",,,10/30/06,October 5th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Leadership', 'Nonfiction', 'Management', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural', 'Psychology', 'Sociology']",,9781591841432,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435357582l/21314._SY475_.jpg,3.87,[],99.0,1.0,,21314.The_Starfish_and_the_Spider,,,,,91.0,4745.0,230,,Portfolio,"['1458', '1712', '1165', '299', '111']",,,[],,

Prima il Vietnam, poi Città del Messico e infine la storia d’amore con Alekos Panagulis, eroe della Resistenza greca, simbolo dell’opposizione a qualunque regime liberticida. Dopo la morte di lui e la pubblicazione di Un uomo, Oriana riesce a creare un incantamento globale: vorrebbero essere come lei i tanti giovani e meno giovani attratti dalla personalità dei suoi reportage di guerra e dal suo coraggio. E vorrebbero essere come lei molte donne, per le quali la scrittrice rappresenta la realizzazione di un sogno. In quegli anni la Fallaci accetta i sempre più frequenti inviti a incontrare i suoi lettori stranieri, nelle città e nelle università del mondo. Questo libro raccoglie alcune delle sue conferenze di maggior rilievo, pagine rimaste finora inedite che rivelano il suo rapporto con la scrittura, la sua passione per la politica e per l’impegno civile, la sua “ossessione per la libertà”. È il suo autoritratto più autentico, una sorta di manifesto in cui Oriana rivendica e difende con vigore il diritto a “stare dalla parte dell’umanità, suggerire i cambiamenti, innamorarci dei buoni cambiamenti, influenzare un futuro che sia un futuro migliore del presente”.",,Opere di Oriana Fallaci,,January 2013,[],Hardcover,[],,9788817061278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357986366l/17234935.jpg,4.19,[],97.0,1.0,,17234935-il-mio-cuore-pi-stanco-della-mia-voce,,,,,99.0,70.0,208,,Rizzoli,"['26', '32', '11', '1', '0']",,,[],,

It is the tragic monologue of a woman speaking with the child she carries in her womb. This letter confronts the burning theme of abortion, and the meaning of life, by asking difficult questions: Is it fair to impose life even if it means suffering? Would it be better not to be born at all?Letter to a Child Never Born touches on the real meaning of being a woman: the power to give life or not. When the book begins, the protagonist is upset after learning she is pregnant. She knows nothing about the child, except that this creature depends totally and uniquely on her own choices. The creation of another person directly within one’s own body is a very shocking thing. The sense of responsibility is huge; it is a heavy burden that gives life to endless reflections, from the origin of our existence to the shame of our selfishness. If the child could choose, would he prefer to be born, to grow up, and to suffer, or would he return to the joyful limbo from which he came?

Pero la anécdota y el paisaje que pone en escena el periodista, crítico y narrador hincado en la melancolía andina, se detiene en el merodeo infinito del instante, como i cada presente, cada estampa, expresara una esencia eterna que exhibe pausadamente sus reiterados detalles, a través de muchas voces que se relevan para hacer penetrar en el relato la geografía o la historia, como un mosaico de tiempos, espacios y pensamientos.

Orlando Figes,A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution: 1891-1924,,English,,"
  It is history on an epic yet human scale. Vast in scope, exhaustive in original research, written with passion, narrative skill, and human sympathy, A People's Tragedy is a profound account of the Russian Revolution for a new generation. Many consider the Russian Revolution to be the most significant event of the twentieth century. Distinguished scholar Orlando Figes presents a panorama of Russian society on the eve of that revolution, and then narrates the story of how these social forces were violently erased. Within the broad stokes of war and revolution are miniature histories of individuals, in which Figes follows the main players' fortunes as they saw their hopes die and their world crash into ruins. Unlike previous accounts that trace the origins of the revolution to overreaching political forces and ideals, Figes argues that the failure of democracy in 1917 was deeply rooted in Russian culture and social history and that what had started as a people's revolution contained the seeds of its degeneration into violence and dictatorship. A People's Tragedy is a masterful and original synthesis by a mature scholar, presented in a compelling and accessibly human narrative.

Now, in Natasha's Dance, internationally renowned historian Orlando Figes does the same for Russian culture, summoning the myriad elements that formed a nation and held it together.Beginning in the eighteenth century with the building of St. Petersburg-a ""window on the West""-and culminating with the challenges posed to Russian identity by the Soviet regime, Figes examines how writers, artists, and musicians grappled with the idea of Russia itself-its character, spiritual essence, and destiny. He skillfully interweaves the great works-by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall-with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world. Figes's characters range high and low: the revered Tolstoy, who left his deathbed to search for the Kingdom of God, as well as the serf girl Praskovya, who became Russian opera's first superstar and shocked society by becoming her owner's wife.

Orna Donath,Regretting Motherhood,,English,,"Women who opt not to be mothers are frequently warned that they will regret their decision later in life, yet we rarely talk about the possibility that the opposite might also be true—that a woman who becomes a mother might regret it. Sociologist Orna Donath dispels the silence around this profoundly taboo subject in a powerful work that draws from her years of research interviewing women who wish they had never become mothers.Donath treats regret as a feminist issue: as regret marks the road not taken, we need to consider whether alternative paths for women may currently be blocked off. Donath asks that we pay attention to what is forbidden by our contemporary rules governing motherhood, time, and emotion, including the cultural assumption that motherhood is a “natural” role for women—for the sake of all women, not just those who regret becoming mothers. Donath finds that the women in her study became mothers for a wide variety of reasons: some did so to avoid divorce, exclusion from their family, or alienation from their friends; others did not think about it at all, but accepted it as the “next step” of what society considers to be a normal and natural life course. Others experienced regret despite initially having an strong desire to become mothers. Though they may love their children, these women each describe the agonizing guilt and suffering they have experienced as a result of becoming mothers, and consider the different ways they have each come to recognize and deal with these conflicts.",,,,July 11th 2017,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Parenting', 'Sociology', 'Womens', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Society', 'Self Help', 'Gender']",,9781623171377,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499207153l/32302223.jpg,4.08,[],97.0,1.0,,32302223-regretting-motherhood,,,,,96.0,822.0,243,,North Atlantic Books,"['300', '330', '158', '24', '10']",,,[],,

Orson Scott Card,First Meetings,In Ender's Universe,,Young Adult Fiction,"Welcome to the Enderverse. When ""Ender's Game"" was first published as a novella twenty-five years ago few would have predicted that it would become one of the most successful ventures in publishing history. Expanded into a novel in 1985, Ender's Game won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best Novel. Never out of print and translated into dozens of languages, it is the rare work of fiction that can truly be said to have transcended a genre. Ender's Game and its sequels have won dozens of prestigious awards and are as popular today among teens and young readers as adults. First Meetings is a collection of three novellas-plus the original ""Ender's Game""-that journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. ""The Polish Boy"" begins in the wake between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wiggin-the future father of Ender -they believe they may have found their man. Or boy. In ""Teacher's Pest""-a novella written especially for this collection-a brilliant but insufferably arrogant John Paul Wiggin, now an American university student, matches wits with an equally brilliant graduate student named Theresa Brown. It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in ""The Investment Counselor."" Ender's reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, twenty-year-old Andrew Wiggin wanders incognito from planet to planet as a fugitive. Until a blackmailing tax inspector compromises his identity and threatens to expose Ender the Xenocide. Also reprinted here is the original landmark novella, ""Ender's Game,"" which first appeared in 1977. Fully illustrated, First Meetings is Orson Scott Card writing at the height of his considerable power about his most compelling character.

Orson Scott Card,Magic Street,,English,,"Orson Scott Card has the distinction of having swept both the Hugo and Nebula awards in two consecutive years with his amazing novels Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead. For a body of work that ranges from science fiction to nonfiction to plays, Card has been recognized as an author who provides vivid, colorful glimpses between the world we know and worlds we can only imagine.In a peaceful, prosperous African American neighborhood in Los Angeles, Mack Street is a mystery child who has somehow found a home. Discovered abandoned in an overgrown park, raised by a blunt-speaking single woman, Mack comes and goes from family to family–a boy who is at once surrounded by boisterous characters and deeply alone. But while Mack senses that he is different from most, and knows that he has strange powers, he cannot possibly understand how unusual he is until the day he sees, in a thin slice of space, a narrow house. Beyond it is a backyard–and an entryway into an extraordinary world stretching off into an exotic distance of geography, history, and magic.Passing through the skinny house that no one else can see, Mack is plunged into a realm where time and reality are skewed, a place where what Mack does and sees seem to have strange affects in the “real world” of concrete, cars, commerce, and conflict. Growing into a tall, powerful young man, pursuing a forbidden relationship, and using Shakespeare’s Midsummer’s Night Dream as a guide into the vast, timeless fantasy world, Mack becomes a player in an epic drama. Understanding this drama is Mack’s challenge. His reward, if he can survive the trip, is discovering not only who he really is . . . but why he exists.Both a novel of constantly surprising entertainment and a tale of breathtaking literary power, Magic Street is a masterwork from a supremely gifted, utterly original American writer–a novel that uses realism and fantasy to delight, challenge, and satisfy on the most profound levels.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/01/05,June 27th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Paranormal', 'Adult']",,9780345416902,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320474578l/7964.jpg,3.25,[],87.0,2.0,,7964.Magic_Street,,,,,78.0,5699.0,416,,Del Rey,"['685', '1594', '2185', '905', '330']",,,[],,

But things were quiet now, had been quiet for a year, and it was plain to him now that they would not bring him back at all, that he was much more useful as a name and a story than he would ever be as an inconvenient flesh-and-blood person.At the close of Ender's Game, Andrew Wiggin--called Ender by everyone--knows that he cannot live on Earth. He has become far more than just a boy who won a game: He is the Savior of Earth, a hero, a military genius whose allegiance is sought by every nation of the newly shattered Earth Hegemony.He is offered the choice of living under the Hegemon's control, a pawn in his brother Peter's political games. Or he can join the colony ships and go out to settle one of the new worlds won in the war.The story of those years on the colony worlds has never been told...until now.The voyage was long. By the end of it, Val had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, back to Earth, and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers. They knew him now, and he had won their love and their respect.Ender was twelve when he chose to leave his home world and begin the long relativistic journey out to the colonies. With him went his sister, Valentine, and the core of the artificial intelligence that would become Jane. He wrote The Hive Queen and The Hegemon, and his sister wrote The Speaker for the Dead.He served as governor of his first colony world, but now Ender is on the move, looking for a planet where the hive queens might be reestablished.What he finds in the Ganges colony is more than he bargained for--a resentful governor who caused a devastating war on Earth and a brilliant young colonist who is out to destroy him, starting with his reputation and ending, perhaps, with his life.",Enderverse: Publication Order #11,,,November 11th 2008,"['Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Andrew Wiggin']",Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Aliens']",,9780765304964,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442883678l/3220405._SX318_.jpg,3.91,[],663.0,7.0,,3220405-ender-in-exile,,,,,94.0,44894.0,369,,St. Martins Press-3PL,"['12882', '18017', '11396', '2108', '491']",,,[],,

  The mining ship El Cavador is far out from Earth, in the deeps of the Kuiper Belt, beyond Pluto. Other mining ships, and the families that live on them, are few and far between this far out. So when El Cavador's telescopes pick up a fast-moving object coming in-system, it's hard to know what to make of it. It's massive and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.El Cavador has other problems. Their systems are old and failing. The family is getting too big for the ship. There are claim-jumping corporate ships bringing Asteroid Belt tactics to the Kuiper Belt. Worrying about a distant object that might or might not be an alien ship seems not important.They're wrong. It's the most important thing that has happened to the human race in a million years. The first Formic War is about to begin.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com",Ender's Saga #1,Unabridged,10/28/85,09/30/04,"['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']",Audiobook,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']",,9780812550702,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg,4.3,"['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'Nébula (1985)', 'Margaret A.

"Osama bin Laden, Bruce B. Lawrence",Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama Bin Laden,,English,,"Despite the saturation of global media coverage, Osama bin Laden’s own writings have been curiously absent from analysis of the “war on terror.” Over the last ten years, bin Laden has issued a series of carefully tailored public statements, from interviews with Western and Arabic journalists to faxes and video recordings. These texts supply evidence crucial to an understanding of the bizarre mix of Quranic scholarship, CIA training, punctual interventions in Gulf politics and messianic anti-imperialism that has formed the programmatic core of Al Qaeda.In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden’s name since 1994, this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network. Newly translated from the Arabic, annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence, this collection places the statements in their religious, historical and political context. It shows how bin Laden’s views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency, and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group, and over his own role in terrorist attacks, have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology.",,,,November 17th 2005,"['George W.

"Osamu Tezuka, Camellia Nieh (Translator)",Ode to Kirihito,,English,,"It may or may not be contagious. There seems to be no cure for it. Yet, Monmow Disease, a life-threatening condition that transforms a person into a dog-like beast, is not the only villain in this shocking triumph of a medical thriller by manga-god Osamu Tezuka. Said to have been the personal favorite of the artist, who held a degree in medicine, and surprisingly attentive to Christian themes and imagery, Ode to Kirihito demolishes naive notions about human nature and health and likely preconceptions about the comics master himself.From pregnant vistas of the Japanese countryside to closed rooms full of sin and redemption, Tezuka astounds for more than eight hundred continuous pages, his art in turn easefully concise and flamboyantly experimental, his inquiry into our most repugnant instincts and prospects for overcoming them unflinchingly serious. Incorporating elements of the often lurid and adult-oriented “gekiga” style for the first time, Tezuka entered into his fruitful late period with this work.A promising young doctor, Kirihito Osanai visits a remote Japanese mountain village to investigate the source of the latest medical mystery. While he ends up traveling the world to discover what it takes to be cured of such a disease, a conspiracy back home attempts to explain away his absence. Hinging upon his fate are those of his loved ones: an unstable childhood friend and colleague trapped between factions of the medical establishment that nurtured him; a fiancée emotionally transformed by Kirihito’s mysterious disappearance; and a stranger who becomes his guardian angel, a sensual circus-act performer with volatile psychological secrets. From plutocratic Taipei and racially divided South Africa to backwater Arabia and modern Osaka, ambition and desire beckon “normal men” to behave uglier than any beast. Riveting our attention on deformity and its acceptance like The Elephant Man by David Lynch, Ode to Kirihito examines the true worth of human beings through and beyond appearances.",Kirihito #1-4,,10/30/71,October 24th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Manga', 'Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Horror', 'Seinen', 'Science Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Sequential Art']",,9781932234640,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327882140l/209571.jpg,4.06,[],96.0,1.0,,209571.Ode_to_Kirihito,,,,,93.0,1730.0,832,,Vertical,"['673', '627', '310', '95', '25']",,,[],,

"Osamu Tezuka, Kumar Sivasubramanian (Goodreads Author) (Translator)","Message to Adolf, Part 1",,English,,"It is 1936 in Berlin, Nazi Germany. A Japanese reporter named Sohei Tohge is covering the Berlin Olympic Games for the Japanese press. As he sits in the Japanese press box watching the many track and field events of the day, he receives a call from his younger brother Isao, who has been studying in Germany as an international student. The two make plans to meet as Isao mentions he has something of importance to share with his sibling. While Sohei initially thinks his little brother may have found a young frau, Isao's tone is clearly that of one who is troubled by topics much heavier than romance. When Sohei arrives at Berlin University, he finds his brother's room has been through some sort of violent ordeal. A mysterious message was left on a note pad and a window was left wide open. And tangled in the branches of a tree directly below Isao's window rested his dead body. Isao was murdered. Sohei would immediately launch an investigation to the murder, but almost instantly all traces of information regarding his younger brother's study in Germany has vanished. The police were of no help. Isao's room was also cleared and rented out to another person. Even his building manager feined ignorance. It was as if he had never existed. Investigating the matter, it is later learned that this murder is connected to a document he mailed to Japan with information regarding Adolf Hitler.

"Osamu Tezuka, Mari Morimoto (Translator)",Ayako,,English,,"Long considered as one of Osamu Tezuka’s most political narratives, Ayako is also considered to be one of his most challenging as it defies the conventions of his manga by utilizing a completely original cast and relying solely on historical drama to drive the plot.  Ayako, pulls no punches, and does not allow for gimmicks as science-fiction or fantasy may.  Instead Tezuka weaves together a tale which its core simply focuses on a single family, a family that could be considered a metaphor for a rapidly developing superpower.Overflowing with imagery of the cold war seen through Japan’s eyes, Ayako is firmly set in realism taking inspiration from a number of historical events that occurred over the American occupation and the cultural-revolution which soon followed. Believed to be Tezuka’s answer to the gekiga (dramatic comics) movement of the 60’s, Ayako should be considered one of the better early examples of a seinen (young adult) narrative to be published.Initially set in the aftermath of World War II, Ayako focuses its attention on the Tenge clan, a once powerful family of landowners living in a rural community in northern Japan.  From the moment readers are introduced to the extended family, it is apparent that the war and American occupation have begun to erode the fabric that binds them all together.  The increasing influence of political, economic and social change begins to tear into the many Tenge siblings, while a strange marriage agreement creates resentment between the eldest son and his sire.  And when the family seems to have completely fallen apart, they decide to turn their collective rage on what they believe to be the source of their troubles—the newest member of the Tenge family, the youngest sister Ayako.",Ayako #1-3,,,November 30th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Manga', 'Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Japan', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Seinen', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Asia']",,9781934287514,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358020666l/7631912.jpg,3.93,[],27.0,1.0,,7631912-ayako,,,,,93.0,1468.0,704,,Vertical,"['457', '584', '317', '90', '20']",,,[],,

Oscar Wilde;Andrew Elfenbein,Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray,,,Fiction,"From Longman's new Cultural Editions Series, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, edited by Andrew Elfenbein, includes the novel and contextual materials from the era of Oscar Wilde. This edition of Oscar Wilde's classic work, The Picture of Dorian Gray, highlights the novel's modernity in both its form and its revolutionary content, and traces its links to modernist literature and the culture of modernity alike. Previous editions of the novel have only seen it in a late Victorian context, or as an extension of the aesthetic theories of Walter Pater and the ""art for art's sake"" movement. As presented in this new edition, however, the freshness and originality of the book emerges, along with its strong social messages. The book is a pastiche of genres that propels nineteenth-century realism into twentieth-century modernism ahead of its own time. Wilde's novel offers a myth for modernity whose hold on the cultural imagination has only strengthened over time-Dorian Gray's uncanny bond with his own portrait underscores the loss of selfhood everyone experiences in a world of images and copies, paves the way for the discourses of homosexuality and the understanding of lifestyle as identity so current today, and provides clues to the mysteries of modern ethics and politics. The edition also emphasizes the role of gender and the rise of female emancipation underlying the Sybil Vane subplot, a focus on women that intensifies the book's relevance to modern transformations of men and women alike.",,,,2007.0,,,,0321427130,9780321427137,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dhxDPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.07,,,,,,,,,,,,352.0,,,,119.0,,,,

Osho,Awareness: The Key to Living in Balance,,,,"Underlying all meditation techniques, including martial arts-and in fact underlying all great athletic performances-is a quality of being awake and present to the moment, a quality that Osho calls awareness. Once we can identify and understand what this quality of awareness is, we have the key to self-mastery in virtually every area of our lives.According to great masters like Lao Tzu or Buddha, most of us move through our lives like sleepwalkers. Never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates us to do and say the things we do.At the same time, all of us have experienced moments of awareness-or awakening, to use another-in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch us deeply-welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or being with someone at the moment of death.Awareness, says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in every aspect of our lives. In this book, Osho teaches how to live life more attentively, mindfully, and meditatively, with love, caring and consciousness.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India.

Osho,Intimacy: Trusting Oneself and the Other,,English,,"""Hit-and-run"" relationships have become common in our society as it has grown more rootless, less tied to traditional family structures, and more accepting of casual sex. But at the same time, there arises an undercurrent of feeling that something is missing-a quality of intimacy.This quality has very little to do with the physical, though sex is certainly one possible door. Far more important is a willingness to expose our deepest feelings and vulnerabilities, with the trust that the other person will treat them with care. Ultimately, the willingness to take the risk of intimacy has to be grounded in an inner strength that knows that even if the other remains closed, even if that trust is betrayed, we will not suffer any permanent damage.In this gentle and compassionate guide, Osho takes his readers step-by-step through what makes people afraid of intimacy, how to encounter those fears and go beyond them, and what they can do to nourish themselves and their relationships to support more openness and trust.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness.

Osho,Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic,,English,,"Intuition deals with the difference between the intellectual, logical mind and the more encompassing realm of spirit.

Osho,Intelligence: The Creative Response to Now,,English,,"In Intelligence, Osho challenges the common conception that the best way to promote intelligence is to train the intellect.

But that morality will have a totally different flavor to it. It will be spontaneous; it will not be ready-made.” –OshoIn a global world, we are in search of universal values—values based on a contemporary understanding that unifies us as human beings beyond the divisions of religions, nations, and race. In Moral, Immoral, Amoral, Osho speaks directly to this contemporary search as he introduces us to a quest for values that make sense in the world we live in—a quest that goes far beyond moral codes of behavior and comes from an inner connectivity and oneness with existence.The Osho Life Essentials series focuses on the most important questions in the life of the individual.

Osvaldo Bayer,La Patagonia rebelde,,Spanish,,"La Patagonia rebelde no es solo el testimonio de la virulenta represión y matanza de obreros en las huelgas patagónicas de 1921, es también una radiografía cruda y descarnada de la desigualdad humana. Esta obra prueba en forma contundente la lógica de un sistema perverso, en el cual los estancieros latifundistas de la Patagonia, verdaderos instigadores e interesados en aniquilar a los huelguistas, presionaron al gobierno de Yrigoyen y al ejército para que termine definitivamente con esos ""rotosos sublevados"". El teniente coronel Varela no dudó y mandó a jóvenes soldados, de apenas veinte años, a fusilar sin miramientos a decenas de peones rurales.

She’s young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn’t just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It’s the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong?My Year of Rest and Relaxation is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be.

Otto Rahn,"Crusade Against the Grail: The Struggle between the Cathars, the Templars, and the Church of Rome",,English,,"The first English translation of the book that reveals the Cathar stronghold at Montségur to be the repository of the Holy Grail  • Presents the history of the Papal persecution of the Cathars that lies hidden in the medieval epic Parzival and in the poetry of the troubadours  • Provides new insights into the life and death of this gifted and controversial author  Crusade Against the Grail is the daring book that popularized the legend of the Cathars and the Holy Grail. The first edition appeared in Germany in 1933 and drew upon Rahn’s account of his explorations of the Pyrenean caves where the heretical Cathar sect sought refuge during the 13th century. Over the years the book has been translated into many languages and exerted a large influence on such authors as Trevor Ravenscroft and Jean-Michel Angebert, but it has never appeared in English until now.  Much as German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann used Homer’s Iliad to locate ancient Troy, Rahn believed that Wolfram von Eschenbach’s medieval epic Parzival held the keys to the mysteries of the Cathars and the secret location of the Holy Grail. Rahn saw Parzival not as a work of fiction, but as a historical account of the Cathars and the Knights Templar and their guardianship of the Grail, a “stone from the stars.” The Crusade that the Vatican led against the Cathars became a war pitting Roma (Rome) against Amor (love), in which the Church triumphed with flame and sword over the pure faith of the Cathars.",,,,September 22nd 2006,"['Otto Rahn', 'Holy Grail']",Paperback,"['History', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Esoterica', 'Christianity', 'Medieval History', 'Archaeology']",,9781594771354,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397768498l/611582.jpg,3.66,[],69.0,1.0,,611582.Crusade_Against_the_Grail,,,,,87.0,159.0,256,,Inner Traditions,"['45', '42', '51', '15', '6']",,,['Montségur'],,
Otto Rahn,Lucifer's Court: A Heretic's Journey in Search of the Light Bringers,,English,,"Rahn’s personal diary from his travels as occult investigator for the Third Reich • First English translation of the author’s journeys in search of a Nordic equivalent to Mt. Sinai • Explains why Lucifer the Light Bringer, god of the heretics, is a positive figure Otto Rahn’s lifelong search for the Grail brought him to the attention of the SS leader Himmler, who shared his esoteric interests. Induced by Himmler to become the chief investigator of the occult for the Nazis, Rahn traveled throughout Europe--from Spain to Iceland--in the mid 1930s pursuing leads to the Grail and other mysteries. Lucifer’s Court is the travel diary he kept while searching for “the ghosts of the pagans and heretics who were [his] ancestors.” It was during this time that Rahn grasped the positive role Lucifer plays in these forbidden religions as the bearer of true illumination, similar to Apollo and other sun gods in pagan worship.This journey was also one of self-discovery for Rahn. He found such a faithful echo of his own innermost beliefs in the lives of the heretics of the past that he eventually called himself a Cathar and nurtured ambitions of restoring that faith, which had been cruelly destroyed in the fires of the Inquisition. His journeys on assignment for the Reich--including researching an alleged entrance to Hollow Earth in Iceland and searching for the true mission of Lucifer in the caves of southern France that served as refuge for the Cathars during the Inquisition--also led to his disenchantment with his employers and his mysterious death in the mountains after his break with the Nazis.",,,,February 28th 2008,['Otto Rahn'],Paperback,"['Occult', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'History']",,9781594771972,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391980284l/2425699.jpg,4.01,[],100.0,1.0,,2425699.Lucifer_s_Court,,,,,93.0,146.0,256,,Inner Traditions,"['51', '58', '27', '7', '3']",,,[],,

Ovid,Metamorphoses,,,Science,"Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso, 43 BCE-17 CE), born at Sulmo, studied rhetoric and law at Rome. Later he did considerable public service there, and otherwise devoted himself to poetry and to society. Famous at first, he offended the emperor Augustus by his Ars Amatoria, and was banished because of this work and some other reason unknown to us, and dwelt in the cold and primitive town of Tomis on the Black Sea. He continued writing poetry, a kindly man, leading a temperate life. He died in exile. Ovid's main surviving works are the Metamorphoses, a source of inspiration to artists and poets including Chaucer and Shakespeare; the Fasti, a poetic treatment of the Roman year of which Ovid finished only half; the Amores, love poems; the Ars Amatoria, not moral but clever and in parts beautiful; Heroides, fictitious love letters by legendary women to absent husbands; and the dismal works written in exile: the Tristia, appeals to persons including his wife and also the emperor; and similar Epistulae ex Ponto.

For students of Latin-and teachers, too-they provide an interesting experience. In his introduction the editor discusses Ovid’s career, the reputation of the Metamorphoses during Ovid’s time and after, and the various manuscripts that exist or have been known to exist.

Owen Jones,The Establishment: And How They Get Away with It,,English,,"In The Establishment Owen Jones, author of the international bestseller Chavs, offers a biting critique of the British Establishment and a passionate plea for democracyBehind our democracy lurks a powerful but unaccountable network of people who wield massive power and reap huge profits in the process. In exposing this shadowy and complex system that dominates our lives, Owen Jones sets out on a journey into the heart of our Establishment, from the lobbies of Westminster to the newsrooms, boardrooms and trading rooms of Fleet Street and the City. Exposing the revolving doors that link these worlds, and the vested interests that bind them together, Jones shows how, in claiming to work on our behalf, the people at the top are doing precisely the opposite.

Now, firmly rooted on the shores of his adopted land-where American has taken up arms against American in this most terrible of conflicts-he has signed on as a confidential agent to General George McClellan, the man touted as the savior of the Union. Within hours Jones finds himself in a dark and unexpected world, where questions lead not to answers, but to other deaths Set against the backdrop of battles and bordellos, of the intrigues of war-time Washington and the elegant mansions of old Philadelphia, FADED COAT OF BLUE reaches behind the myths and heroics to paint a ravishing, disturbing and deeply moving portrait of the United States in the midst of our harshest trial.

"Owen Wister, Gary Scharnhorst (Introduction)",The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains,,English,,"In the untamed West, pioneers came to test their fortunes -- and their wills. The Wyoming territory was a harsh, unforgiving land, with its own unwritten code of honor by which men lived and died. Into this rough landscape rides the Virginian, a solitary man whose unbending will is his only guide through life. The Virginian's unwavering beliefs in right and wrong are soon tested as he tries to prove his love for a woman who cannot accept his sense of justice; at the same time, a betrayal by his most trusted friend forces him to fight against the corruption that rules the land. Still as exciting and meaningful as it was when first published one hundred years ago, Owen Wister's epic tale of a man caught between his love for a woman and his quest for justice exemplifies one of the most significant and enduring themes in all of American literature. With remarkable character depth and vivid passages, The Virginian stands not only as the first great novel of American Western literature, but as a testament to the eternal struggle between good and evil in humanity.

Oyama Shiro,A Man with No Talents: Memoirs of a Tokyo Day Laborer,,English,,"San'ya, Tokyo's largest day-laborer quarter and the only one with lodgings, had been Oyama Shiro's home for twelve years when he took up his pen and began writing about his life as a resident of Tokyo's most notorious neighborhood. After completing a university education, Oyama entered the business workforce and appeared destined to walk the same path as many a ""salaryman."" A singular temperament and a deep loathing of conformity, however, altered his career trajectory dramatically. Oyama left his job and moved to Osaka, where he lived for three years. Later he returned to the corporate world but fell out of it again, this time for good. After spending a short time on the streets around Shinjuku, home to Tokyo's bustling entertainment district, he moved to San'ya in 1987, at the age of forty.Oyama acknowledges his eccentricity and his inability to adapt to corporate life. Spectacularly unsuccessful as a salaryman yet uncomfortable in his new surroundings, he portrays himself as an outsider both from mainstream society and from his adopted home. It is precisely this outsider stance, however, at once dispassionate yet deeply engaged, that caught the eye of Japanese readers. The book was published in Japan in 2000 after Oyama had submitted his manuscript on a lark, he confesses for one of Japan's top literary awards, the Kaiko Takeshi Prize. Although he was astounded actually to win the award, Oyama remained in character and elected to preserve the anonymity that has freed him from all social bonds and obligations.
