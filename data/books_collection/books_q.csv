They live in the same house with them, they dream about them every night, they share the same flesh and blood, yet for some reason their parents have never found the time to visit them even once since they were born. Living in a dark corner of their parents' vast crumbling mansion, the children long for the day when they will finally be held in their mother's loving arms for the first time... But that day seems to never come. They worry their parents have long since forgotten about them.  When the machines that provide them with food and water stop functioning, the children are forced to venture out of the nursery to find their parents on their own. But the rest of the house is much larger and stranger than they ever could have imagined. The maze-like hallways are dark and seem to go on forever, deranged creatures lurk in every shadow, and the bodies of long-dead children litter the abandoned storerooms. Every minute out of the nursery is a constant battle for survival. And the deeper into the house they go, the more they must unravel the mysteries surrounding their past and the world they've grown up in, if they ever hope to meet the parents they've always longed to see.

  Editorial review

  I absolutely love this book! I especially treasure the author’s takeaways at the end of each interview. As an introvert myself, I can identify with so many! I so appreciate how she made the connections between what has been said and how this applies to other introverts. These valuable chapters of exploration help us understand, appreciate and further develop our own unique strengths.

Quo Vadis,,Christian fiction,"Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916) won the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature. A brilliant Polish writer and patriot, he is possibly best known abroad for his monumental historical epic Quo Vadis that portrays the vibrant and dissonant combination of cruel excesses and decadence of Rome during the reign of the corrupt Emperor Nero and the high faith of the emerging era of early Christianity. Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero, is a love story of Marcus Vinicius, a passionate young Roman tribune, and Lygia Callina, a beautiful and gentle Christian maiden of royal Lygian descent and a hostage of Rome, raised in a patrician home. At first Marcus, a typical aristocratic Roman libertine of his time, has no notion of love and merely desires Lygia with erotic animalistic intensity. Through political machinations of the elegant Petronius he contrives to have her taken by force from her foster home and into the decadent and terrible splendor of the court of Ceasar, setting in motion a course of events that culminate in his own spiritual redemption. Intricately researched, populated with vibrant historical figures, and gorgeous period detail, bloody spectacle and intimate beauty, this is an epic tapestry of the triumph of love, faith and sacrifice.",,,,2006.0,,,1934169072,9781934169070,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=61b3rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.15,,,,,,,,,596.0,,,110.0,,,['Henryk Sienkiewicz']

This radiant translation by W.S. Kuniczak restores the original glory and richness of master storyteller Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic tale.Set at a turning point in history (A.D. 54-68), as Christianity replaces the era of corruption and immorality that marked Nero's Rome, Quo Vadis abounds with compelling characters, including:Vinicius, the proud centurion who has fallen deeply in love with a mysterious young woman who disappears the night they meet;Ligia, the elusive beauty. Vinicius will not easily win her love, for she is a Christian, one of the group of dedicated believers led by the apostle Peter. Christians are rare in pagan, hedonistic Rome, and suffer great persecution;Petronius, uncle to Vinicius, an elegant, witty courtier who scoffs at love and religion but finds his nephew's passion charming; andNero himself, enemy of all Christians, a despotic emperor who plunges Rome deeper and deeper into depravity. The decadence of his banquets is staggering; and even worse, his mad laughter is heard echoing in the amphitheater as gladiators duel to the death.As Nero's appalling plans for the Christians become ever clearer, time appears to be running out for the young lovers. Vinicius must come to understand the true meaning of Ligia's religion before it is too late.Grand in scope and ambition, Quo Vadis explores the themes of love, desire and profound moral courage. Lavish descriptions, vivid dialogue and brilliantly drawn characters make this one of the world's greatest epics.

Quarantine,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Religion', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Christianity']","The story of Jesus's forty days in the wilderness is surely among the most celebrated and widely diffused narratives in Western culture. Why, then, would Jim Crace choose to retell it in strictly naturalistic, non-miraculous terms? The obvious answer would be that the godless novelist is trying to debunk divinity -- to take the entire New Testament down a notch. And at first, this does seem to be the case. Crace's Jesus first got religion as an adolescent, and 'was transformed by god like other boys his age were changed by girls'. His peers view his spiritual fervour as a youthful eccentricity. Even now, as the thirty-something Jesus heads out to the Judean desert for his forty-day retreat, he's perceived by his fellow anchorites as a flighty and impractical Galilean. They even call him 'Gally' for short -- and what sort of deity answers to a nickname? Yet Crace is hardly the jeering materialist we might expect. As Jesus takes to his cliff-top cave, the author renders his religious transports without a hint of irony, and with a linguistic elegance that can hardly be called disrespectful: 'The prayers were in command of him. He shouted out across the valley, happy with the noise he made. The common words lost hold of sound. The consonants collapsed. He called on god to join him in the cave with all the noises that his lips could make. He called with all the voices in his throat.' And while most of the temptations of Christ are visited upon him by humans -- by the motley crew of his cave-dwelling neighbours -- he resists them with what we can only call superhuman will. Quarantine does, of course, operate on a fairly realistic plane.

Quartet for the End of Time,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Music', 'Literature']","Inspired by and structured around the chamber piece of the same title by the French composer Olivier Messiaen, Quartet for the End of Time is a mesmerizing story of four lives irrevocably linked in a single act of betrayal. The novel takes us on an unforgettable journey beginning during the 1930s Bonus Army riots, when World War I veteran Arthur Sinclair is falsely accused of conspiracy and then disappears. His absence will haunt his son, Douglas, as well as Alden and Sutton Kelly, the children of a powerful U.S. congressman, as they experience—each in different ways—the dynamic political social changes that took place leading up to and during World War II.From the New Deal projects through which Douglas, newly fatherless, makes his living to Sutton’s work as a journalist, to Alden’s life as a code breaker and a spy, each character is haunted by the past and is searching for love, hope, and redemption in a world torn apart by chaos and war. Through the lives of these characters, as well as those of their lovers, friends, and enemies, the novel transports us from the Siberian Expedition of World War I to the underground world of a Soviet spy in the 1920s and 1930s, to the occultist circle of P. D. Ouspensky and London during the Blitz, to the German prison camp where Messiaen originally composed and performed his famous Quartet for the End of Time.At every turn, this rich and ambitious novel tells some of the less well-known stories of twentieth-century history with epic scope and astonishing power, revealing at every turn the ways in which history and memory tend to follow us, and in which absence has a palpable presence.",,,September 4th 2014,October 6th 2014,[],Hardcover,,9780393073737,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405606365l/20663692.jpg,2.63,[],25.0,1.0,,,,52.0,168.0,480,W.

Quito 1599,City and Colony in Transition,History,"Quito has always been one of the most enigmatic of colonial Spanish American cities. The history of its enormous hinterland, only a fraction of which forms the modern Republic of Ecuador, is even less known. This engaging book takes the watershed year 1599 as a starting point for a provocative reinterpretation of the history of Quito, city and colony. The result is a lively narrative that is also an original inquiry into the driving forces behind sixteenth-century Spanish colonialism. In six overlapping topical narratives Lane brings to life a place wracked by civil disturbances, shipwrecks, indigenous uprisings, pirate attacks, maroon intransigence, urban decadence, failed missionary endeavors, sharp economic reorientations, and wily and unpredictable subaltern adaptation and resistance. Drawing from a wealth of recent research on the colonial north Andes and on more than seven years of study in the archives of Ecuador, Colombia, and Spain, Lane presents rich discoveries of interest to economic historians, including a previously unknown gold boom; however, his primary interest is people. He explores the ways both individuals and groups--shipwreck victims, slaves, laborers, merchants, traders--faced obstacles and seized (or missed) opportunities, showing readers not only the basic facts and major themes of colonial life but also the influence and outcome of individual hopes and fears among people from a multitude of races and ethnicities.",,,,2002.0,,,082632357X,9780826323576,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otABiA17lNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.59,,,,,,,,,312.0,,,21.0,,,['Kris E.

Yet Kumar shows how the golden age of physics ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the twentieth century.Quantum sets the science in the context of the great upheavals of the modern age. In 1925 the quantum pioneers nearly all hailed from upper-middle-class academic families; most were German; and their average age was 24.

As World War II begins, Hitler comes into power, and all borders and ports are closed; the Adams family is prohibited from leaving Germany-now a Nazi-controlled country. In her compelling autobiography, Marlies chronicles a little girl's unforgettable journey through starvation, bone-chilling cold, prejudice, bombings, abuse, homelessness, and fear instigated by an evil dictator.Narrated with candor and many historical details that bring her memoir to life, Marlies shares the tragic yet inspirational story of how she endured a childhood in wartime Germany by relying on her own sheer will, faith, and the unconditional love of a most unusual, yet devoted best friend.",,,03/01/12,March 15th 2012,[],Paperback,,9781450251297,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356014801l/14534775.jpg,4.31,[],100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,118.0,332,iUniverse,"['60', '39', '15', '4', '0']",,[],,"['Marlies Adams Difante', 'Ann Marie Difante']"

QED--the edited version of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to the general public at UCLA as part of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series--is perhaps the best example of his ability to communicate both the substance and the spirit of science to the layperson.The focus, as the title suggests, is quantum electrodynamics (QED), the part of the quantum theory of fields that describes the interactions of the quanta of the electromagnetic field-light, X rays, gamma rays--with matter and those of charged particles with one another. By extending the formalism developed by Dirac in 1933, which related quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of particles, Feynman revolutionized the quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of particles and waves. And, by incorporating his own readily visualizable formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman created a diagrammatic version of QED that made calculations much simpler and also provided visual insights into the mechanisms of quantum electrodynamic processes.In this book, using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned ""Feynman diagrams"" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman successfully provides a definitive introduction to QED for a lay readership without any distortion of the basic science.

Quantum Demonology,,[],"""If Faust were a 21st century metal-minded former punk with too much libido and a major attitude problem, this would be her story.""KIRKUS REVIEWIn Eggenberger’s debut novel, an aging heavy-metal music fan and aspiring writer sells her soul to the devil and finds there’s a lot more to life than good and evil.The novel’s unnamed, Scandinavian narrator has long enjoyed the freedom of being an unattached, self-described “nympho slut” and “metalhead.” However, she struggles to find time to write between shifts at her day job, and as she approaches her 47th birthday, she begins to worry that her writing career may never take off the way she’d planned and that her steady stream of young one-night stands may soon dry up. One day, as she steals a few hours to write in a Copenhagen coffee shop, a dead ringer for her favorite metal musician approaches her. She recognizes him, not as the rock icon he resembles, but as the devil himself. He offers her the promise of the writing career—and love life—she’s always dreamed of in exchange for her soul, but she’s reluctant. The devil is not accustomed to hearing “no,” and so he instead persuades her to help him destroy his wife, the biblical Lilith, before she destroys the world. As the tough-as-nails narrator’s sultry romance with the devil begins and her writing career skyrockets toward celebrity status, she finds that the real world is a lot more nuanced than the one purported by so-called moralists. The novel has distinct, well-developed feminist undertones and proves to be about much more than a powerful woman destroying another powerful woman. Fans of the long-esteemed feminist heroine Lilith may be disappointed to see her as the villain here, but she proves to be an antagonist of Maleficent-esque proportions, and readers may be torn between fearing and loving her character. Feminist readers may also be pleased to see that the tomboy narrator ultimately finds camaraderie with a well-researched group of legendary women, including the Norse goddess, Freya, and her handmaiden Fulla.An engaging, modern-day Faust for brainy rockers.Pub Date:Dec. 17th, 2013ISBN:978-0991105908Page count:610ppPublisher:Nigel's FlightProgram:Kirkus IndieReview Posted Online:Feb. 12th, 2014",,1st,,December 17th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780991105908,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385742455l/19045334.jpg,4.5,[],100.0,1.0,,,,92.0,12.0,610,Nigel's Flight,"['8', '3', '0', '1', '0']",,[],,['Sheila Eggenberger']

But a girl's got to what a girl's got to do.It's a good thing Will Killian is still around. Even though he drives me crazy, and he could seriously do with a tan - Hello! It's summer! - I'm glad he's here to help me. Now he's all distracted by this frizzy-aired girl who can - big deal - communicate with the dead, too. Whatever. I don't need Will.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Sociology', 'Leadership', 'Adult']","The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.",Quiet,First Edition (U.S.),,January 24th 2012,[],Hardcover,,9780307352149,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328562861l/8520610.jpg,4.06,"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (Shortlist) (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Nonfiction (2012)']",4143.0,51.0,,,,93.0,323829.0,333,"Crown Publishing Group/Random House, Inc.","['126571', '119856', '55832', '14027', '7543']",,[],,['Susan Cain']

Quantos Rising,,[],"The world has been split into four colonies after a Great War in which knowledge, civilizations, and time were lost from the world. After five hundred years of recreation civilization is split into four colonies: those that live on the ground call their colony ‘Damiroo‘; those who live in underwater cities call their colony ‘Retarctica‘; those who live in floating cities that hover above the clouds call their colony ‘Anotresphor‘; and those who live in space cities following the same orbit as the moon around the earth call their colony ‘Centralis‘.“Quantos Rising“, the first book in the series, follows the story of a former researcher Bruce in his attempts to save his city, El-Versium from the tyranny of the Damiroo military.Tragedy strikes in a remote city called El-Versium which becomes the war zone between the Damiroo colony’s military and their project gone wrong, Lunar-Mount—a threat detecting droid that destroys any potential source of danger with the highest threat levels relative to any around it.Now it’s up to Bruce, a former researcher from the University of APEX’s Research Facility in the city, New Middle, to shut down the droid before it destroys his home city, El-Versium with the aid of the Damiroo military who also became victims of the robot’s malfunctioning.Accompanying him are Damien, a former Scientologist from the very same University facility, and Emilia, an intern at the El-Versium medical center.The FTP source coding stream was wiped out from the robot’s programming so the trio has to dive right into the robot’s system via Neuro-Surge injection: a technology designed by both Damien and Bruce which allows for the human subconscious to be plugged right into the heart of any computer systems which generates computer functionality in a real world representation. The trio must dive into the system and program the kill switch directly into the robot’s system.Little do they know that this is yet just an cover-up operation to use the trio to further the military’s project-QR; resurfacing a long since sunken city from before the times of the war which allegedly harbored civilization’s largest King Solomon’s Library and the T-16 weapons vault.The race is on!",,Large Print,,December 9th 2015,[],ebook,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1449875486l/28175937._SX318_.jpg,4.8,[],200.0,2.0,,,,100.0,10.0,85,Ven G Books,"['8', '2', '0', '0', '0']",,[],,['Venancio Cadle Gomani Jr.']

Burroughs, es al mismo tiempo un descarnado autorretrato narrativo, una historia de amor brutalmente realista, una grotesca fantasía tragicómica y una ingeniosa novela política. Un libro que proporciona muchas claves fundamentales para adentrarse en el arrollador universo literario del autor. Esta edición definitiva, editada con motivo del 25 aniversario de su primera publicación, incorpora una extensa y documentada introducción de Oliver Harris en la que se repasan las complejas circunstancias personales en las que la obra fue escrita y que marcarían la vida y la posterior trayectoria literaria de Burroughs. Y se incluye también, a modo de epílogo, el texto que el propio autor escribió como prólogo para la edición de 1985.""Queer"" está ambientada en un inmenso suburbio, que Burroughs definiría más tarde como la «Interzona», y que abarca desde la Ciudad de México, capital mundial del delito, hasta Panamá. Un álter ego del escritor, Lee, teje su tela amorosa en torno a Allerton, un joven ambiguo, indiferente como un animal. Deambula por locales cada vez más sórdidos, en los que pulula una fauna en estado de descomposición, y en esas excursiones, como un pícaro alienado, nos regala astillas radiactivas de su negrísimo humor. Para resolver sus obsesiones mortíferas y sexuales, Lee parte con su amigo a la búsqueda de la ayahuasca, droga absoluta capaz de otorgar el control total sobre los cerebros, y por eso mismo codiciada por Rusia y Estados Unidos... y por todo adicto. Dispuesto a abismarse en todos los peligros, como un santo o un criminal con orden de búsqueda y captura, Lee no tiene nada que perder.
