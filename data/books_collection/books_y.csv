Y.B. Mangunwijaya,Rara Mendut: Sebuah Trilogi,,Indonesian,,"Rara Mendut, budak rampasan yang menolak diperistri oleh Tumenggung Wiraguna demi cintanya kepada Pranacitra. Dibesarkan di kampung nelayan pantai utara Jawa, ia tumbuh menjadi gadis yang trengginas dan tak pernah ragu menyuarakan isi pikirannya. Sosoknya dianggap nyebal tatanan di lingkungan istana di mana perempuan diharuskan bersikap serba halus dan serba patuh. Tetapi ia tak gentar. Baginya, lebih baik menyambut ajal di ujung keris Sang Tumenggung daripada dipaksa melayani nafsu panglima tua itu.Genduk Duku, sahabat Rara Mendut yang membantunya menerobos benteng Keraton Mataram dan melarikan diri dari kejaran Tumenggung Wiraguna. Setelah kematian Rara Mendut dan Pranacitra, Genduk Duku menjadi saksi perseteruan diam-diam antara Wiraguna dan Pangeran Aria Mataram, putra mahkota yang kelak bergelar Sunan Amangkurat I dan sesungguhnya juga jatuh hati kepada Rara Mendut - perempuan rampasan yang oleh ayahnya dihadiahkan kepada panglimanya yang berjasa.Lusi Lindri, anak Genduk Duku dipilih menjadi anggota pasukan pengawal Sunan Amangkurat I oleh Ibu Suri. Lusi Lindri menjalani kehidupan penuh warna di balik dinding-dinding istana yang menyimpan ribuan rahasia dan intrik-intrik jahat. Sebagai istri perwira mata-mata Mataram, ia tahu banyak... Bahkan terlalu banyak... Semakin lama nuraninya semakin terusik melihat kezaliman junjungannya. Tiada pilihan lain!

Yaa Gyasi,Homegoing,,English,,"A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, Homegoing heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control.

"Yamamoto Tsunetomo, William Scott Wilson (Translator)",Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai,,English,,"Hagakure (""In the Shadow of Leaves"") is a manual for the samurai classes consisting of a series of short anecdotes and reflections that give both insight and instruction-in the philosophy and code of behavior that foster the true spirit of Bushido-the Way of the Warrior. It is not a book of philosophy as most would understand the word: it is a collection of thoughts and sayings recorded over a period of seven years, and as such covers a wide variety of subjects, often in no particular sequence. The work represents an attitude far removed from our modern pragmatism and materialism, and possesses an intuitive rather than rational appeal in its assertion that Bushido is a Way of Dying, and that only a samurai retainer prepared and willing to die at any moment can be totally true to his lord. While Hagakure was for many years a secret text known only to the warrior vassals of the Hizen fief to which the author belonged, it later came to be recognized as a classic exposition of samurai thought and came to influence many subsequent generations, including Yukio Mishima. This translation offers 300 selections that constitute the core texts of the 1,300 present in the original.

And in the sleepy port town of Malacca, ghosts and superstitions abound.Li Lan, the daughter of a genteel but bankrupt family, has few prospects. But fate intervenes when she receives an unusual proposal from the wealthy and powerful Lim family. They want her to become a ghost bride for the family's only son, who recently died under mysterious circumstances. Rarely practiced, a traditional ghost marriage is used to placate a restless spirit. Such a union would guarantee Li Lan a home for the rest of her days, but at a terrible price.After an ominous visit to the opulent Lim mansion, Li Lan finds herself haunted not only by her ghostly would-be suitor, but also by her desire for the Lim's handsome new heir, Tian Bai. Night after night, she is drawn into the shadowy parallel world of the Chinese afterlife, with its ghost cities, paper funeral offerings, vengeful spirits and monstrous bureaucracy—including the mysterious Er Lang, a charming but unpredictable guardian spirit.

Le décor est planté pour le nouveau roman de Yasmina Khadra dont la lecture nous laisse dans une confusion de sentiments incroyable. Il y a un mélange d’humanisme, de tendresse et d’une terrible violence. Ces laissés-pour-compte, malmenés par la vie ont choisi de tourner le dos à la société, au nom de la liberté, tout en recréant malgré tout une certaine hiérarchie entre eux.On y trouve Ach le Borgne qui magnifie les clochards, Junior, son protégé, le simplet de la bande qui sera devenu un autre homme à son retour de la ville, mère de toutes les malédictions, le Pacha et sa cour, Mama et son alcoolique de mari trimbalé dans une brouette... L’ affection qui naît entre ces hommes et femmes est plus profonde qu’il n’y parait. L’auteur dépeint des conditions de vie effroyables mais dans cette âpreté et cette dureté, l’ amitié, l’ amour, la jalousie s’épanouissent autour de scènes cocasses et profondément touchantes. A travers ce quotidien de paumés il trace un voyage philosophique au coeur du mensonge, de la culpabilité et d’un violent désir de sortir de cette vie. Mais on n’ échappe pas ainsi à son destin.Yasmina Khadra vient de publier également La longue nuit d’un repenti aux Editions du moteur, un court texte qui met en scène un homme hanté chaque nuit par des cauchemars depuis son retour de la guerre.

"Yasmina Khadra, ياسمينة خضرا",Ce que le jour doit à la nuit,,French,,"Alors que Younes n’a que neuf ans, son père, paysan ruiné par un spéculateur autochtone, perd ses terres ancestrales. Accablé, l’homme doit se résoudre à confier son enfant à son frère, un pharmacien parfaitement intégré à la communauté pied-noir d’une petite ville de l’Oranais. Le sacrifice est immense. En abandonnant son fils, l’homme perd du même coup le respect de lui-même.Mais les yeux bleus de Younes et son physique d’ange l’aident à se faire accepter par cette communauté aisée de province. Rebaptisé Jonas, il grandit parmi de jeunes colons dont il devient l’inséparable camarade. Il découvre avec eux les joies de l’existence et partage leurs rêves d’adolescents privilégiés que ni la Seconde Guerre Mondiale ni les convulsions d’un nationalisme arabe en pleine expansion ne perturbent. Jusqu’au jour où revient au village Émilie, une jeune fille splendide qui va devenir la vestale de nos jeunes gens. Naîtra ainsi une grande histoire d’amour qui mettra à rude épreuve la complicité fraternelle des quatre garçons, écartelés entre la loyauté, l’égoïsme et la rancune que la guerre d’Indépendance va aggraver. La révolte algérienne sera, pour Younes-Jonas, sanglante et fratricide. Il refusera de laisser détruire l’amitié exceptionnelle qui l’unit à ces jeunes pieds-noirs ; il ne pourra tourner le dos à cet oncle et à cette tante qui lui ont offert une vie meilleure ; mais jamais il n’acceptera non plus de renoncer aux valeurs inculquées par son père : la fierté, la déférence envers ses ancêtres et les coutumes de son peuple, le respect absolu de la parole donnée, et, ce, quitte à mettre en péril l’amour déchirant qu’il a pour Émilie.Avec la verve romanesque qu’on lui connaît, Yasmina Khadra éclaire d’un nouveau jour ce conflit ayant opposé deux peuples amoureux d’un même pays. La grande originalité de cette saga qui se déroule de 1930 à nos jours repose sur une courageuse défense de cette double culture franco-algérienne que l’Histoire a, de part et d’autre, trop souvent cherché à renier.",,,,August 21st 2008,"['Germaine', 'Younes Mahieddine', 'Jean-Christophe Lamy', 'Emilie Cazenave', 'Mahi', 'Fabrice Scamaroni', 'Simon Benyamin', 'André Jiménez Sosa']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Algeria', 'France', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'War', 'Contemporary']",,9782260017585,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1256832543l/4459330.jpg,4.19,[],91.0,1.0,,4459330-ce-que-le-jour-doit-la-nuit,,,,,95.0,4045.0,441,,Julliard,"['1774', '1485', '599', '148', '39']",,,['Oran (Algeria)'],,

Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion, The Attack portrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.",,,08/18/05,May 9th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'France', 'Graphic Novels', 'Israel', 'Algeria', 'Comics', 'Contemporary', 'Drama']",,9780385517485,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172758981l/213206._SX318_.jpg,3.81,"['Prix des Libraires (2006)', 'Prix Tropiques (2006)', 'Literaturpreis der Jury der jungen Leser for Kritikerpreis (2007)', ""Prix Gabrielle-d'Estrées (2006)""]",189.0,2.0,,213206.The_Attack,,,,,91.0,8058.0,257,,Nan A.

"Yasmina Reza, Laura Frausin Guarino (Translator), Ena Marchi (Translator)",Il dio del massacro,,Italian,,"Fin dalle primissime battute di questa commedia al tempo stesso esilarante e feroce appare chiaro perché Roman Polanski abbia deciso di portarla sullo schermo – e perché attori come Isabelle Huppert, Ralph Fiennes e James Gandolfini abbiano voluto interpretarla a teatro. Poche volte, infatti, un autore è stato capace di squarciare con altrettanto soave crudeltà i veli destinati a ricoprire la costitutiva barbarie della creatura umana. Nel lindo, assennato salotto borghese in cui due coppie di genitori si incontrano per cercare di risolvere, da persone adulte e civili quali essi ritengono di essere, una questione in fondo di poco conto (una lite scoppiata ai giardinetti tra i rispettivi figli), vediamo sgretolarsi a poco a poco le maschere di benevolenza, tolleranza, buona creanza, e di correttezza politica, apertura mentale, dirittura morale; e sotto quelle maschere apparire il ghigno del nume efferato e oscuro che ci governa sin dalla notte dei tempi: il dio del massacro, appunto. Con uno humour corrosivo e una sorta di noncurante cinismo (e senza mai assumere il tono del moralista), in una lingua volutamente media, che sfodera tutto il suo micidiale potere, Yasmina Reza costruisce un brillante psicodramma, porgendo allo spettatore (e al lettore) uno specchio deformante nel quale scoprirà, non senza un acido imbarazzo, qualcosa che lo riguarda molto da vicino.",,Piccola Biblioteca Adelphi #617,January 19th 2007,2011,[],Paperback,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Theatre', 'France', 'Fiction', 'French Literature', '21st Century', 'Contemporary', 'School', 'Literature']",,9788845926235,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327260871l/12742708.jpg,3.82,[],47.0,1.0,,12742708-il-dio-del-massacro,,,,,91.0,4351.0,91,,Adelphi,"['1162', '1705', '1095', '304', '85']",,,[],,

Bagai seorang ahli origami, lipatlah kertas tersebut menjadi dua, empat, delapan, enam belas, dan seterusnya, sampai pada satu titik kertas itu tidak bisa dilipat lagi, bagaimanapun dilakukan. Kertas itu tidak dapat dilipat lagi disebabkan ada batas kemampuan struktur kertas tersebut yang menahan perubahan dirinya.Pemaksaan —berupa penekanan, pemadatan, pemampatan, atau perusakan akan memungkinkan kertas dilipat lebih lanjut. Akan tetapi, ini berarti kita melampaui batas-batas struktur, sifat, dan karakteristik yang seharusnya tidak dilewati. Melipat melewati batas yang seharusnya tidak dilewati —melalui cara pemaksaan, pemadatan, pemampatan, penekanan, perusakan, dan pengerdilan (miniaturisasi)—itulah lukisan sesungguhnya dari apa yang disebut sebagai dunia yang dilipat yang ingin dilukiskan dalam buku ini.Melipat Waktu, Melipat Ruang, Melipat Tanda, Melipat Budaya; itulah empat bahasa besar yang termuat dalam buku ini.

Yasraf Amir Piliang,Hipersemiotika: Tafsir Cultural Studies Atas Matinya Makna,,Indonesian,,"Buku tentang semiotika ini dimulai dari sebuah definisi semiotika yang dikemukakan oleh Umberto Eco yang mengatakan, bahwa semiotika ""... pada prinsipnya adalah sebuah disiplin yang mempelajari segala sesuatu yang dapat digunakan untuk berdusta (lie)."" Definis Eco ini ꟷmeskipun mungkin sangat mencengangkan banyak orangꟷsecara eksplisit menjelaskan betapa sentralnya konsep dusta di dalam wacana semiotika, sehingga dusta tampaknya menjadi prinsip utama semiotika itu sendiri. Kenapa? Karena, semiotika sebagai satu bentuk representasi pada dasarnya adalah sesuatu yang hadir namun menunjukkan bahwa sesuatu di luar dirinya sendirilah yang coba dia hadirkan. Representasi tidak menunjuk kepada dirinya sendiri, namun kepada orang lain. Karena sifat dasar itulah, maka representasi sering dipermasalahkan ihwal kemampuannya untuk bisa menghadikan ""sesuatu"" di luar dirinya, karena seringkali representasi malah beralih menjadi ""sesuatu"" itu sendiri. Jurang yang terbentuk antara representasi dan yang direpresentasikan ini seringkali terlupakan oleh manusia. Nah, permasalahan ""tipuan"" seperti inilah yang menjadi landasan pembahasan tentang [hiper]semiotika dalam buku. Inilah buku yang menjadi rujukan wajib bagi para pemerhati semiotika dan cultural studies.Buku ini sebagai buku utuh, berhasil memperlhatkan secara menyeluruh dan rinci ... [disertai]...

This new collection includes twenty-two stories now appearing in English for the first time in book form. Written between 1923 and 1929, these short fictions form a shadow biography of the author's early years, and provide fresh glimpses of Kawabata's haunting and haunted vision. Born in 1899, Kawabata committed suicide at age seventy-two. Throughout his life he was concerned with themes of loss, longing, and memory. His childhood was repeatedly shaken by deaths in the family - first his parents when he was three, then a grandmother, an older sister, and finally the blind grandfather he cared for in his early adolescence. These personal losses linger as motifs in such remarkable stories as ""Gathering Ashes"" and ""The Master of Funerals."" The stark physical details of caregiving - suffused with edgy resentment and desperate fear - are remembered in ""Diary of My Sixteenth Year."" In addition to the twenty-two stories unknown to American readers, this collection features the first translation of the complete text of the classic ""Dancing Girl of Izu."" This unforgettable story portrays the tender anxiety of a young man whose brooding fascination with a pubescent girl nudges him along the path toward adulthood.",,,,1998.0,,,,1887178945,9781887178945,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TvE_tAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.78,,,,,,,,,,,,176.0,,,,1322.0,,,,

Yefim Gordon;Peter Davison,Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker,,,History,"Recognized as one of the best fighters of the 1990s, the Su-27 Flanker is a single-seat supersonic interceptor that is often declared the finest and most successful fighter of the Cold War era. Designed by Sukhoi OKB, the imposing fighter quickly gained popularity and respect from countries all across the globe. Intended to be a direct competitor to the new generation of American fighters such as the F-15, the Su-27 was designed with outstanding range, heavy armament, and high agility. Excellent performance, handling, and serviceability have made the aircraft popular with its pilots and ground personnel alike. Equipped with an analog fly-by-wire control system, a full avionics suite, and up to 10 air-to-air missiles, the Flanker also features a rearward-facing radar between the engines, allowing it to fire at targets behind the aircraft. Outfitted with two Lyul'ka AL-31F turbofans, each 12,500 kgp (27,557 lb st) with afterburning, the Su-27's high thrust-to-weight ratio and refined aerodynamics allow superb flight characteristics at high angles of attack. Yefim Gordon and Peter Davison are the authors of several books on Soviet aircraft including the Specialty Press titles Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum and Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-15 Fagot. Over 300 photos illustrate the story of the Su-27. Topics covered include design, development, structural detail, international production, trials, upgrades and generations, comparisons, overseas sales, and much more.

Yeshayahu Ben-Aharon,"The Event in Science, History, Philosophy & Art",,English,,"In this book, Dr. Ben-Aharon demonstrates how the transformation of human consciousness in modern times is expressed in the fields of Science, History, Philosophy, and Art. He shows how creative concepts have been discovered and applied in physics, biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence. In the Philosophy chapter, Ben-Aharon traces the thought of Deleuze and Guattari, Foucault, Derrida, Badiou and Levinas and shows that this radical thinking is no longer abstract, theoretical reasoning or mere speculation. Rather, it is an exercise in generating real cognitive and moral substance, taking the human beyond the traditional boundaries of body, subjectivity, and identity. The chapter on Art demonstrates how contemporary artistic work joins together with science and thinking to create a new stream of real becoming and evolution.

Στη σύνθεση αυτή ο ποιητής, συνδέοντας με τρόπο προσωπικό διάφορα στοιχεία της ιστορικής παράδοσης και ποικίλους εκφραστικούς τρόπους, μας δίνει ανάγλυφη τη μορφή της Ελλάδας και των ανθρώπων της στον αδιάκοπο αγώνα τους για ελευθερία, δικαιοσύνη και ανθρωπιά.Το ποίημα αποτελείται από επτά ενότητες:Η ενότητα Ι αναδεικνύει την αντιστοιχία, τη συνάρτηση του ήθους τοπίου και ανθρώπων και την εμμονή της αντίστασής τους. Ο χώρος και οι άνθρωποι πολιορκούνται από στεριά και θάλασσα, αλλά η πολιορκία αυτή αναιρείται από ένα θαύμα που εξακοντίζεται στον ορίζοντα.Η ενότητα ΙΙ αποδίδει εικόνες της Ρωμιοσύνης στην καθημερινότητά τους αλλά και στη διαχρονική τους σύνθεση. Εδώ το τοπίο καταυγάζεται από την αρχετυπική παρουσία της γυναίκας, την Παναγία ""με τ’ αργυρά ματόκλαδα"", που συνυπάρχει πολύ ανθρώπινα με την κόρη του πεταλωτή αλλά και την ορφική μητέρα, τη Λήδα, ""που κλωσά τ’ αυγά του κεραυνού"", τη Νιόβη, με τα ""επτά σφαγμένα παλικάρια"" της, τη Σολωμική ελευθερία, ""που θα πάρει πάλι τ’ άρματα"" και την Περσεφόνη που μοιράζει σπορά και γονιμότητα. Όλες αυτές οι γυναικείες μορφές συγκλίνουν στη μορφή της μητέρας Ελλάδας.Η ενότητα ΙΙΙ τονίζει ιδιαίτερα τη διαχρονικότητα της ρωμαίικης ζωής και τη διαρκή αγωνιστική ετοιμότητά της. Εδώ η ιστορία υφαίνεται μ’ ένα όνομα από τρεις χιλιάδες χρόνια μ’ έναν άγιο, με μια κόκκινη γοργόνα, αλλά και με την μυθική παρουσία του Προμηθέα σ’ ένα ανακυκλούμενο αιώνιο γίγνεσθαι.Η ενότητα ΙV περιγράφει την αγωνιστική πορεία, ""δέντρο το δέντρο, πέτρα την πέτρα, πέρασαν τον κόσμο"", και την άδοξη κατάληξή της, ""και τούτοι μεσ’ τα σίδερα και κείνοι μεσ’ το χώμα"", αλλά και την πεποίθηση για την τελική απολύτρωση.Η ενότητα V σκιαγραφεί το αίσθημα της καταστροφής και της ερήμωσης του μαρτυρικού τόπου αλλά και την προσδοκία της παλιννόστησης της ζωής. Τότε, ""θα διαβάσουμε όλη την καρδιά τους"" (των μαρτύρων της ελευθερίας)""σαν να διαβάζουμε από την αρχή την ιστορία του κόσμου"".Η ενότητα VI αποδίδει παραστατικότερα την εφιαλτική πραγματικότητα του εμφύλιου σπαραγμού και του θανάτου αλλά και την επιμονή στη συνέχιση της ζωής και του αγώνα. Μόνο ""για τα ψηλά είναι ακόμα δρόμος"".Τέλος η VII ενότητα προβάλλει και πάλι την ταυτότητα του τόπου και των ανθρώπων, που μέσα από τη γνώση του θανάτου προχωρούν με περισσότερη σιγουριά προς τη ζωή και την αγάπη, πέρα από τους διαχωρισμούς του πολέμου.",,,11/06/54,1991,[],Paperback,['Poetry'],,9789600404579,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1287579627l/9541777.jpg,4.54,[],70.0,1.0,,9541777,,,,,99.0,211.0,28,,Κέδρος,"['136', '57', '15', '1', '2']",,,[],,

Yu Hua, award-winning author of To Live, gives us a surreal tale of two brothers riding the dizzying roller coaster of life in a newly capitalist world.

Their tribulations play out across a richly populated backdrop that is every bit as vibrant: the rapidly-changing village of Liu Town, full of such lively characters as the self-important Poet Zhao, the craven dentist Yanker Yu, the virginal town beauty (turned madam) Lin Hong, and the simpering vendor Popsicle Wang.With sly and biting humor, combined with an insightful and compassionate eye for the lives of ordinary people, Yu Hua shows how the madness of the Cultural Revolution has transformed into the equally rabid madness of extreme materialism.

While an acolyte at the temple, he fixates on the structure’s aesthetic perfection and it becomes the one and only object of his desire.

It later became known all over Japan, and during the Second World War Jōchō’s precept ‘I found that the Way of the Samurai is death’, became a slogan to spur on Kamikaze pilots. But the Hagakure is not only about death. In this, his adaptation and interpretation of it, Yukio Mishima deals with its teachings on action, subjectivity, strength of character, passion and love, and delights in giving prolific examples of Jōchō’s practical advice from proper behavior at a drinking party to child rearing. In the Hagakure, the most important influence on his life – and his death – Mishima saw striking similarities between his criticisms of materialistic post-war Japan and Jōchō’s criticisms of the sumptuous decadence of his contemporaries; and it is this emphasis which gives it its immediacy.",,,10/30/67,August 4th 1977,['Yamamoto Tsunetomo'],Hardcover,"['Japan', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japanese Literature', 'Martial Arts', 'Literature', 'History', 'Asian Literature', 'LGBT', 'Religion']",,9780465090891,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311234224l/162374.jpg,3.89,[],96.0,1.0,,162374.Way_Of_The_Samurai,,,,,93.0,592.0,166,,Basic Books,"['179', '217', '155', '36', '5']",,,[],,

The Crimson Labyrinth is a wicked satire on extremist reality TV in the tradition of The Running Man-if that indeed is what it is. Welcome to THE MARS LABYRINTH where things aren't what they seem. Welcome to the world of Kishi, where the plot is as gnarly as the humor is twisted.When an unemployed former math major wakes up one day, he wonders if he's somehow ended up on the red planet. The good-looking young woman with aid-she says her name is Ai and that she draws erotic comics for a living-seems to have no clue either as to their whereabouts. Their only leads are cryptic instructions beamed to a portable device. Has the game begun?There is no reset button, no saving and no continue-make the wrong move and it's really GAME OVER.

Yuval Noah Harari,21 Lessons for the 21st Century,,English,,"In Sapiens, he explored our past. In Homo Deus, he looked to our future. Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers.

Yuval Noah Harari,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,,English,,"100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?

Yuval Noah Harari,Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow,,English,,"Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.

Yvan Byeajee (Goodreads Author),Paradigm Shift: How proper organization and preparation are the back-bones of any trading success (Trading Easyread Series Book 1),,English,,"We all want consistent trading results, but how many of us have actually prepared for this? Trading is a highly competitive field and a very challenging endeavor where the learning curve is known to be very steep. The very nature of financial markets makes them uncertain and almost impossible to predict on a trade by trade basis. Hence, people who like to use their intellect to predict the markets are the ones who typically don't make it as consistently profitable traders. People who need to have that kind of certainty - not acting until they know what will happen next - are the ones who experience the most frustration because they are expecting something that the markets just cannot provide. And, in today's markets we are required more than ever to adapt and evolve in a manner that is quick and concise, if we want to acquire even the slightest edge. The Trading Easyread series targets the new generation of online traders who have an unquenchable desire to profit from the markets and who are willing to do the work necessary to achieve that goal. This book was written by a professional trader for beginning and intermediate level traders. Professionals will also find value in it as it can help them refresh their already acquired skills. The irony of all this is that, when your paradigm shifts - when you acquire a ‘trader’s mindset’ and, can remain confident in the face of constant uncertainty - trading will be as easy and as simple as you probably thought it was when you first started out. It is my hope is that the material presented in this book will bring you one step closer to that ideal mindset.",,,,July 12th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B00LRYXMTO,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427495420l/25232065.jpg,4.3,[],100.0,1.0,,25232065-paradigm-shift,,,,,94.0,33.0,88,,,"['19', '8', '4', '1', '1']",,,[],,

Yves Marechal,"The Hydrogen Bond and the Water Molecule: The Physics and Chemistry of Water, Aqueous and Bio Media",,English,,"The Hydrogen Bond and the Water Molecule offers a synthesis of what is known and currently being researched on the topic of hydrogen bonds and water molecules. The most simple water molecular, H2O, is a fascinating but poorly understood molecule. Its unique ability to attract an exceptionally large number of hydrogen bonds induces the formation of a dense hydrogen bond network that has the potential to modify the properties of the surrounding molecules and their reactivities. The crucial role that water molecules play is described in this book. The author begins by providing an overview of the thermodynamical and structural properties of H-bonds before examining their much less known dynamical properties, which makes them appear as centres of reactivity. Methods used to observe these components are also reviewed. In the second part of the book the role played by the dense H-bond network developed by H2O molecules is examined. First in ice, where it has important atmospheric consequences, then in liquid water, and finally in macromolecules where it sheds some original light on the fundamental question How is it that without water and hydrogen bonds life would not exist?. This book will be of interest to researchers in the fields of physics, chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology. It can also serve as a teaching aid for students attending course in chemical physics, chemistry or molecular biology.

Giselle's life in France was uncomplicated until her American father, whom she always wanted to meet but never did, died. Now Giselle is coming to the United States to meet her flamboyant grandmother. Growing up in France, America was what Giselle and her friends saw in the movies. Experiencing it first hand, however, is a whole new reality. Still, Giselle wants to give her new life in America a chance, but as soon as she thinks her life cannot get any more complicated, she finds herself hooked on Hunter, a 25-year-old former Navy SEAL.

He quickly pulled both of my arms behind my back and kept me immobilized with his one hand. I was still angry and I jerked my head from side to side.

The woman tells the new arrival that she is buying her son a treat for his birthday. Every year she buys him his favourite cake; even though he died in an accident when he was six years old. From this beginning Yoko Ogawa weaves a dark and beautiful narrative that pulls together a seemingly disconnected cast of characters. In the tradition of classical Japanese poetic collections, the stories in Revenge are linked through recurring images and motifs, as each story follows on from the one before while simultaneously introducing new characters and themes.
