""If you’re going to do something, make sure you do it with excellence,"" Gran would say. That was when Gran was feeling talkative, and not brooding for days in her room — like she did after telling Annie and her little brother, Rew, the one thing they know about their father: that he was killed in a fight with an angry man who was sent away. Annie tells stories, too, as she and Rew laze under the birches and oaks of Zebra Forest — stories about their father the pirate, or pilot, or secret agent. But then something shocking happens to unravel all their stories: a rattling at the back door, an escapee from the prison holding them hostage in their own home, four lives that will never be the same. Driven by suspense and psychological intrigue, Zebra Forest deftly portrays an unfolding standoff of truth against family secrets — and offers an affecting look at two resourceful, imaginative kids as they react and adapt to the hand they’ve been dealt.",,,04/01/13,April 9th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780763660413,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351213430l/15798672.jpg,3.75,"[""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award Nominee (2015)"", 'The Magnolia Award Nominee for 6-8 (2016)']",95.0,1.0,,,,90.0,3387.0,208,Candlewick Press,"['850', '1289', '893', '258', '97']",,[],,['Adina Rishe Gewirtz']

When his military days were over, Simmons, a former Air Force sergeant, began a torturous series of acts of violence and humiliation against his family. While a fierce presence to his wife, Becky, and six of their seven children, he became exceptionally tender with his favorite daughter, Sheila, and forced her into an incestuous relationship that culminated in the birth of a child. Simmons went through a series of menial jobs and, after several moves, finally settled his family in the foothills of the Ozarks. But faced with growing frustration of his need for control, along with his daughter's rejection of him and marriage to another man, which he claimed had ruined his plans to have a happy life alone with her, he prepared the ritual killing of all those who had made his dream unworkable.

Zofloya,,"['Gothic', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Horror', '19th Century', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Italy', 'British Literature', 'Fantasy']","'Few venture as thou hast in the alarming paths of sin.' This is the final judgement of Satan on Victoria di Loredani, the heroine of Zofloya, or The Moor (1806), a tale of lust, betrayal, and multiple murder set in Venice in the last days of the fifteenth century. The novel follows Victoria's progress from spoilt daughter of indulgent aristocrats, through a period of abuse and captivity, to a career of deepening criminality conducted under Satan's watchful eye. Charlotte Dacre's narrative deftly displays her heroine's movement from the vitalized position of Ann Radcliffe's heroines to a fully conscious commitment to vice that goes beyond that of 'Monk' Lewis's deluded Ambrosio.

Following his introduction, the novel is divided into seven parts, whose titles indicate the sevenfold path of spiritual development. The fourth section, ""The Dweller of the Threshold,"" is the book's centerpiece, revealing significant esoteric facts and experiences.A novelist, a dramatist, a scholar, an editor, and an active member of Parliament, Sir Edward was an extremely successful author whose writings were widely read throughout England and Europe. He poured into this esoteric work all of the ancient esoteric wisdom that he felt he could reveal to the public during an age buried deeply in materialism.This work remains one of the great, pioneering landmarks of esoteric writing.C O N T E N T SPrefaceIntroductionThe MusicianArt, Love, and WonderTheurgiaThe Dweller of the ThresholdThe Effects of the ElixirSuperstition Deserting FaithThe Reign of TerrorNoteZanoni ExplainedArgument",,,10/30/42,December 1st 1990,[],Paperback,,9780833400178,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347261177l/420474.jpg,3.69,[],96.0,1.0,,,,80.0,478.0,462,Steiner Books,"['169', '137', '76', '45', '51']",,[],,['Edward Bulwer-Lytton']

Zvi,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'History', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'Biography Memoir']","Zvi is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss.

(Jonathan Galassi's translation of Leopardi's Canti was published by FSG in 2010.)Giacomo Leopardi was the greatest Italian poet of the nineteenth century and was recognized by readers from Nietzsche to Beckett as one of the towering literary figures in Italian history. To many, he is the finest Italian poet.He was a prodigious scholar of classical literature and philosophy, and a voracious reader in numerous ancient and modern languages. For most of his writing career, he kept an immense notebook, known as the Zibaldone, or ""hodge-podge,"" as Harold Bloom has called it, in which Leopardi put down his original, wide-ranging, radically modern responses to his reading. His comments about religion, philosophy, language, history, anthropology, astronomy, literature, poetry, and love are unprecedented in their brilliance and suggestiveness, and the Zibaldone, which was only published at the turn of the twentieth century, has been recognized as one of the foundational books of modern culture. Its 4,500-plus pages have never been fully translated into English until now, when a team under the auspices of Michael Caesar and Franco D'Intino of the Leopardi Centre in Birmingham, England, have spent years producing a lively, accurate version.

He soon joins La Justicia, a secret underground resistance movement devoted to helping the powerless and the poor. Between the New World and the Old, the persona of Zorro is formed, a great hero is born, and the legend begins. After many adventures -- duels at dawn, fierce battles with pirates at sea, and impossible rescues -- Diego de la Vega, a.k.a.

The mind in question belongs to one Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are Zeno’s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpected–and unexpectedly happy–marriage to Ada’s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and irony, and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, Zeno’s Conscience is a miracle of psychological realism.",,,10/28/23,February 4th 2003,['Zeno Cosini'],Paperback,,9780375727764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348736270l/84737.jpg,3.82,[],1195.0,16.0,,,,90.0,16019.0,437,Vintage,"['4757', '5756', '3873', '1181', '452']",,['Trieste (Italy)'],,"['Italo Svevo', 'William Weaver']"

In the view of James Austin, the trend implies a ""perennial psychophysiology"" -- because awakening, or enlightenment, occurs only when the human brain undergoes substantial changes. What are the peak experiences of enlightenment? How could these states profoundly enhance, and yet simplify, the workings of the brain? Zen and the Brain presents the latest evidence. In this book Zen Buddhism becomes the opening wedge for an extraordinarily wide-ranging exploration of consciousness. In order to understand which brain mechanisms produce Zen states, one needs some understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the brain. Austin, both a neurologist and a Zen practitioner, interweaves the most recent brain research with the personal narrative of his Zen experiences. The science is both inclusive and rigorous; the Zen sections are clear and evocative. Along the way, Austin examines such topics as similar states in other disciplines and religions, sleep and dreams, mental illness, consciousness-altering drugs, and the social consequences of the advanced stage of ongoing enlightenment.",,,02/28/98,June 4th 1999,[],Paperback,,9780262511094,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347474515l/238846.jpg,4.1,[],100.0,1.0,,,,94.0,445.0,872,MIT Press,"['186', '150', '81', '23', '5']",,[],,['James H.

And to the cats. But, mostly, to the dogs...These are some of the wonderful tales told by the world-famous “monkey with a typewriter”, the macaque Jaxy Mono, in Zootopia - his follow-up to his smash hit of “monkey lit”, The Book Of Dubious Beasts.Beautifully illustrated with drawings by renowned artist Dmitry Pousirev, Zootopia is suitable for children and adults from 11 to 111. It contains such classic once-read-never-forgotten stories as Mother Nature, The Arctic Penguin, The Crow, and The Eletiger.*ABOUT ZOOTOPIA:“The book of life is written with an alphabet of only four letters – A, T, G and C. Yet these four letters, repeated in endless variations, are enough to spell out the recipes for life forms as diverse as bacteria, fungae, plants, insects, fish, birds, mammals, and even a singularly pompous, pretentious, and self-important species of old world monkey called Homo sapiens.So, just imagine what weird and wonderful creatures could be invented using all twenty-six letters of the alphabet; from doggypotamuses and rat-toothed catypusses, to winged cargo mammoths and elephanzees. The possibilities are mind-boggling!Of course, the cynics amongst you will object that it is almost infinitely unlikely that a macaque tapping away at the screen of an iPad could hit upon a sequence of letters that resulted in even a fictitious life-form. That would require a God-like author with conscious intent.But isn’t Mother Nature herself really no more than a monkey with a typewriter; blindly tapping out A, T, G and C over and over, until she hits upon the code of a valid life-form?And, surely, what’s good enough for Mother Nature should be good enough for us, her children…”",,First Edition - paperback,,April 2016,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461516965l/29989809._SX318_.jpg,4.08,[],99.0,1.0,,,,92.0,24.0,252,,"['13', '4', '5', '0', '2']",,[],,['Jaxy Mono']

"Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris",,"['History', 'Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Africa', 'Nature', 'Travel', 'Natural History', 'Egypt', 'Science']","In October 1826, a ship arrived at Marseille carrying the first giraffe ever seen in France. A royal offering from Muhammad Ali, Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt, to King Charles X, she had already traveled 2,000 miles down the Nile to Alexandria, from where she had sailed across the Mediterranean standing in the hold, her long neck and head protruding through a hole cut in the deck. In the spring of 1827, after wintering in Marseille, she was carefully walked 550 miles to Paris to the delight of thousands of onlookers.The viceroy's tribute was politically motivated: He commanded the Turkish forces then fighting the Greeks in their war of independence, and hoped his gift would persuade the French not to intervene against him. But the viceroy and his intentions were quickly forgotten as France fell in love with its ""beautiful stranger.""Zarafa chronicles the full story of this remarkable animal, revealing a kaleidoscope of history, science, and culture that opens an exotic window on the early nineteenth century. From the Enlightenment's blossoming fascination with science to Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Egypt in 1798–from the eminent French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire to Bernardino Drovetti, French consul general in Egypt and tomb robber extraordinaire–the era was full of memorable events and characters. Michael Allin deftly weaves them into the story with an appreciation for detail and an uncommon affection.The giraffe's strange and wonderful journey linked Africa and Europe in mutual discovery. Although her arrival did not keep the French out of Ali's war, she became an instant celebrity in Paris and over the next eighteen years she fascinated all of Europe. Through Michael Allin's narrative skill, Zarafa stirs the imagination as it provides a new context for the history of a distant age.",,,05/31/98,August 10th 1999,[],Paperback,,9780385334112,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403167382l/270482.jpg,3.57,[],87.0,1.0,,,,87.0,518.0,228,Delta,"['100', '171', '181', '58', '8']",,[],,['Michael Allin']

He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he’s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love.

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.

Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Biography', 'Christianity', 'Audiobook', 'Spirituality', 'Historical', 'Theology', 'Christian']","From the internationally bestselling author of No god but God comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth. Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the “Kingdom of God.” The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious “King of the Jews” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth’s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.",,,,July 16th 2013,['Jesus'],Kindle Edition,,9781400069224,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374252172l/18206751.jpg,3.84,"['Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2013)']",81.0,1.0,,,,89.0,61141.0,336,Random House,"['19218', '22585', '12439', '3875', '3024']",,[],,['Reza Aslan']

Zombie Zone Zero,,['Zombies'],"In this hauntingly savage tale of survival, a group of strangers trapped in a liquor store in Prince George, British Columbia, struggle to stay alive in the first few weeks of the zombie apocalypse during the depths of a bitter Canadian winter in late 2012. Led by store manager, Chris Daniels, and the mysterious, but brutally effective, Arthur Johnson, the ragtag group eventually escapes the city and goes on the run from town to town across a province that has gone from one of the most beautiful places in the world to a frigid landscape of gruesome terror, where the dead desire only to rend the flesh of the living. However, the hordes of ravenous flesh-eating corpses soon become overshadowed by an even greater danger. Other survivors roam the lonely wastelands of the frozen north and one group is ruthlessly hunting all of the others, cruelly slaughtering every living soul in celebration of the end of the world. At times darkly amusing, Zombie Zone Zero is both an erotic love story and a gruesome horror tale, but mostly it is a story of redemption.

Zizek,A Critical Introduction,Social Science,"Zizek is hailed as the most significant interdisciplinary thinker of modern times. His work is a powerful, often explosive combination of Lacanian psychoanalysis and philosophy which tests key psychoanalytical concepts against the ideas of major European thinkers, especially Hegel. It has ignited enthusiasm and stimulated new approaches across a vast range of disciplines, and seems to be attracting an ever-growing readership. In part, this is because Zizek himself has a panoramic range of interests encompassing film studies, literature, cyber culture, ethics, theology and, above all, politics. It is also because he is a highly entertaining writer, having a flair for anecdote, a smutty sense of humour and the knack of capturing complex ideas in concrete form. Sarah Kay's book provides a lucid and comprehensive introduction to Zizek's work. His writings to date are presented and evaluated here for the first time, together with an outline of their development and explanations of his key premises, themes and terms. This book will be essential reading for students of cultural studies, literary studies, philosophy and social and political theory.",,,,2003.0,,,0745622089,9780745622088,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJfIC6_Ws3QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.38,,,,,,,,,195.0,,,36.0,,,['Sarah Kay']

Many of us crave more contact with wild creatures, and recognize the small and large ways animals enrich our lives, yet don’t notice the animals already around us.Zooburbia reveals the reverence that can be felt in the presence of animals and shows how that reverence connects us to a deeper, better part of ourselves. A lively blend of memoir, natural history, and mindfulness practices, Zooburbia makes the case for being mindful and compassionate stewards — and students — of the wildlife with whom we coexist. With lessons on industriousness, perseverance, presence, exuberance, gratitude, aging, how to let go, and much more, Tai's vignettes share the happy fact that none of us is alone — our teachers are right in front of us.

Zane's Redemption,,"['Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Romance', 'Erotica', 'Fantasy', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Contemporary', 'Erotic Romance', 'Supernatural']","The last thing vampire bodyguard Zane wants to do is to guard a hybrid, a half-vampire, half-human, whose father wants to keep her a virgin. Known for his violent temper and callous lack of compassion, Zane’s out-of-control rage, born of the cruelty he suffered during the Holocaust, drives him to focus only on revenge. Trying to find the last of his torturers is his only goal in life.Portia is a young hybrid with a serious dilemma: in a few weeks, her body will be set in its final vampire form. If she is to avoid having to live out her immortal life as a virgin, she must find a lover in that short time—something her father hires Zane to prevent.The moment Portia and Zane meet, rules begin to bend, and a forbidden attraction bursts into flames hotter than the hell of Zane’s past. But that past threatens to pull them apart unless they can overcome their prejudice, forsake hate for love, and revenge for forgiveness.Scanguards Vampires Series:Book 1: Samson's Lovely MortalBook 2: Amaury's HellionBook 3: Gabriel's MateBook 4: Yvette's HavenBook 5: Zane's Redemption",Scanguards Vampires #5,,,November 2nd 2011,[],ebook,,9781937519179,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320537947l/12406076.jpg,4.33,[],51.0,1.0,,,,97.0,7107.0,338,Tina Folsom,"['3717', '2286', '903', '135', '66']",,[],,['Tina Folsom']

Zazen,,"['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Queer', 'Unfinished', 'Literary Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Contemporary']","Somewhere in Della’s consumptive, industrial wasteland of a city, a bomb goes off. It is not the first, and will not be the last.Reactions to the attacks are polarized. Police activity intensifies. Della’s revolutionary parents welcome the upheaval but are trapped within their own insular beliefs. Her activist restaurant co-workers, who would rather change their identities than the world around them, resume a shallow rebellion of hair-dye, sex parties, and self-absorption. As those bombs keep inching closer, thudding deep and real between the sounds of katydids fluttering in the still of the city night, and the destruction begins to excite her. What begins as terror threats called in to greasy bro-bars across the block boils over into a desperate plot, intoxicating and captivating Della and leaving her little chance for escape.Zazen unfolds as a search for clarity soured by irresolution and catastrophe, yet made vital by the thin, wild veins of imagination run through each escalating moment, tensing and relaxing, unfurling and ensnaring.

Zhou Enlai: The Last Perfect Revolutionary,,"['History', 'China', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Asia', 'World History']","Zhou Enlai, the premier of the People's Republic of China from 1949 until his death in 1976, is the last Communist political leader to be revered by the Chinese people. He is considered ""a modern saint"" who offered protection to his people during the Cultural Revolution; an admirable figure in an otherwise traumatic and bloody era. Works about Zhou in China are heavily censored, and every hint of criticism is removed—so when Gao Wenqian first published this groundbreaking, provocative biography in Hong Kong, it was immediately banned in the People's Republic. Using classified documents spirited out of China, Gao Wenqian offers an objective human portrait of the real Zhou, a man who lived his life at the heart of Chinese politics for fifty years, who survived both the Long March and the Cultural Revolution not thanks to ideological or personal purity, but because he was artful, crafty, and politically supple. He may have had the looks of a matinee idol, and Nixon may have called him ""the greatest statesman of our era,"" but Zhou's greatest gift was to survive, at almost any price, thanks to his acute understanding of where political power resided at any one time.",,,,October 30th 2007,['Zhou Enlai'],Hardcover,,9781586484156,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427633235l/2116379.jpg,3.9,[],97.0,1.0,,,,92.0,245.0,368,PublicAffairs,"['71', '103', '51', '16', '4']",,[],,"['Wenqian Gao', 'Wenqian Gao']"
Zoroastrians' Fight for Survival,,[],"Two vikings – one of whom is the formidable former Varangian Guard whose name is carved on a marble slab in Constantinople's Hagia Sophia – settle down in Kurdland, driven by different objectives. Though broken and defined by the opportunities and challenges imposed on them, they both long for recognition and affection. As their lives intertwine with the enchanting and virtuous doctor, Vesta, the successful Palace manager, Zara, and the newly coronated Kurdish King, Saaid, they try to deal with the inevitable trials of love and loss at a time when uncertainty continues to cloud their future. Well-researched and seductively charming, The Viking's Kurdish Love spans across continents, cultures, religions and decades of tumultuous regional and global history.

Born in a land ravaged by war, she was robbed of her parents when they were murdered by Muslim fundamentalists. Devastated, she fled Kabul with her grandmother and started a new life in exile in Pakistan.
