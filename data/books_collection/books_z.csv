Z. A. Recht;Bowie Ibarra;Travis Adkins,Plague of the Dead,,,Fiction,"The end begins with a viral outbreak unlike anything mankind as ever encountered before. The infected are subject to delirium, fever, a dramatic increase in violent behavior, and a one-hundred percent mortality rate? Death. But it doesn't end there. The victims return from death to walk the earth. When a massive military operation fails to contain the plague of the living dead it escalates into a global pandemic. In one fell swoop, the necessities of life become much more basic. Gone are petty everyday concerns. Gone are the amenities of civilized life. Yet a single law of nature remains: Live, or die. Kill, or be killed. On one side of the world, a battle-hardened General surveys the remnants of his command: a young medic, a veteran photographer, a brash Private, and dozens of refugees, all are his responsibility--all thousands of miles from home.

Z.A. Recht,Thunder and Ashes,,English,,"A lot can change in three months: wars can be decided, nations can be forged... or entire species can be brought to the brink of annihilation. The Morningstar Virus, an incredibly virulent disease, has swept the face of the planet, infecting billions. Its hosts rampage, attacking anything that remains uninfected.

Zack Bowen,Musical Allusions in the Works of James Joyce: Early Poetry Through Ulysses,,English,,"Professor Bowen's book is more than a simple collection of musical allusions; it is an engaging discussion of how Joyce uses music to expand and orchestrate his major themes. The introductions to the separate sections, on each of Joyce's works, express a new and cohesive critical theory and reevaluate the major thematic patterns in the works. The introductory material proceeds to analyze the general workings of music in each particular book. The specific musical references follow, accompanied by their sources and an examination of the role each plays in the work.While the author considers the early works with equal care, the bulk of this volume explores the musical resonances of Ulysses, especially as they affect the style, structure, characterization, and themes. Like motifs in Wagnerian opera, some allusions introduce and later remind us of characters--bits of Molly's songs for instance constantly intrude her impending adultery on Bloom's consciousness. Other motifs are linked to concerns such as Stephen's Oedipal guilt over his mother's death, which in turn connects to his preoccupation with Shakespeare, the creator, the father, and the cuckold. Music helps create the bond which briefly joins Stephen and Bloom, and music augments the entire grand theme of consubstantiality.Professor Bowen's style is simple and clear, allowing Joycean artifice to speak for itself.The volume includes a bibliography.",,,,June 30th 1974,[],Hardcover,[],,9780873952484,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347736880l/554486.jpg,3.6,[],83.0,1.0,,554486.Musical_Allusions_in_the_Works_of_James_Joyce,,,,,100.0,5.0,372,,State University of New York Press,"['1', '1', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”). Samad’s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal’s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith.

She has exposed her legs in a biblical city, an act they deem forbidden, and their judgement will echo on through her adolescence. When our narrator finally admits to her mother that she is queer, her mother’s response only intensifies a sense of shame: “You exist too much,” she tells her daughter.Told in vignettes that flash between the U.S. and the Middle East―from New York to Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine―Zaina Arafat’s debut novel traces her protagonist’s progress from blushing teen to sought-after DJ and aspiring writer. In Brooklyn, she moves into an apartment with her first serious girlfriend and tries to content herself with their comfortable relationship. But soon her longings, so closely hidden during her teenage years, explode out into reckless romantic encounters and obsessions with other people. Her desire to thwart her own destructive impulses will eventually lead her to The Ledge, an unconventional treatment center that identifies her affliction as “love addiction.” In this strange, enclosed society she will start to consider the unnerving similarities between her own internal traumas and divisions and those of the places that have formed her.Opening up the fantasies and desires of one young woman caught between cultural, religious, and sexual identities, You Exist Too Much is a captivating story charting two of our most intense longings―for love, and a place to call home.",,,,June 9th 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Feminism', 'Novels', 'Audiobook']",,9781948226509,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1570133456l/41720140._SY475_.jpg,3.69,[],95.0,1.0,,41720140-you-exist-too-much,,,,,89.0,1623.0,272,,Catapult,"['357', '604', '486', '148', '28']",,,[],,

Zakir Naik,The Quran and Modern Science,,English,,"Ever since the dawn of human life on this planet, Man has always sought to understand Nature, his own place in the scheme of Creation and the purpose of Life itself. In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and determined to a large extent, the course of history. While some religions have been based on books, claimed by their adherents to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience. Al-Qur'an, the main source of the Islamic faith, is a book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains Divine guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur'an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age. Does the Qur'an pass this test? In this booklet, I intend to give an objective analysis of the Muslim belief regarding the Divine origin of the Qur'an, in the light of established scientific discoveries. There was a time, in the history of world civilization, when 'miracles', or what was perceived to be a miracle, took precedence over human reason and logic. But how do we define the term 'miracle'? A miracle is anything that takes place out of the normal course of life and for which humankind has no explanation. However, we must be careful before we accept something as a miracle. An article in `The Times of India', Mumbai, in 1993 reported that 'a saint' by the name 'Baba Pilot' claimed to have stayed continuously submerged under water in a tank for three consecutive days and nights. However, when reporters wanted to examine the base of the tank of water where he claimed to have performed this 'miraculous' feat, he refused to let them do so. He argued by asking as to how one could examine the womb of a mother that gives birth to a child. The `Baba' was hiding something. It as a gimmick simply to gain publicity. Surely, no modern man with even the slightest inkling towards rational thinking would accept such a 'miracle'. If such false miracles are the tests of divinity, then we would have to accept Mr. P.C. Sorcar, the world famous magician known for his ingenious magical tricks and illusions, as the best god-man. A book, claiming Divine origin, is in effect, claiming to be a miracle. Such a claim should be easily verifiable in any age, according to the standards of that age. Muslims believe, that the Qur'an is the last and final revelation of God, the miracle of miracles revealed as a mercy to humankind. This book Quran and Modern Science will investigate the veracity of this belief written by great scholar Dr. Zakir Naik.",,,01/05/01,December 15th 2013,[],,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Philosophy']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395051338l/18782487.jpg,4.43,[],75.0,1.0,,18782487-the-quran-and-modern-science,,,,,92.0,745.0,44,,Darussalam Publishers,"['532', '101', '49', '27', '36']",,,[],,

Zane Grey,Rogue River Feud,,English,,"In the first pages of Rogue River Feud, Grey paints a tantalizing picture of the Rogue from its headwaters to where it spills into the Pacific Ocean.Zane Grey’s vigorous storytelling and portrayal of ... the wild make this novel one of his best. There is a deep emotional feeling for nature in the raw, for the great salmon runs, and for the clashes of men fighting for gold.Along the notorious Rogue River, gold seekers, crazed by the discovery of nuggets that made them rich overnight, are at war with one another. The river itself swarms with salmon, bringing along with them another kind of wealth and violent fighting between fishermen and the fish-packing monopoly. Into this scene comes Keven Bell, returning to face life after being handicapped by a disfiguring wound he received in World War I. Keven teams up with a broken-down fisherman and boatbuilder. When they try to buck the salmon-packing monopoly, they encounter violence and trickery; their boat is sunk and they are left to swim for their lives.Keven is tended to by Beryl, the daughter of a gold miner. His convalescence is slow, but the autumn days, fishing and camping, make a woodland dream of romance. But no sooner has an operation straightened out Keven’s injuries than he is framed on a charge of murder in the salmon-packing war. Keven must carry on as best he can, along with what help Beryl and her old father can give, to clear his name and ensure his and Beryl’s safety on the turbulent Rogue.This text refers to an alternate edition.",,,10/30/29,August 1st 1991,[],Paperback,"['Westerns', 'Fiction']",,9780061002144,,,4.12,[],95.0,1.0,,121367.Rogue_River_Feud,,,,,94.0,389.0,320,,HarperPrism,"['177', '110', '80', '15', '7']",,,[],,
Zane Grey,Riders of the Purple Sage,,,,"Told by a master storyteller who, according to critic Russell Nye, “combined adventure, action, violence, crisis, conflict, sentimentalism, and sex in an extremely shrewd mixture,” Riders of the Purple Sage is a classic of the Western genre. It is the story of Lassiter, a gunslinging avenger in black, who shows up in a remote Utah town just in time to save the young and beautiful rancher Jane Withersteen from having to marry a Mormon elder against her will. Lassiter is on his own quest, one that ends when he discovers a secret grave on Jane’s grounds. “[Zane Grey’s] popularity was neither accidental nor undeserved,” wrote Nye. “Few popular novelists have possessed such a grasp of what the public wanted and few have developed Grey’s skill at supplying it.”",Riders of the Purple Sage #1,,10/30/12,,"['Jim Lassiter', 'Jane Withersteen']",Kindle Edition,"['Westerns', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Literature']",,9780812966121,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328358884l/9459078.jpg,3.71,[],99.0,1.0,,9459078-riders-of-the-purple-sage,,,,,88.0,10147.0,,,,"['2662', '3393', '2906', '878', '308']",,,['Utah (United States)'],,
Zane Grey,The U. P. Trail,,,,"1918. From the master of the western comes a novel full of romance and adventure. The story begins: In the early sixties a trail led from the broad Missouri, swirling yellow and turgid between its green-groved borders, for miles and miles out upon the grassy Nebraska plains, turning westward over the undulating prairie, with its swales and billows and long, winding lines of cottonwoods, to a slow, vast heave of rising ground-Wyoming-where the herds of buffalo grazed and the wolf was lord and the campfire of the trapper sent up its curling blue smoke from beside some lonely stream; on and on over the barren lands of eternal monotony, all so gray and wide and solemn and silent under the endless sky; on, ever on, up to the bleak, black hills and into the waterless gullies and through the rocky gorges where the deer browsed and the savage lurked; then slowly rising to the pass between the great bold peaks, and across the windy uplands into Utah, with its verdant valleys, green as emeralds, and its haze-filled canons and wonderful wind-worn cliffs and walls, and its pale salt lakes, veiled in the shadows of stark and lofty rocks, dim, lilac-colored, austere, and isolated.

Eseje dotyczą przede wszystkim sztuk plastycznych. Autor nie skupia się jednak na wielkich dziełach malarstwa holenderskiego. Zachwyca się jedynie tymi mniej znanymi malarzami, o których w historii sztuki mało napisano. Poznajemy sylwetki Gerarda ter Borach (Terborcha) i Johannesa Torrentiusa. Herbertowskie opisy dzieł z zakresu malarstwa są bogate, zmysłowe i działające na wyobraźnię. Herbert zajmuje się także sprawami społecznymi, poświęcając szkic manii kwiatów - tulipanów.

Zecharia Sitchin's bestselling series The Earth Chronicles provided humanity's side of the story concerning our origins at the hands of the Anunnaki, ""those who from heaven to earth came."" In The Lost Book of Enki we now view this saga from the perspective of Lord Enki, an Anunnaki leader revered in antiquity as a god, who tells the story of these extraterrestrials' arrival on Earth from the planet Nibiru.In his previous works Sitchin compiled the complete story of the Anunnaki's impact on human civilization from fragments scattered throughout Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Egyptian, Canaanite, and Hebrew sources. Missing from these accounts, however, was the perspective of the Anunnaki themselves. What was life like on their own planet? What motives propelled them to settle on Earth - and what drove them from their new home? Convinced of the existence of an actual autobiography of Enki - a lost book that held the answers to these questions - the author began his search for evidence. Through exhaustive research of primary sources, and using actual discovered portions of the ancient text as ""scaffolding,"" he has here re-created the memoirs of Enki, the leader of these first ""astronauts."" What takes shape is the story that begins on another world, a story of mounting tensions, survival dangers and royal succession rivalries, and sophisticated scientific knowledge concerning human origins that is only today being confirmed. An epic tale of gods and men unfolds that parallels the Bible and may challenge every assumption we hold about our past and our future.An eminent Orientalist and Biblical scholar, Zecharia Sitchin is distinquished by his ability to read Sumerian clay tablets and other ancient texts.

Zecharia Sitchin,There Were Giants Upon the Earth,,English,,"The crowning work of the best-selling Earth Chronicles series • Reveals the existence of physical evidence of alien presence on Earth in the distant past • Identifies and describes the demigods, such as Gilgamesh, descended from these visitors • Outlines the tests of this physical evidence of alien presence that could unlock the secrets of health, longevity, life, and death In whose genetic image were we made? From his first book The 12th Planet on, Zecharia Sitchin has asserted that the Bible’s Elohim who said “Let us fashion The Adam in our image and after our likeness” were the gods of Sumer and Babylon--the Anunnaki who had come to Earth from their planet Nibiru. The Adam, he wrote, was genetically engineered by adding Anunnaki genes to those of an existing hominid, some 300,000 years ago. Then, according to the Bible, intermarriage took place: “There were giants upon the Earth” who took Adam’s female offspring as wives, giving birth to “heroes of renown.” With meticulous detail, Sitchin shows that these were the demigods of Sumerian and Babylonian lore, such as the famed Mesopotamian king Gilgamesh as well as the hero of the Deluge, the Babylonian Utnapishtim. Are we then, all of us, descendants of demigods? In this crowning oeuvre, Zecharia Sitchin proceeds step-by-step through a mass of ancient writings and artifacts, leading the reader to the stunning Royal Tombs of Ur. He reveals a DNA source that could prove the biblical and Sumerian tales true, providing conclusive physical evidence for past alien presence on Earth and an unprecedented scientific opportunity to track down the “Missing Link” in humankind’s evolution, unlocking the secrets of longevity and even the ultimate mystery of life and death.",Earth Chronicles #7.5,,01/01/10,May 5th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Aliens', 'Alternate History', 'Philosophy', 'Research', 'Ancient History', 'Science']",,9781591431213,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388178555l/7943089.jpg,4.03,[],98.0,1.0,,7943089-there-were-giants-upon-the-earth,,,,,92.0,462.0,352,,Bear Company,"['189', '148', '86', '29', '10']",,,[],,

Zing Tsjeng,Forgotten Women: The Artists,,,,"Forgotten Women is a new series of books that uncover the lost herstories of influential women who have refused over hundreds of years to accept the hand they've been dealt and, as a result, have formed, shaped and changed the course of our futures. From leaders and scientists to artists and writers, the fascinating stories of these women that time forgot are now celebrated, putting their achievements firmly back on the map.The Artists brings together the stories of 48* brilliant woman artists who made huge yet unacknowledged contributions to the history of art, including Camille Claudel, the extraordinarily talented sculptor who was always unfairly overshadowed by her lover, Rodin; Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, who has been claimed as the true originator of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain; and Ana Mendieta, the Cuban refugee who approached violence against women through her performance art before her own untimely death.With chapters ranging from Figurative to Photography, and Craft to Conceptual, this is an alternative guide to art history that demonstrates the broad range of artistic movements that included, and were often pioneered by, female artists who have been largely overlooked.*The number of Nobel-prize-winning women.",Forgotten Women,,,October 2nd 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Art', 'History']",,9781788400633,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1536209129l/38509967._SX318_.jpg,4.29,[],100.0,1.0,,38509967-forgotten-women,,,,,96.0,52.0,224,,Cassell,"['21', '27', '2', '2', '0']",,,[],,

Ziya Tong (Goodreads Author),"The Reality Bubble: Blind Spots, Hidden Truths, and the Dangerous Illusions That Shape Our World",,,,"From one of the world's most engaging science journalists, a groundbreaking and wonder-filled look at the hidden things that shape our lives in unexpected and sometimes dangerous ways.Our naked eyes see only a thin sliver of reality.We are blind in comparison to the X-rays that peer through skin, the mass spectrometers that detect the dead inside the living, or the high-tech surveillance systems that see with artificial intelligence.And we are blind compared to the animals that can see in infrared, or ultraviolet, or in 360-degree vision. These animals live in the same world we do, but they see something quite different when they look around.With all of the curiosity and flair that drives her broadcasting, Ziya Tong illuminates this hidden world, and takes us on a journey to examine ten of humanity's biggest blind spots.First, we are introduced to the blind spots we are all born with, to see how technology reveals an astonishing world that exists beyond our human senses. It is with these new ways of seeing that today's scientists can image everything from an atom to a black hole.In Section Two, our collective blind spots are exposed. It's not that we can't see, Tong reminds us. It's that we don't. In the 21st century, there are cameras everywhere, except where our food comes from, where our energy comes from, and where our waste goes. Being in the dark when it comes to how we survive makes it impossible to navigate our future.Lastly, the scope widens to our civilizational blind spots. Here, the blurred lens of history reveals how we inherit ways of thinking about the world that seem natural or inevitable but are in fact little more than traditions, ways of seeing the world that have come to harm it.This vitally important new book shows how science, and the curiosity that drives it, can help civilization flourish by opening our eyes to the landscape laid out before us.

I wondered about it, then asked a varied group of people why this was true, if indeed they subscribed to my thoughts and they all have different opinions about the topic. We all have hidden passions, some people become slaves to theirs and later manifest themselves into their reality. These women who admit to numerous affairs with younger men between the ages of nineteen to twenty-seven have had life to live behind the curtains.""I always feel like their teacher - like I was really contributing something to them - and that's probably why I come so great with them."" A psychologist, faculty member at a named College in California mentioned: ""These affairs were once traditional among some cultures, and still are to a large degree. The reason? Well, there are many, some peculiar to the individuals involved which limits any generalizations, but I would say there are some basic reasons that are involved in some manner in most of these cases.""For the women - they feel effective with the young, even 'powerful' with some elements of maternalism expressed through this manifestation.” And for the young men; consciously, the mature woman is a 'safe' yet desirable partner, while on the unconscious level they are serving Oedipal leanings."" ""Because they're the easiest to make - nothing's involved except being ready when she is. And not getting caught!"" the young men would say.""…they are going to be so hurt by the world that they need my love now.""

Zoe Jasmine,Stepfather Affair,,,,"The summer sun beat heavily on the tiny inlet off the broad river. Large trees, untouched by civilization, surrounded the inlet on three sides. The fourth side was a narrow waterway leading back to the river. Wild birds abounded, and on land, small game lived without fear of being attacked and killed by larger animals. Nor did they fear the worst predator of all: man. It was too early for mosquitoes. Everything was quiet and peaceful.The little cabin cruiser sat silently in the middle of the inlet, at anchor.

They had rented the cabin cruiser for two days, and Herb Rheingold had found the inlet quite by accident.At the moment, Herb, his wife Emily, and Emily's daughter by a previous marriage, Wendy, were relaxing on deck. Emily, tall, slender, with jet-black hair, had an excellent figure, and didn't mind showing it off wearing the briefest of bikinis.Her bikini was as black as her ebony hair, hiding her dark bush of pubic curls, though the hairs did stick out around the sides of the crotch band.

Zoe Mason King (Goodreads Author),Building Mount Everest,,English,,"World War II has ended but British colonial traditions are silently at war with an Australia whose identity is maturing relentlessly. This network of tales is told by a near-sighted child, half-British, half-European, certain she can make peace in her family and within the culture. Neither her culture nor her family is ready for peace. This haunting novel spans wars, continents, and the Great Depression. It spins a strange future from old loves, loyalties, and secrets. A free-spirited bride shapes herself into convention. A grandparent's death reaches across time and continents. An officer faces civilian life. A mother betrays her daughter. Reality is more dangerous than imagination; religion, than sex. Reserve shrouds fact and prejudice. A sweater, glasses, letter, shard: each changes the course of a life. A girls’ school breeds strictures, loves, betrayals. A religious meeting forces impossible choices. A mother’s secret, long held, ordains a daughter’s life. A grasshopper, moth, puppy: each can end a childhood and unfold truths and passions, rarely simple. Throughout, the great heart of Australia beats in each life and decision.

Zora Neale Hurston,"Barracoon: The Story of the Last ""Black Cargo""",,English,,"In 1927, Zora Neale Hurston went to Plateau, Alabama, just outside Mobile, to interview eighty-six-year-old Cudjo Lewis. Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation's history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo's firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo's past--memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo's unique vernacular, and written from Hurston's perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.",,,04/24/18,May 8th 2018,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'Africa', 'African American', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Anti Racist']",,9780060921705,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524663392l/2590136._SY475_.jpg,4.03,"['Nautilus Book Award for Multicultural & Indigenous (Gold) (2019)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2018)', 'NAACP Image Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2019)']",193.0,2.0,,2590136-barracoon,,,,,95.0,19479.0,193,,HarperCollins Publishers,"['6571', '8102', '3874', '691', '241']",,,[],,

Zoë Ferraris (Goodreads Author),Finding Nouf,,English,,"A novel of taut psychological suspense, offering an unprecedented window into Saudi Arabia and the lives of the men and women who live there.Zoë Ferraris’s electrifying debut of taut psychological suspense offers an unprecedented window into Saudi Arabia and the lives of men and women there. When sixteen-year-old Nouf goes missing, along with a truck and her favorite camel, her prominent family calls on Nayir al-Sharqi, a desert guide, to lead a search party. Ten days later, just as Nayir is about to give up in frustration, her body is discovered by anonymous desert travelers. But when the coroner’s office determines that Nouf died not of dehydration but from drowning, and her family seems suspiciously uninterested in getting at the truth, Nayir takes it upon himself to find out what really happened to her. This mission will push gentle, hulking, pious Nayir, a Palestinian orphan raised by his bachelor uncle, to delve into the secret life of a rich, protected teenage girl -- in one of the most rigidly gender-segregated of Middle Eastern societies. Initially horrified at the idea of a woman bold enough to bare her face and to work in public, Nayir soon realizes that if he wants to gain access to the hidden world of women, he will have to join forces with Katya Hijazi, a lab worker at the coroner’s office. Their partnership challenges Nayir, bringing him face to face with his desire for female companionship and the limitations imposed by his beliefs. It also ultimately leads them both to surprising revelations. Fast-paced and utterly transporting, Finding Nouf offers an intimate glimpse inside a closed society and a riveting literary mystery.
