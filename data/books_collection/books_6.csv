Quando desperta da delicada cirurgia a que foi entretanto submetida tem perante si a difícil tarefa de recuperar a sua própria identidade, já que a violência de que foi vítima lhe provocou a perda da memória. As recordações avivam-se pouco a pouco e é penosamente que ela recompõe a sua história e a da sua família.
