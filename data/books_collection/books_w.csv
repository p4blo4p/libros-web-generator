Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment.According to W. Edwards Deming, American companies require nothing less than a transformation of management style and of governmental relations with industry. In Out of the Crisis, originally published in 1982, Deming offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future, he claims, brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved product and service.

W. Mark Ormrod,Edward III,,English,,"Edward III (1312–1377) was the most successful European ruler of his age. Reigning for over fifty years, he achieved spectacular military triumphs and overcame grave threats to his authority, from parliamentary revolt to the Black Death. Revered by his subjects as a chivalric dynamo, he initiated the Hundred Years' War and gloriously led his men into battle against the Scots and the French.In this illuminating biography, W. Mark Ormrod takes a deeper look at Edward to reveal the man beneath the military muscle. What emerges is Edward's clear sense of his duty to rebuild the prestige of the Crown, and through military gains and shifting diplomacy, to secure a legacy for posterity. New details of the splendor of Edward's court, lavish national celebrations, and innovative use of imagery establish the king's instinctive understanding of the bond between ruler and people. With fresh emphasis on how Edward's rule was affected by his family relationships—including his roles as traumatized son, loving husband, and dutiful father—Ormrod gives a valuable new dimension to our understanding of this remarkable warrior king.",The English Monarchs,,08/26/11,January 24th 2012,['Edward III of England'],Hardcover,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Medieval History', 'Medieval', 'British Literature', 'European History']",,9780300119107,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356352413l/11461997.jpg,4.26,[],100.0,1.0,,11461997-edward-iii,,,,,97.0,90.0,720,,Yale University Press,"['42', '33', '12', '2', '1']",,,[],,

W. Paul Anderson,Hunger's Brides,,English,,"An epic novel of genius and obsession — apocalyptic, lyrical and erotically charged. Spanning three centuries and two cultures, Hunger’s Brides brings to vivid life the greatest Spanish poet of her time, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, and plumbs a mystery that has intrigued writers as diverse as Robert Graves, Diane Ackerman, Eduardo Galeano and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Why did a writer of such gifts silence herself?At the time of her death in 1695, Juana Inés de la Cruz was arguably the greatest writer working in any European tongue, yet she had never set foot in Europe. Instead she was born among the descendants of the Aztec empire, in the shadow of the mountain pass Cortés and his troops descended on their advance to Montezuma’s capital. A child prodigy from a barbarous wilderness, her beauty and wit provoked a sensation at the viceregal court in Mexico City. But at the age of nineteen, still a favourite of the court, Juana entered a convent, and from that point her life unfolded between the mystery of her sudden flight from palace to cloister, and the enigma of her final vow of silence, signed in blood. After a quarter-century of graceful, often sensuous poetry, plays and theological argument, Sor Juana chose silence, which she maintained until she died of plague at the age of forty-five.Drawing on chronicles of the conquest and histories of the Inquisition, myth cycles and archeological studies, ancient poetry and early Spanish accounts of blood sacrifice, Hunger’s Brides is a mammoth work of inspired historical fiction framed in a contemporary mystery. In the dead of a Calgary winter night, a man escapes from an apartment in which a young woman lies bleeding — in his arms he clutches a box he has found on her table addressed to him. He is Donald Gregory, a once-respected, now-disgraced, academic. She is Beulah Limosneros, one of his students, and for a brief time his lover. Brilliant, erratic, voracious, she had disappeared two years earlier in Mexico, following the thread of her growing obsession with Sor Juana. Over the ensuing days and weeks, as a police investigation closes in around him, Gregory pieces together the contents of the box she has left him: a poetic journal of her travel in Mexico, diaries, research notes, unposted letters, and a strange manuscript — part biography, part novel — on Sor Juana.Hunger’s Brides is a dramatic unveiling of three intimate journeys: a man’s forced march to self-knowledge, a great poet’s withdrawal from the world, and a profane mystic’s pilgrimage into modern Mexico, in which the bones of the past constantly poke through a present built on the ruins of the vanquished.Excerpt from Hunger’s Brides“From the moment I was first illuminated by the light of reason, my inclination toward letters has been so vehement that not even the admonitions of others . . . nor my own meditations have been sufficient to cause me to forswear this natural impulse that God placed in me . . . that inclination exploded in me like gunpowder. . . .” —Sor Juana, in a letter of self-defence written to a bishop in 1691, just before she took a vow of silenceFrom the Hardcover edition.",,,11/06/04,July 27th 2011,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Suspense', '21st Century', 'Literature', 'Mystery', '17th Century', 'Unfinished', 'Canada', 'Religion']",,9780679312000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1190150361l/1907716._SX318_.jpg,3.66,[],93.0,1.0,,1907716.Hunger_s_Brides,,,,,81.0,140.0,1376,,Vintage Canada,"['47', '39', '28', '11', '15']",,,[],,

"W.B. Yeats, Macha Louis Rosenthal",Selected Poems and Four Plays,,English,,"Since its first appearance in 1962, M. L. Rosenthal's classic selection of Yeats's poems and plays has attracted hundreds of thousands of readers. This newly revised edition includes 211 poems and 4 plays. It adds The Words Upon the Window-Pane, one of Yeats's most startling dramatic works in its realistic use of a seance as the setting for an eerily powerful reenactment of Jonathan Swift's rigorous idealism, baffling love relationships, and tragic madness. The collection profits from recent scholarship that has helped to establish Yeats's most reliable texts, in the order set by the poet himself. And his powerful lyrical sequences are amply represented, culminating in the selection from Last Poems and Two Plays, which reaches its climax in the brilliant poetic plays The Death of Cuchulain and Purgatory.  Scholars, students, and all who delight in Yeats's varied music and sheer quality will rejoice in this expanded edition. As the introduction observes, ""Early and late he has the simple, indispensable gift of enchanting the ear....He was also the poet who, while very much of his own day in Ireland, spoke best to the people of all countries. And though he plunged deep into arcane studies, his themes are most clearly the general ones of life and death, love and hate, man's condition, and history's meanings. He began as a sometimes effete post-Romantic, heir to the pre-Raphaelites, and then, quite naturally, became a leading British Symbolist; but he grew at last into the boldest, most vigorous voice of this century.""

The raising of the remains of R.M.S. Titanic from its watery grave miles beneath the North Atlantic would be the key to opening up a door to a not too distant past. Found in the decaying structure would be a lockbox that would eventually lead to a series of long lost diaries written by Elizabeth Brunnette.

He also charges that the strategy of accommodation to white supremacy advanced by Booker T.

W.G. Sebald,On the Natural History of Destruction,,English,,"W.G. Sebald completed this controversial book before his death in December 2001. On the Natural History of Destruction is his harrowing and precise investigation of one of the least examined silences of our time. In it, the novelist examines the devastation of German cities by Allied bombardment and the reasons for the astonishing absence of this unprecedented trauma from German history and culture. This historical void is in part a repression of things -- such as the death by fire of the city of Hamburg at the hands of the RAF -- too terrible to bear. But rather than record the crises about them, writers sought to retrospectively justify their actions under the Nazis. For Sebald, this is an example of deliberate cultural amnesia. His analysis of its effects in and outside Germany has already provoked angry painful debate. Sebald's novels are rooted in meticulous observation. His essays are novelistic. They include his childhood recollections of the war that spurred his horror at the collective amnesia around him. There are moments of black humor and, throughout, the sensitivity of his intelligence. This book is a study of suffering and forgetting, of the morality hidden in artistic decisions, and of both compromised and genuine heroics.",,,11/06/99,March 4th 2004,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Germany', 'War', 'German Literature', 'World War II', 'Literature', 'Literary Criticism', 'Writing']",,9780140298000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1460374314l/183922.jpg,4.01,[],58.0,1.0,,183922.On_the_Natural_History_of_Destruction,,,,,95.0,2007.0,205,,Penguin MD,"['651', '853', '400', '83', '20']",,,[],,

"W.H.

Ci sono buone ragioni se i versi del poeta oscillano tra la più intensa tenerezza e parossismi di indifferenza, e se da queste oscillazioni nasce uno stridente lirismo che non ha precedenti». Così scrive Brodskij presentando queste dieci poesie di W.H. Auden. Composte negli anni Trenta, e impregnate di un angoscioso «odore del futuro», esse parlano dell’amore nella varietà dei suoi stati, dall’esaltazione alla desolazione. Con un vago tono di ballata sul fondo, e quasi sfidando una musica a seguirli, questi versi hanno un «timbro tagliente» che incide le parole nella mente annientando ogni ostacolo. Li abbiamo appena letti che già navigano nella nostra circolazione, come qualcosa di intimo e insieme remoto. Accade di rado con la poesia di questo secolo – e non meraviglia che numerosissimi lettori li abbiano scoperti di recente: forse da tempo, senza saperlo, li stavano cercando.

"Wallace Breem, Steven Pressfield (Goodreads Author) (Introduction)",Eagle in the Snow: A Novel of General Maximus and Rome's Last Stand,,English,,"Banished to the Empire's farthest outpost, veteran warrior Paulinus Maximus defends The Wall of Britannia from the constant onslaught of belligerent barbarian tribes. Bravery, loyalty, experience, and success lead to Maximus' appointment as ""General of the West"" by the Roman emperor, the ambition of a lifetime. But with the title comes a caveat: Maximus needs to muster and command a single legion to defend the perilous Rhine frontier. On the opposite side of the Rhine River, tribal nations are uniting; hundreds of thousands mass in preparation for the conquest of Gaul, and from there, a sweep down into Rome itself. Only a wide river and a wily general keep them in check.  With discipline, deception, persuasion, and surprise, Maximus holds the line against an increasingly desperate and innumerable foe. Friends, allies, and even enemies urge Maximus to proclaim himself emperor. He refuses, bound by an oath of duty, honor, and sacrifice to Rome, a city he has never seen. But then circumstance intervenes. Now, Maximus will accept the purple robe of emperor, if his scrappy legion can deliver this last crucial victory against insurmountable odds. The very fate of Rome hangs in the balance. Combining the brilliantly realized battle action of Gates of Fire and the masterful characterization of Mary Renault's The Last of the Wine, Eagle in the Snow is nothing less than the novel of the fall of the Roman empire.",,,10/28/70,February 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Roman', 'War', 'Ancient', 'Military Fiction', 'Literature', 'Germany', 'Ancient History']",,9781590710203,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461203834l/484192.jpg,4.12,[],456.0,5.0,,484192.Eagle_in_the_Snow,,,,,94.0,2334.0,400,,Rugged Land Books,"['980', '833', '382', '103', '36']",,,[],,

You have within you the ability to get whatever you want! Prosperity guru Wallace D. Wattles reveals how to tap into this secret power to channel the abundance of the universe and make all your dreams a reality. His method is simple and straightforward, yet it opens up a world where opportunity is limitless, where we control of our own destiny, and where there are scientific answers to life’s great philosophical and religious questions. The Science of Success contains three prosperity classics in a single volume, and all in color, including Wattles’s most famous, The Science of Getting Rich, featured prominently in Rhonda Byrne’s bestselling The Secret.

Wallace D. Wattles,The Science of Getting Rich,,English,,"As featured in the bestselling book The Secret, here is the landmark guide to wealth creation republished with the classic essay “How to Get What You Want.” Wallace D. Wattles spent a lifetime considering the laws of success as he found them in the work of the world’s great philosophers. He then turned his life effort into this simple, slender book – a volume that he vowed could replace libraries of philosophy, spirituality, and self-help for the purpose of attaining one definite goal: a life of prosperity. Wattles describes a definite science of wealth attraction, built on the foundation of one commanding idea: “There is a thinking stuff from which all things are madeâ€¦A thought, in this substance, produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.” In his seventeen short, straight-to-the-point chapters, Wattles shows how to use this idea, how to overcome barriers to its application, and how work with very direct methods that awaken it in your life. He further explains how creation and not competition is the hidden key to wealth attraction, and how your power to get rich uplifts everyone around you. The Science of Getting Rich concludes with Wattle’s rare essay “How to Get Want You Want” – a brilliant refresher of his laws of wealth creation.

While visiting a poverty-stricken country far from home, the unnamed narrator of The Fever is forced to witness the political persecution occurring just beyond a hotel window. In examining a life of comfort and relative privilege, the narrator reveals, “I always say to my friends, We should be glad to be alive. We should celebrate life. We should understand that life is wonderful.” But how does one celebrate life—take pleasure in beauty, for instance—while slowly becoming aware that the poverty and oppression of other human beings are a direct consequence of one’s own pleasurable life? In a coruscating monologue, The Fever is most of all an eloquent meditation on whether it is possible to live in an ethical relationship with others in the world.",,,01/01/91,January 27th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'Theatre', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Cultural']",,9780802140708,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328822255l/243245.jpg,4.19,['Obie for Best New American Play (1991)'],77.0,1.0,,243245.The_Fever,,,,,95.0,476.0,80,,Grove Press,"['212', '171', '70', '19', '4']",,,[],,

Wally Lamb (Goodreads Author),The Hour I First Believed,,English,,"Wally Lamb's two previous novels, She's Come Undone and I Know This Much Is True, struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. In The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface. As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy.

Wally Lamb (Goodreads Author),We Are Water,,English,,"In middle age, Annie Oh—wife, mother, and outsider artist—has shaken her family to its core. After twenty-seven years of marriage and three children, Annie has fallen in love with Viveca, the wealthy, cultured, confident Manhattan art dealer who orchestrated her professional success.Annie and Viveca plan to wed in the Oh family's hometown of Three Rivers, Connecticut, where gay marriage has recently been legalized. But the impending wedding provokes some very mixed reactions and opens a Pandora's box of toxic secrets—dark and painful truths that have festered below the surface of the Ohs' lives.We Are Water is an intricate and layered portrait of marriage, family, and the inexorable need for understanding and connection, told in the alternating voices of the Ohs—nonconformist Annie; her ex-husband, Orion, a psychologist; Ariane, the do-gooder daughter, and her twin, Andrew, the rebellious only son; and free-spirited Marissa, the youngest Oh. Set in New England and New York during the first years of the Obama presidency, it is also a portrait of modern America, exploring issues of class, changing social mores, the legacy of racial violence, and the nature of creativity and art.With humor and breathtaking compassion, Wally Lamb brilliantly captures the essence of human experience in vivid and unforgettable characters struggling to find hope and redemption in the aftermath of trauma and loss. We Are Water is vintage Wally Lamb—a compulsively readable, generous, and uplifting masterpiece that digs deep into the complexities of the human heart to explore the ways in which we search for love and meaning in our lives.",,,,October 22nd 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Book Club']",,9780061941023,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361329815l/17349023.jpg,3.81,"['Lambda Literary Award Nominee for Lesbian General Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)']",194.0,2.0,,17349023-we-are-water,,,,,91.0,49001.0,561,,Harper,"['12387', '20355', '11901', '3209', '1149']",,,[],,

Walt Morey,Year of the Black Pony,,English,,"The Fellows family has joined numerous others striving to make a go of homesteading in the Oregon high desert. But the venture has been disastrous from the start. Mr. Fellows, who is not a farmer, resents any advice from his wife, who grew up on a farm. Ma is not only troubled about the farming, but 7-year-old Ellie s chronic illness has become a source of constant worry and expense. 12-year-old Chris, who cannot seem to please his father no matter what he does, eases his own misery by stealing time away from work to watch a neighbor s scarcely broken black pony, only to get into more trouble. When it seems circumstances could not get worse for the struggling family, Fellows gets drunk and dies. Not willing to give up, Ma stubbornly and creatively seeks a way for the family to stay in Oregon. Frank Chase, an unintentional element in the death of Chris s father, is added to the mix and challenged by Ma to keep his word to help the family. The resultant dramatic and sometimes humorous contest of wills comes to a satisfying culmination when, after Frank s purchase of the wild black pony for Chris, Ma is reluctantly forced to once again use her backbone of steel for the good of all. Walt Morey s careful research and vivid storytelling talent warmly bring to life the struggles and triumphs of homesteading in the Oregon high desert country in the early 1900 s.

Today it is regarded as a landmark of American literature.This volume contains 24 poems from Leaves of Grass, offering a generous sampling of Whitman's best and most representative verses.

Conceived in Paris in 1927 and still in progress when Benjamin fled the Occupation in 1940, The Arcades Project (in German, Das Passagen-Werk) is a monumental ruin, meticulously constructed over the course of thirteen years--""the theater,"" as Benjamin called it, ""of all my struggles and all my ideas.""Focusing on the arcades of nineteenth-century Paris-glass-roofed rows of shops that were early centers of consumerism--Benjamin presents a montage of quotations from, and reflections on, hundreds of published sources, arranging them in thirty-six categories with descriptive rubrics such as ""Fashion,"" ""Boredom,"" ""Dream City,"" ""Photography,"" ""Catacombs,"" ""Advertising,"" ""Prostitution,"" ""Baudelaire,"" and ""Theory of Progress."" His central preoccupation is what he calls the commodification of things--a process in which he locates the decisive shift to the modern age.The Arcades Project is Benjamin's effort to represent and to critique the bourgeois experience of nineteenth-century history, and, in so doing, to liberate the suppressed ""true history"" that underlay the ideological mask. In the bustling, cluttered arcades, street and interior merge and historical time is broken up into kaleidoscopic distractions and displays of ephemera.

A Harlem drugstore owner was shot and killed in his store, and the word is that Steve served as the lookout.Guilty or innocent, Steve becomes a pawn in the hands of ""the system,"" cluttered with cynical authority figures and unscrupulous inmates, who will turn in anyone to shorten their own sentences. For the first time, Steve is forced to think about who he is as he faces prison, where he may spend all the tomorrows of his life.As a way of coping with the horrific events that entangle him, Steve, an amateur filmmaker, decides to transcribe his trial into a script, just like in the movies. He writes it all down, scene by scene, the story of how his whole life was turned around in an instant. But despite his efforts, reality is blurred and his vision obscured until he can no longer tell who he is or what is the truth.

Walter Isaacson (Goodreads Author),Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,,English,,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",,,07/01/03,June 2004,['Benjamin Franklin'],Paperback,"['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Politics', 'American Revolution', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Business']",,9780743258074,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397772877l/10883.jpg,4.0,[],163.0,2.0,,10883.Benjamin_Franklin,,,,,91.0,113854.0,586,,Simon & Schuster,"['45776', '38423', '19079', '5526', '5050']",,,['United States of America'],,

Walter Isaacson (Goodreads Author),Steve Jobs,,English,,"Walter Isaacson's ""enthralling"" (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.

For years, no remedy--not orthodontia, not the escalating threats of his father, Mike, a washed-out linebacker turned sporting goods entrepreneur, not the noxious cayenne pepper-based Suk-No-Mor--can cure Justin's thumbsucking habit.Then a course of hypnosis seemingly does the trick, but true to the conservation of neurotic energy, the problem doesn't so much disappear as relocate. Sex, substance abuse, speech team, fly-fishing, honest work, even Mormonism--Justin throws himself into each pursuit with a hyperactive energy that even his daily Ritalin dose does little to blunt.Each time, however, he discovers that there is no escaping the unruly imperatives of his self and the confines of his deeply eccentric family.

"Walter Lewin, Warren Goldstein (Contributor)",For the Love of Physics: From the End of the Rainbow to the Edge of Time - A Journey Through the Wonders of Physics,,English,,"“YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE” is a common refrain in the emails Walter Lewin receives daily from fans who have been enthralled by his world-famous video lectures about the wonders of physics. “I walk with a new spring in my step and I look at life through physics-colored eyes,” wrote one such fan. When Lewin’s lectures were made available online, he became an instant YouTube celebrity, and The New York Times declared, “Walter Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits.” For more than thirty years as a beloved professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lewin honed his singular craft of making physics not only accessible but truly fun, whether putting his head in the path of a wrecking ball, supercharging himself with three hundred thousand volts of electricity, or demonstrating why the sky is blue and why clouds are white. Now, as Carl Sagan did for astronomy and Brian Green did for cosmology, Lewin takes readers on a marvelous journey in For the Love of Physics, opening our eyes as never before to the amazing beauty and power with which physics can reveal the hidden workings of the world all around us. “I introduce people to their own world,” writes Lewin, “the world they live in and are familiar with but don’t approach like a physicist—yet.” Could it be true that we are shorter standing up than lying down? Why can we snorkel no deeper than about one foot below the surface? Why are the colors of a rainbow always in the same order, and would it be possible to put our hand out and touch one? Whether introducing why the air smells so fresh after a lightning storm, why we briefly lose (and gain) weight when we ride in an elevator, or what the big bang would have sounded like had anyone existed to hear it, Lewin never ceases to surprise and delight with the extraordinary ability of physics to answer even the most elusive questions. Recounting his own exciting discoveries as a pioneer in the field of X-ray astronomy—arriving at MIT right at the start of an astonishing revolution in astronomy—he also brings to life the power of physics to reach into the vastness of space and unveil exotic uncharted territories, from the marvels of a supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud to the unseeable depths of black holes. “For me,” Lewin writes, “physics is a way of seeing—the spectacular and the mundane, the immense and the minute—as a beautiful, thrillingly interwoven whole.” His wonderfully inventive and vivid ways of introducing us to the revelations of physics impart to us a new appreciation of the remarkable beauty and intricate harmonies of the forces that govern our lives.",,,,May 3rd 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Education', 'Biography', 'Popular Science', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Mathematics', 'History']",,9781439108277,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438420090l/7841672._SY475_.jpg,4.24,[],94.0,1.0,,7841672-for-the-love-of-physics,,,,,97.0,2992.0,301,,Free Press,"['1338', '1145', '419', '67', '23']",,,[],,

Walter Moers,Ensel und Krete. Ein Märchen aus Zamonien,,German,,"Urlaub mit den Eltern kann so langweilig sein. Die beiden Fhernhachen-Kinder Ensel und Krete erleben das am eigenen Leibe, als sie mit ihren Eltern den zamonischen Großen Wald bereisen. Dabei hatten sie gehofft, dort endlich einmal etwas zu erleben! Und so ziehen sie auf eigene Faust los, um das Abenteuer zu suchen, verlaufen sich jedoch nach kurzer Zeit. Damit nimmt ein rasantes Märchenabenteuer seinen Lauf, bei dem selbst den Gebrüdern Grimm bald die Puste ausgegangen wäre. Die beiden Zwergenkinder treffen auf zahlreiche gefährliche oder einfach nur sonderbare Geschöpef: einen Laubwolf, Erdgnömchen, Geheimbären, Fledertratten, Schuhus, Einhörnchen, einen sprechenden Meteor und allerlei andere Seltsamkeiten. Natürlich finden auch ein Hexenhaus, und der fantasievolle Showdown hat mehr mit dem Blair Witch Project als mit unseren alten Hausmärchen gemeinsam. Erzählt wird die Geschichte übrigens vom berüchtigsten Dichter Zamoniens, Hildegunst von Mythenmetz, einem tausend Jahre alten, aufrecht gehenden Zwergsaurier, der die Handlung -- meist an ihren spannendsten Stellen -- unterbricht, um weiterführende Erläuterungen zu geben, die sogar noch interessanter und witziger sind als die Handlung selbst. Diesem Stilmittel lieh der Dichter sogar seinen Namen: die ""Mythenmetzsche Abschweifung"". Und so erfährt man ganz nebenbei haarsträubende Details über zamonische Zahlensysteme, die sieben Grundtugenden des Dichters oder auch Insiderinformationen über den zamonischen Literaturbetrieb. Abgerundet wird das Buch durch die halbe Biografie des Hildegunst von Mythenmetz unter dem Titel ""Von der Lindwurmfeste zum Bloxberg"". Auf die Frage, wieso dieses Buch keine direkte Fortsetzung von Die 13 1/2 Leben des Käpt'n Blaubär sei, antwortete Walter Moers: ""Das hat verschiedene Gründe. Erstens glaube ich, dass ein Buch mit über 700 Seiten für eine Figur genügen sollte. Zweitens war für mich schon beim ersten Buch der eigentliche Held nicht der Blaubär, sondern der Kontinent Zamonien. Dessen Geschichte -- und die seiner Bewohner -- möchte ich weitererzählen, in alle möglichen Richtungen."" Und so besteht die Hoffnung, dass es auch weitere Zamonien-Bücher geben wird, selbst wenn Walter Moers die zweiten 13 1/2 Leben des Käpt'n Blaubär im Dunklen lässt. --Hardy Kettlitz",Zamonien #2,,06/28/00,July 3rd 2002,"['Ensel', 'Krete']",Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Young Adult', 'Novels', 'Roman', 'Audiobook', 'Fairy Tales', 'Childrens']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170598805l/62035.jpg,3.72,[],94.0,1.0,,62035.Ensel_und_Krete_Ein_M_rchen_aus_Zamonien,,,,,91.0,4034.0,256,,Goldmann,"['884', '1528', '1270', '309', '43']",,,['Zamonia'],,

Walter Mosley,Known to Evil,,English,,"Leonid McGill knows something suspicious is going on as soon as the phone rings—no one calls him at this number. Alphonse Rinaldo, New York City’s ultimate fixer, the one man with a hand in every dark decision made in the five boroughs, has a problem that he needs McGill’s help to handle. What Rinaldo can’t accomplish on his own, McGill doesn’t really want to know. But Rinaldo’s not a client a Manhattan private eye can say no to, so McGill runs uptown to check on the young woman Rinaldo is worried about. McGill’s hardly pleased, but not especially surprised, when he walks into the middle of a murder scene—and, thanks to his nefarious past, winds up as the NYPD’s prime suspect.Everyone’s motives are murky in McGill’s world; that, he’s used to. What he’s not quite accustomed to is his own recent commitment to the straight and narrow, a path that still seems to lead him directly to the city’s crookedest corners and down its darkest alleys. When Rinaldo won’t let McGill drop the case, or reveal his connection to the young woman in question—simply insisting that she must be found—McGill strikes a dangerous deal with himself: he’ll find the girl, but he’s not going to hand her over until he knows all there is to know about her, and why exactly Rinaldo’s so interested.And so McGill plunges deep into contemporary New York City as only Walter Mosley can expose it, navigating an underworld that—just beneath the glitz and glamour, hidden behind the safe, clean streets—pulses with danger and violence. This is where McGill plies his trade, and it’s from this that he’s determined to protect all that he’s come to love: his family, his friends, his soul—all of which seem determined to put themselves in harm’s way. To achieve all of this, he’ll have to make new alliances with the darkest, most dangerous acquaintances of his past. And if he can survive both his friends and his enemies with his charm and charisma intact, Leonid McGill will truly have earned his designation as the twenty-first century’s iconic noir hero.",Leonid McGill #2,,10/30/10,March 23rd 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Detective', 'African American', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Thriller', 'Noir', 'Audiobook']",,9781594487521,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348698669l/6608160.jpg,3.91,[],96.0,1.0,,6608160-known-to-evil,,,,,95.0,2183.0,326,,Riverhead Books,"['553', '998', '533', '82', '17']",,,[],,
Walter Mosley,"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned",,English,,"In this cycle of 14 bittersweet stories, Walter Mosley breaks out of the genre--if not the setting--of his bestselling Easy Rawlins detective novels. Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles, drinks and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless rage--as well as the power of his massive ""rock-breaking"" hands--Socrates must find a way to live an honourable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task which takes every ounce of self-control he has.  Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighbourhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both lyrical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.",Socrates Fortlow #1,,,1997,['Socrates Fortlow'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Mystery', 'African American', 'Crime', 'Literature', 'Mystery Thriller', 'American', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction']",,9781852427023,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348622123l/84557.jpg,4.17,['Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (1998)'],73.0,1.0,,84557.Always_Outnumbered_Always_Outgunned,,,,,97.0,3607.0,208,,Serpent's Tail,"['1428', '1481', '589', '93', '16']",,,[],,

Walter Noble Burns,The Saga of Billy the Kid,,English,,"First published in 1926, this entertaining and dramatic biography forever installed outlaw Billy the Kid in the pantheon of mythic heroes from the Old West and is still considered the single most influential portrait of Billy in this century. Saga focuses on the Kid's life and experiences in the bloody war between the Murphy-Dolan and Tunstall-McSween gangs in and around Lincoln, New Mexico, between 1878 and 1881. Burns paints the Kid as a boyish Robin Hood or romantic knight galvanized into a life of crime and killing by the war's violence and bloodshed. Billy represented the romantic and anarchic Old West that the march of civilization was rapidly displacing. His destroyer was Pat Garrett, the courageous sheriff of Lincoln County. Garrett's shooting of Billy in 1881 hastened the closing of the American frontier. Walter Noble Burns's Saga of Billy the Kid kindled a fascination in Billy the Kid that survives to this day.

"Walter Payton, Don Yaeger",Never Die Easy: The Autobiography of Walter Payton,,English,,"""Never die easy. Why run out of bounds and die easy? Make that linebacker pay. It carries into all facets of your life. It's okay to lose, to die, but don't die without trying, without giving it your best."" His legacy is towering. Walter Payton—the man they called Sweetness, for the way he ran—remains the most prolific running back in the history of the National Football League, the star of the Chicago Bears' only Super Bowl Championship, eleven times voted the most popular sports figure in Chicago's history. Off the field, he was a devoted father whose charitable foundation benefited tens of thousands of children each year, and who—faced with terminal liver disease—refused to use his celebrity to gain a preferential position for organ donation. Walter Payton was not just a football hero; he was America's hero.        Never Die Easy is Walter Payton's autobiography, told from the heart. Growing up poor in Mississippi, he took up football to get girls' attention, and went on to become a Black College All-American at tiny Jackson State (during which time he was also a finalist in a Soul Train dance contest). Drafted by the Bears in 1975, he predicted that he would last only five years but went on to play thirteen extraordinary seasons, a career earning him regular acknowledgment as one of the greatest players in the history of professional football. And when his playing days were over, he approached business and charity endeavors with the same determination and success he had brought to the football field, always putting first his devotion to friends and family. His ultimate battle with illness truly proved him the champion he always had been and prompted a staggering outpouring of love and support from hundreds of thousands of friends and admirers.        Written with veteran journalist and author Don Yaeger in the last weeks of Walter Payton's life, Never Die Easy presents Walter's singular voice—warm, plainspoken, funny, self-aware—along with the voices of the friends, family, teammates, and business associates who knew him best at all stages of his life, including his wife, Connie, and their children, Brittney and Jarrett; his teammate and friend Matt Suhey; former Bears head coach Mike Ditka; and many, many others.          Walter made Don Yaeger promise that his book would be ""inspirational and leave people with some kind of lesson . . . and make sure you spell all the words right.""

Set in the 1730s in a Scotland uneasily united with England, the novel dramatizes different kinds of justice: that meted out by the Edinburgh mob in the lynching of one Captain Porteous, and that encountered by a young girl on trial for infanticide.A bestseller from Philadelphia to St. Petersburg, an inspiration to succeeding novelists from Balzac to George Eliot, The Heart of Mid-Lothian is the seventh and finest of Scott’s ‘Waverley’ novels.

Born in a rural village in 1940, Wangari Maathai was already an iconoclast as a child, determined to get an education even though most girls were uneducated. We see her studying with Catholic missionaries, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the United States, and becoming the first woman both to earn a PhD in East and Central Africa and to head a university department in Kenya. We witness her numerous run-ins with the brutal Moi government. She makes clear the political and personal reasons that compelled her, in 1977, to establish the Green Belt Movement, which spread from Kenya across Africa and which helps restore indigenous forests while assisting rural women by paying them to plant trees in their villages. We see how Maathai’s extraordinary courage and determination helped transform Kenya’s government into the democracy in which she now serves as assistant minister for the environment and as a member of Parliament. And we are with her as she accepts the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in recognition of her “contribution to sustainable development, human rights, and peace.” In Unbowed, Wangari Maathai offers an inspiring message of hope and prosperity through self-sufficiency.",,,,October 3rd 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Africa', 'Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Kenya', 'Biography', 'Feminism', 'Environment', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History']",,9780307263483,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320461066l/201111.jpg,4.1,['Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction (2007)'],181.0,2.0,,201111.Unbowed,,,,,95.0,4112.0,314,,Alfred A.

Warren Ellis,Crooked Little Vein,,English,,"Burned-out private detective and self-styled shit magnet Michael McGill needed a wake-up call to jump-start his dead career. What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this ""Secret Constitution"" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the ""good old days."" Like Vonnegut, Orwell, and Huxley before him, Warren Ellis deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the ""moral majority"" by giving us a glimpse at the monstrous outcome that their overzealous policies would achieve.",,,10/30/07,July 24th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Humor', 'Crime', 'Noir', 'Thriller', 'Detective', 'Comedy', 'Novels', 'Contemporary']",,9780060723934,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402408304l/43717.jpg,3.82,[],112.0,2.0,,43717.Crooked_Little_Vein,,,,,91.0,9137.0,288,,William Morrow,"['2539', '3471', '2282', '644', '201']",,,[],,

Warsan Shire (Goodreads Author),Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth,,English,,"What elevates 'teaching my mother how to give birth', what gives the poems their disturbing brilliance, is Warsan Shire's ability to give simple, beautiful eloquence to the veiled world where sensuality lives in the dominant narrative of Islam; reclaiming the more nuanced truths of earlier times - as in Tayeb Salih's work - and translating to the realm of lyric the work of the likes of Nawal El Saadawi. As Rumi said, ""Love will find its way through all languages on its own"". In 'teaching my mother how to give birth', Warsan's debut pamphlet, we witness the unearthing of a poet who finds her way through all preconceptions to strike the heart directly.

Wassily Kandinsky,Concerning the Spiritual in Art,,English,,"A pioneering work in the movement to free art from its traditional bonds to material reality, this book is one of the most important documents in the history of modern art. Written by the famous nonobjective painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944), it explains Kandinsky's own theory of painting and crystallizes the ideas that were influencing many other modern artists of the period. Along with his own groundbreaking paintings, this book had a tremendous impact on the development of modern art.Kandinsky's ideas are presented in two parts. The first part, called ""About General Aesthetic,"" issues a call for a spiritual revolution in painting that will let artists express their own inner lives in abstract, non-material terms. Just as musicians do not depend upon the material world for their music, so artists should not have to depend upon the material world for their art. In the second part, ""About Painting,"" Kandinsky discusses the psychology of colors, the language of form and color, and the responsibilities of the artist. An Introduction by the translator, Michael T. H. Sadler, offers additional explanation of Kandinsky's art and theories, while a new Preface by Richard Stratton discusses Kandinsky's career as a whole and the impact of the book. Making the book even more valuable are nine woodcuts by Kandinsky himself that appear at the chapter headings.This English translation of Über das Geistige in der Kunst was a significant contribution to the understanding of nonobjectivism in art. It continues to be a stimulating and necessary reading experience for every artist, art student, and art patron concerned with the direction of 20th-century painting.",,,10/30/12,June 1st 1977,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Art History', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Essays', 'Classics', 'Art Design', 'Theory']",,9780486234113,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405982387l/857502.jpg,3.82,[],174.0,2.0,,857502.Concerning_the_Spiritual_in_Art,,,,,85.0,76684.0,80,,Dover Publications,"['30296', '18928', '15876', '6398', '5186']",,,[],,
"Wassily Kandinsky, Hilla Rebay (Designed by)",Point and Line to Plane,,English,,"""I had the impression that here painting itself comes to the foreground; I wondered if it would not be possible to go further in this direction.""Thus did the young Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) react to his first viewing of Monet's Haystack, included in an 1895 Moscow exhibit of French Impressionists. It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist's inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane, one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the ""proto-element"" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art. As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",,,01/05/26,September 1st 1979,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Design', 'Art History', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Russia', 'Architecture', 'Art Design']",,9780486238081,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408469531l/352807.jpg,3.93,[],75.0,1.0,,352807.Point_and_Line_to_Plane,,,,,92.0,1053.0,192,,Dover Publications,"['347', '386', '234', '67', '19']",,,[],,

Manderlee, the last honey bee.Learn about Manderlee, an adventurous honey bee, and the challenges she must overcome in this beautifully illustrated rhyming story for ages 3+.When her hive is destroyed, Manderlee must find a new home. Learn about the importance of honey bees, and join Manderlee on her perilous journey to a foreign land. Will the last honey bee survive?The Last Honey Bee was a finalist in The Wishing Shelf Book Awards 2019.Reviewed by Michelle Stanley for Readers' Favorite - 5 StarsThe Last Honey Bee is a children’s picture book from Wayne Gerard Trotman’s Rhyming Stories series. Manderlee is a very sad honey bee. Humans destroyed the thriving bee colony she lived in with fire and poison. The queen bee, drones, and worker bees perished, but Manderlee survived. She had to travel far to seek a new colony and was almost made into honey bee cake by Kala Kaghee, an angry seagull. As she searches for a new hive to live in, Manderlee explains the importance of bees and why humans shouldn’t tear their wings or harm them. They produce tasty honey and pollinate the plants so our favorite fruits like pears, mangoes and strawberries can grow. Manderlee’s wings are very tired from flying too long. She’s also lonely, hungry and misses her honey-making job. Will she ever find a new colony of bees to start a new life and make friends?Manderlee is such an adorable bee. I felt her sorrow at losing her entire colony. The Last Honey Bee is a superb children’s book containing beautiful illustrations to match the adventure. Manderlee expresses her fears and concerns about colonies and offers advice to humans. It’s written in a moderately paced rhyming sequence that’s rather moving. The story is educational and is a great way for children to learn about nature and its importance to everyone. You will also meet other lovable characters such as Paddy McFly, and Romeo Cassanova.

It really is a sweeping, old style space opera in form, but with a depth of detail and personality development beyond anything I have read in a long time… The evolving personal interactions, not always positive, between friends, mentors and ambiguous allies old and new all serve to ground the narrative convincingly.

Wayne Grudem,Politics - According to the Bible: A Comprehensive Resource for Understanding Modern Political Issues in Light of Scripture,,English,,"A variety of perspectives exist within the Christian community when it comes to political issues and political involvement. This comprehensive and readable book presents a political philosophy from the perspective that the Gospel pertains to all of life so Christians should be involved in political issues. In brief, this is an analysis of conservative and liberal plans to do good for the nation, evaluated in light of the Bible and common sense.In this ground-breaking book, recognized evangelical Bible professor Wayne Grudem rejects five mistaken views about Christian influence on politics: (1) “compel religion,” (2) “exclude religion,” (3) “all government is demonic,” (4) “do evangel-ism, not politics,” and (5) “do politics, not evangelism.” He proposes a better alternative: (6) “significant Christian influence on government.” Then he explains the Bible’s teachings about the purpose of civil government and the characteristics of good or bad government. Does the Bible support some form of democracy? Should judges and the courts hold the ultimate power in a nation? With respect to specific political issues, Grudem argues that most people’s political views depend on deep-seated assumptions about several basic moral and even theological questions, such as whether God exists, whether absolute moral standards can be known, whether there is good and evil in each person’s heart, whether people should be accountable for their good and bad choices, whether property should belong to individuals or to society, and whether the purpose of the earth’s resources is to bring benefit to mankind. After addressing these foundational questions, Grudem provides a thoughtful, carefully-reasoned analysis of over fifty specific issues dealing with the protection of life, marriage, the family and children, economic issues and taxation, the environment, national defense, relationships to other nations, freedom of speech and religion, quotas, and special interests. He makes frequent application to the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, but the principles discussed here are relevant for any nation.",,,09/03/10,September 8th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'Religion', 'Reference', 'Political Science', 'Philosophy']",,9780310330295,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347313034l/8982042.jpg,3.87,[],100.0,1.0,,8982042-politics---according-to-the-bible,,,,,87.0,433.0,624,,Zondervan Academic,"['158', '138', '79', '37', '21']",,,[],,

Wayne Johnson (Goodreads Author),The Devil You Know,,English,,"When Max Geist plans a rugged canoe trip on the rivers of Northern Minnesota, fifteen-year-old David fears that dealing with his father--an opinionated, stubborn, novice outdoorsman--will be the roughest part of their journey. Little does he know that once he enters the unforgiving wilderness his life, and that of his family, will be irrevocably changed.At the start of their trip, David's father and younger sister, Janie, briefly cross paths with a group of men who, unbeknownst to the Geist family, are on the lam. Fearing the family may have learned too much about them, the outlaws decide to track down the unknown man and his daughter and, if need be, silence them. When they find the family's campsite, David is away; he returns to find his father in a life-or-death struggle with one man and his sister being savagely attacked by another. David, extraordinarily strong for his age, saves Max and Janie's lives and, in the process, kills a man. But the second man escapes, and David knows he has a partner . . . and that it is only a matter of time before they come back to finish the job they started. The outlaws become the only predators to fear in the wild as the Geist family is hunted down like animals--and uninjured David is the family's only hope for survival. As they tread through the snow-covered rocky terrain in search of safety, what began as a family bonding trip becomes a test of David's mental and physical limits, a journey into manhood and the responsibilities that come with it.The Devil You Know combines the breathtaking intensity of a first-rate literary thriller with the complexity and poignancy of a classic coming-of-age novel.

A subway passenger’s leather bracelet prompts musings on the German word for stranger; Montaigne leads to the memory of a fourth-grade friend’s stinky feet. Koestenbaum dreams about a hand job from John Ashbery, swims next to Nicole Kidman, reclaims Robert Rauschenberg’s squeegee, and apotheosizes Marguerite Duras as a destroyer of sentences. He directly proposes assignments to readers: “Buy a one-dollar cactus, and start anthropomorphizing it. Call it Sabrina.” “Describe an ungenerous or unkind act you have committed.” “Find in every orgasm an encyclopedic richness . . . Reimagine doing the laundry as having an orgasm, and reinterpret orgasm as not a tiny experience, temporally limited, occurring in a single human body, but as an experience that somehow touches on all of human history.” Figure It Out is both a guidebook for, and the embodiment of, the practices of pleasure, attentiveness, art, and play.",,,,May 5th 2020,[],Paperback,"['Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'American', 'Criticism']",,9781593765958,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572618149l/48658183.jpg,3.6,[],99.0,1.0,,48658183-figure-it-out,,,,,79.0,96.0,288,,Soft Skull,"['31', '23', '22', '13', '7']",,,[],,

Wayne W. Dyer,The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-create Your World Your Way,,English,,"Intention is generally viewed as a pit-bull kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this book. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This book explores intention—not as something you do—but as an energy you’re a part of. We’re all intended here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first book to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention. Part I deals with the principles of intention, offering true stories and examples on ways to make the connection. Dr. Dyer identifies the attributes of the all-creating universal mind of intention as creative, kind, loving, beautiful, expanding, endlessly abundant, and receptive, explaining the importance of emulating this source of creativity. In Part II, Dr. Dyer offers an intention guide with specific ways to apply the co-creating principles in daily life. Part III is an exhilarating description of Dr. Dyer’s vision of a world in harmony with the universal mind of intention. ",,,02/01/04,December 15th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Inspirational', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'New Age', 'Audiobook']",,9781401902162,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347598399l/19793.jpg,4.19,[],262.0,3.0,,19793.The_Power_of_Intention,,,,,94.0,28132.0,272,,Hay House,"['13510', '8638', '4373', '1023', '588']",,,[],,

Wayne W. Dyer,Inspiration: Your Ultimate Calling,,English,,"    There’s a voice in the universe calling each of us to remember our purpose—our reason for being here now, in this world of impermanence. The voice whispers, shouts, and sings to us that this experience of being in form, in space and time, knowing life and death, has meaning. The voice is that of inspiration, which is within each and every one of us.     In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains how we’ve chosen to enter this world of particles and form. From our place of origin, in ways that we don’t readily comprehend now, we knew what we were coming here to accomplish, and we participated in setting this life process in motion. So why not think this same way? Why put the responsibility or blame on any one or any thing that’s not a part of us? On Earth we have the capacity of volition—we can choose—so let’s assume that we had the same capacity when we resided in the spiritual realm. We chose our physical body, and we chose the parents we needed for the trip. It doesn’t seem too great a stretch to move into the idea that we chose this life in concert with our Source.     Each chapter in this book is filled with specifics for living an inspired life.

This scale is a measurement of your thoughts. To restore the same balance that characterizes everything in our universe, you have to take up the weighty thoughts so that they match up to your desires.The seasons reflect the overall harmony of life. For example, winter passes and the blossoms emerge. This is balanced by a need to have the trees rest, so autumn arrives on time and helps the trees ready themselves for another period of repose.

Wayne W. Dyer,Change Your Thoughts - Change Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the Tao,,English,,"Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses, which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of our existence. The classic text of these 81 verses, called the Tao Te Ching or the Great Way, offers advice and guidance that is balanced, moral, spiritual, and always concerned with working for the good.In this book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has reviewed hundreds of translations of the Tao Te Ching and has written 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today’s modern world. This work contains the entire 81 verses of the Tao, compiled from Wayne’s researching of 12 of the most well-respected translations of text that have survived for more than 25 centuries. Each chapter is designed for actually living the Tao or the Great Way today. Some of the chapter titles are “Living with Flexibility,” “Living Without Enemies,” and “Living by Letting Go.” Each of the 81 brief chapters focuses on living the Tao and concludes with a section called “Doing the Tao Now.”        Wayne spent one entire year reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu’s messages, practicing them each day and ultimately writing down these essays as he felt Lao-tzu wanted you to know them.This is a work to be read slowly, one essay a day. As Wayne says, “This is a book that will forever change the way you look at your life, and the result will be that you’ll live in a new world aligned with nature. Writing this book changed me forever, too. I now live in accord with the natural world and feel the greatest sense of peace I’ve ever experienced. I’m so proud to present this interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, and offer the same opportunity for change that it has brought me.”",,,10/28/07,July 31st 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Inspirational', 'Taoism', 'Religion', 'New Age']",,9781401911843,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328770256l/389763.jpg,4.24,[],366.0,4.0,,389763.Change_Your_Thoughts_Change_Your_Life,,,,,94.0,17522.0,392,,Hay House,"['8921', '5207', '2415', '602', '377']",,,[],,

Dyer reveals how to change the self-defeating thinking patterns that have prevented you from living at the highest levels of success, happiness, and health. Even though you may know what to think, actually changing those thinking habits that have been with you since childhood might be somewhat challenging.""If I changed, it would create family dramas . . . I’m too old or too young . . . I’m far too busy and tired . . . I can’t afford the things I truly want . . . It would be very difficult for me to do things differently . . . and I’ve always been this way . . ."" may all seem to be true, but they’re in fact just excuses. So the business of modifying habituated thinking patterns really comes down to tossing out the same tired old excuses and examining your beliefs in a new and truthful light.In this groundbreaking work, Wayne presents a compendium of conscious and subconscious crutches employed by virtually everyone, along with ways to cast them aside once and for all. You’ll learn to apply specific questions to any excuse, and then proceed through the steps of a new paradigm. The old, habituated ways of thinking will melt away as you experience the absurdity of hanging on to them.You’ll ultimately realize that there are no excuses worth defending, ever, even if they’ve always been part of your life—and the joy of releasing them will resonate throughout your very being.

Wayne W. Dyer,The Shift: Taking Your Life from Ambition to Meaning,,English,,"The Shift—a companion book to the movie of the same name—illustrates how and why to make the move from ambition to meaning. Such a shift eliminates our feelings of separateness, illuminates our spiritual connectedness, and involves moving from the ego-directed morning into the afternoon of life where everything is primarily influenced by purpose.As we contemplate leaving the morning of our life, where ego has played a commanding role, and entering the afternoon (and evening), where meaning and purpose replace ambition and struggle, we may encounter unexpected occurrences that accompany this new direction. It’s almost a universal law that we’ll experience a fall of some kind. Yet these falls or low points provide the energy we need to move away from ego and into a life of meaning and purpose.The Shift doesn’t mean that we lose our drive and ambition; it signifies that we become ambitious about something new. We make a commitment to living a life based on experiencing meaning and feeling purposeful, rather than never-ending demands and false promises that are the trademark of the ego’s agenda.As Dr. Wayne W. Dyer so eloquently reveals in these pages, we all have the choice to shift our lives from ambition to meaning . . . and thereby complete our return to the Source that created us.",,,10/30/09,March 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Inspirational', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook']",,9781401927097,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328768967l/7619178.jpg,4.2,[],98.0,1.0,,7619178-the-shift,,,,,93.0,1690.0,144,,Hay House,"['825', '514', '241', '80', '30']",,,[],,

Wendell Berry,The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture,,English,,"Since its publication by Sierra Club Books in 1977, The Unsettling of America has been recognized as a classic of American letters. In it, Wendell Berry argues that good farming is a cultural development and spiritual discipline. Today’s agribusiness, however, takes farming out of its cultural context and away from families. As a result, we as a nation are more estranged from the land—from the intimate knowledge, love, and care of it. Sadly, as Berry notes in his Afterword to this third edition, his arguments and observations are more relevant than ever. We continue to suffer loss of community, the devaluation of human work, and the destruction of nature under an economic system dedicated to the mechanistic pursuit of products and profits. Although “this book has not had the happy fate of being proved wrong,” Berry writes, there are good people working “to make something comely and enduring of our life on this earth.” Wendell Berry is one of those people, writing and working, as ever, with passion, eloquence, and conviction.",,,11/06/77,November 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Agriculture', 'Environment', 'Nature', 'History', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Ecology', 'Sustainability']",,9780871568779,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1363657372l/146191.jpg,4.38,[],80.0,1.0,,146191.The_Unsettling_of_America,,,,,97.0,3816.0,246,,Counterpoint,"['2083', '1232', '384', '84', '33']",,,[],,

"Wendell Berry, Michael Pollan (Goodreads Author) (Introduction)",Bringing it to the Table: On Farming and Food,,English,,"
  Only a farmer could delve so deeply into the origins of food, and only a writer of Wendell Berry’s caliber could convey it with such conviction and eloquence. Long before Whole Foods organic produce was available at your local supermarket, Berry was farming with the purity of food in mind. For the last five decades, Berry has embodied mindful eating through his land practices and his writing. In recognition of that influence, Michael Pollan here offers an introduction to this wonderful collection.Drawn from over thirty years of work, this collection joins bestsellers The Omnivore’s Dilemma, by Pollan, and Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, by Barbara Kingsolver, as essential reading for anyone who cares about what they eat. The essays address such concerns as: How does organic measure up against locally grown? What are the differences between small and large farms, and how does that affect what you put on your dinner table? What can you do to support sustainable agriculture?A progenitor of the Slow Food movement, Wendell Berry reminds us all to take the time to understand the basics of what we ingest. “Eating is an agriculture act,” he writes. Indeed, we are all players in the food economy.

Wendell Steavenson,Stories I Stole,,English,,"Fed up with working for Time magazine in London, Steavenson moved to Georgia on a whim. Stories I Stole relates her time there in twenty vodka-fuelled episodes drawn from all over the country – tales of love, friendship and power cuts, of duelling (Georgian style), of horse races in the mountains, wars and refugees, broken hearts, fixed elections, drinking sessions and a room containing a thousand roses.Stories I Stole is a wonderful example of a writer tackling an unconventional subject with such wit, humanity and sheer literary verve that one is unable to imagine why one never learnt more about Georgia before. Stories I Stole is a magnificent first book: erudite, engaged, candid and blissfully poetic. PROLOGUE: The author visits a bizarre “Stalin theme park” culminating in the eery viewing of Stalin’s death maskSHASHLIK, TAMADA, SUPRAThe author visits Khaketi, where she is introduced to the tamada culture of “exaggerated hospitality; a point-of-honour hospitality.” During a marathon toasting session at dinner she realizes “It is a kind of aggression. When they did not know you well, they filled your glass and filled it again and carefully watched how you drank it… This was the Georgian way, friend or enemy with nothing in between. History was lost in tradition, drinking a way of remembering and forgetting at the same time.”SHUKIThe frustration of living with unpredictable power and water supplies during extremely cold winters; the heat and/or electricity is often turned off due to reasons ranging from sabotage, corruption, non-payment, theft, “black clan economics,” and incompetence. Nevertheless this leads to a particular happiness when the light does come on. The author discovers the heavenly comfort of public baths. “Times were difficult; people had very little money. A lot of men were unemployed and all the old good professional jobs, teachers, nurses, police, engineers, were state jobs and paid less than $50 a month… Half Tbilisi owed the other half money.”ETHNIC CLEANSINGThe author visits Abkhazia, where a refugee has asked her to find the apartment that war caused him to flee. She finds a woman living there who is a refugee herself—after her own house was burned down, she discovered the fully furnished house in Abkhazia shortly after it was vacated, and has been living there ever since, proudly tending the garden of the previous occupant.WHO ARE THE ABKHAZOn the beach with Shalva, whom she suspects is “Abkhaz KGB.” He feeds her the party line about the Abkhaz occupation and she feels like screaming truths at him. “You won the war. You threw out all the Georgians. You have your homeland to yourselves (apart from the Armenian villages and the pockets of Russians) and what is this place? It’s a black hole. There are barely any cars, barely any petrol, no factories, nothing works, no private businesses, a curfew, no salaries, barely any pensions, a shell of a university, a terrible hospital, etc. etc.” But Shalva doubts that the West is paradise: “Here we have everything we need. The land is fertile.”THE DUELThe story of Dato and Aleko—they get into a car wreck and Dato’s face is horribly scarred. Aleko steals Dato’s wife and Dato challenges him to a fight. When Aleko beats Dato up, Dato pulls a gun and shoots the man until he is almost paralyzed. Dato, meanwhile, lives the rest of his life with his mother, hooked on heroin. “Not really Pushkin is it?”LARGE ABANDONED OBJECTSThe author drives to Abkhazia with several journalists to see incumbent Ardzinba win the presidential election (the journalists rename it the “presidential farce,” since Ardzinba is the only one running. The author marvels over the abandoned relics of the USSR she sees along the roadside—rusting tractors, bits of pipline, lines of coal cars shunted and left along a rail line, etc. For her birthday, the author goes to Gorbachev’s dacha, a palatial house he built but never got to inhabit because of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The house is a metaphor for the USSR: “impressive only for its sheer size but actually full of empty space and tat.”",,,07/09/02,February 24th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Short Stories', 'Russia']",,9780802140678,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328822253l/1727888.jpg,3.83,['Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2002)'],86.0,1.0,,1727888.Stories_I_Stole,,,,,94.0,230.0,288,,Grove Press,"['57', '94', '65', '10', '4']",,,['Georgia (Eurasian country)'],,

Wendy Brown,Politics Out of History,,English,,"What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective? Politics Out of History is animated by the question of how we navigate the contemporary political landscape when the traditional compass points of modernity have all but disappeared. Wendy Brown diagnoses a range of contemporary political tendencies--from moralistic high-handedness to low-lying political despair in politics, from the difficulty of formulating political alternatives to reproaches against theory in intellectual life--as the consequence of this disorientation.Politics Out of History also presents a provocative argument for a new approach to thinking about history--one that forsakes the idea that history has a purpose and treats it instead as a way of illuminating openings in the present by, for example, identifying the haunting and constraining effects of past injustices unresolved. Brown also argues for a revitalized relationship between intellectual and political life, one that cultivates the autonomy of each while promoting their interlocutory potential. This book will be essential reading for all who find the trajectories of contemporary liberal democracies bewildering and are willing to engage readings of a range of thinkers--Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin, Derrida--to rethink democratic possibility in our time.",,,08/06/01,August 26th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Theory', 'History', 'Politics', 'Philosophy']",,9780691070858,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347431373l/311909.jpg,4.13,[],97.0,1.0,,311909.Politics_Out_of_History,,,,,100.0,55.0,193,,Princeton University Press,"['16', '30', '9', '0', '0']",,,[],,
Wendy Brown,Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire,,English,,"Tolerance is generally regarded as an unqualified achievement of the modern West. Emerging in early modern Europe to defuse violent religious conflict and reduce persecution, tolerance today is hailed as a key to decreasing conflict across a wide range of other dividing lines-- cultural, racial, ethnic, and sexual. But, as political theorist Wendy Brown argues in Regulating Aversion, tolerance also has dark and troubling undercurrents. Dislike, disapproval, and regulation lurk at the heart of tolerance. To tolerate is not to affirm but to conditionally allow what is unwanted or deviant. And, although presented as an alternative to violence, tolerance can play a part in justifying violence--dramatically so in the war in Iraq and the War on Terror. Wielded, especially since 9/11, as a way of distinguishing a civilized West from a barbaric Islam, tolerance is paradoxically underwriting Western imperialism. Brown's analysis of the history and contemporary life of tolerance reveals it in a startlingly unfamiliar guise. Heavy with norms and consolidating the dominance of the powerful, tolerance sustains the abjection of the tolerated and equates the intolerant with the barbaric. Examining the operation of tolerance in contexts as different as the War on Terror, campaigns for gay rights, and the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance, Brown traces the operation of tolerance in contemporary struggles over identity, citizenship, and civilization.",,,07/31/06,August 20th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Academic', 'Race', 'Queer', 'History', 'Social Justice', 'Feminism']",,9780691126548,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435782356l/311908._SY475_.jpg,4.23,[],99.0,1.0,,311908.Regulating_Aversion,,,,,97.0,197.0,268,,Princeton University Press,"['81', '87', '23', '6', '0']",,,[],,

Wendy J. Glenn,Sarah Dessen: From Burritos to Box Office,,English,,"Dessen's body of fiction appeals to readers on many levels. Her writing style is complex yet readable, rich in meaning yet accessible. Adult readers find themselves drawn to her works for their passages of grace and good humor. They are reminded of the joys and frustrations they experienced during adolescence, those years that seemed to last an eternity at the time but now seem to have passed when they weren't looking. With her wit and insight, Dessen takes older readers back. With her honesty and sensitivity, she moves adolescent readers forward. Dessen's novels offer not only high-quality writing, but also characters who experience life as young people do, featuring teens working to figure out who they are, upon whom they can depend, and how to assert their place in an increasingly complex world. Dessen speaks to her readers, taking on weighty issues with skill and intention, refusing to talk down to the young people who find themselves both lost and found in the fictional worlds she creates. She knows how to balance the heavy with the light, weaving humor and quirkiness into stories that deal with themes weighty with emotional baggage. Each of the six young adult novels Dessen has published has received critical acclaim within the world of adolescent literature, as evidenced by successful reviews and accolades in the form of literary awards. Several key patterns emerge in the discussion and evaluation of Dessen's novels. In her fiction, she explores the complexity of human relationships between and among characters, undermines gender expectations, develops the themes of self-perception and identity, creates eccentric and memorable secondary characters, and uses humor to help readers bear the angst of teenage life. Because Dessen's body of fiction contains just six titles, this work explores deeply each of her novels, tracing the existence of the above-noted patterns while seeking the distinctive flavor that sets each work apart from the others.",,,02/28/04,October 15th 2004,[],Hardcover,['Biography'],,9780810853256,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389481608l/227499.jpg,4.02,[],54.0,1.0,,227499.Sarah_Dessen,,,,,90.0,52.0,168,,Scarecrow Press,"['26', '8', '13', '3', '2']",,,[],,

Wendy Mogel,The Blessing Of A Skinned Knee: Raising Self-Reliant Children,,English,,"The beloved bestseller that offers a practical, inspiring new roadmap for raising self-reliant, ethical, and compassionate children.In the trenches of a typical day, every parent encounters a child afflicted with ingratitude and entitlement. In a world where material abundance abounds, parents want so badly to raise self-disciplined, appreciative, and resourceful children who are not spoiled by the plentitude around them. But how to accomplish this feat? The answer has eluded the best-intentioned mothers and fathers who overprotect, overindulge, and overschedule their children's lives. Dr. Mogel helps parents learn how to turn their children's worst traits into their greatest attributes. Starting with stories of everyday parenting problems and examining them through the lens of the Torah, the Talmud, and important Jewish teachings, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee shows parents how to teach children to honor their parents and to respect others, escape the danger of overvaluing children's need for self-expression so that their kids don't become ""little attorneys,"" accept that their children are both ordinary and unique, and treasure the power and holiness of the present moment. It is Mogel's singular achievement that she makes these teachings relevant for any era and any household of any faith. A unique parenting book, designed for use both in the home and in parenting classes, with an on-line teaching guide to help facilitate its use, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee is both inspiring and effective in the day-to-day challenge of raising self-reliant children.",,,01/04/01,December 2nd 2008,[],Paperback,"['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Judaism', 'Education', 'Jewish', 'Family', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Judaica']",,9781416593065,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442269863l/3059244._SY475_.jpg,4.17,[],97.0,1.0,,3059244-the-blessing-of-a-skinned-knee,,,,,96.0,3721.0,304,,Scribner,"['1536', '1458', '595', '102', '30']",,,[],,

Wendy Pearlman,We Crossed a Bridge and It Trembled: Voices from Syria,,,,"LONG-LISTED FOR THE CARNEGIE MEDALReminiscent of the work of Nobel Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich, an astonishing collection of intimate wartime testimonies and poetic fragments from a cross-section of Syrians whose lives have been transformed by revolution, war, and flight.Against the backdrop of the wave of demonstrations known as the Arab Spring, in 2011 hundreds of thousands of Syrians took to the streets demanding freedom, democracy and human rights. The government’s ferocious response, and the refusal of the demonstrators to back down, sparked a brutal civil war that over the past five years has escalated into the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our times.Yet despite all the reporting, the video, and the wrenching photography, the stories of ordinary Syrians remain unheard, while the stories told about them have been distorted by broad brush dread and political expediency. This fierce and poignant collection changes that. Based on interviews with hundreds of displaced Syrians conducted over four years across the Middle East and Europe, We Crossed a Bridge and It Trembled is a breathtaking mosaic of first-hand testimonials from the frontlines. Some of the testimonies are several pages long, eloquent narratives that could stand alone as short stories; others are only a few sentences, poetic and aphoristic.

Wendy Shalit,Girls Gone Mild: Young Women Reclaim Self-Respect and Find It's Not Bad to Be Good,,English,,"At twenty-three, Wendy Shalit punctured conventional wisdom with A Return to Modesty, arguing that our hope for true lasting love is not a problem to be fixed but rather a wonderful instinct that forms the basis for civilization. Now, in Girls Gone Mild, the brilliantly outspoken author investigates an emerging new movement. Despite nearly-naked teen models posing seductively to sell us practically everything, and the proliferation of homemade sex tapes as star-making vehicles, a youth-led rebellion is already changing course.In Seattle and Pittsburgh, teenage girls protest against companies that sell sleazy clothing. Online, a nineteen-year-old describes her struggles with her mother, who she feels is pressuring her to lose her virginity. In a small town outside Philadelphia, an eleventh-grade girl, upset over a “dirty book” read aloud in English class, takes her case to the school board. These are not your mother’s rebels.In an age where pornography is mainstream, teen clothing seems stripper-patented, and “experts” recommend that we learn to be emotionally detached about sex, a key (and callously) targeted audience–girls–is fed up. Drawing on numerous studies and interviews, Shalit makes the case that today’s virulent “bad girl” mindset most truly oppresses young women. Nowadays, as even the youngest teenage girls feel the pressure to become cold sex sirens, put their bodies on public display, and suppress their feelings in order to feel accepted and (temporarily) loved, many young women are realizing that “friends with benefits” are often anything but. And as these girls speak for themselves, we see that what is expected of them turns out to be very different from what is in their own hearts.Shalit reveals how the media, one’s peers, and even parents can undermine girls’ quests for their authentic selves, details the problems of sex without intimacy, and explains what it means to break from the herd mentality and choose integrity over popularity. Written with sincerity and upbeat humor, Girls Gone Mild rescues the good girl from the realm of mythology and old manners guides to show that today’s version is the real rebel: She is not “people pleasing” or repressed; she is simply reclaiming her individuality. These empowering stories are sure to be an inspiration to teenagers and parents alike.",,,11/05/07,June 26th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Parenting', 'Sociology', 'Womens', 'Feminism', 'Sexuality', 'Psychology', 'Christian', 'Cultural', 'Womens Studies']",,9781400064731,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320446663l/282552.jpg,3.62,[],77.0,1.0,,282552.Girls_Gone_Mild,,,,,82.0,285.0,336,,Random House,"['73', '100', '60', '34', '18']",,,[],,

"Wes Moore, Tavis Smiley (Afterword)","The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates",,English,,"Two kids with the same name lived in the same decaying city. One went on to be a Rhodes Scholar, decorated combat veteran, White House Fellow, and business leader. The other is serving a life sentence in prison. Here is the story of two boys and the journey of a generation. In December 2000, the Baltimore Sun ran a small piece about Wes Moore, a local student who had just received a Rhodes Scholarship. The same paper also ran a series of articles about four young men who had allegedly killed a police officer in a spectacularly botched armed robbery. The police were still hunting for two of the suspects who had gone on the lam, a pair of brothers. One was named Wes Moore.  Wes just couldn’t shake off the unsettling coincidence, or the inkling that the two shared much more than space in the same newspaper. After following the story of the robbery, the manhunt, and the trial to its conclusion, he wrote a letter to the other Wes, now a convicted murderer serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. His letter tentatively asked the questions that had been haunting him: Who are you? How did this happen?That letter led to a correspondence and relationship that have lasted for several years. Over dozens of letters and prison visits, Wes discovered that the other Wes had had a life not unlike his own: Both had grown up in similar neighborhoods and had had difficult childhoods, both were fatherless; they’d hung out on similar corners with similar crews, and both had run into trouble with the police. At each stage of their young lives they had come across similar moments of decision, yet their choices would lead them to astonishingly different destinies.Told in alternating dramatic narratives that take readers from heart-wrenching losses to moments of surprising redemption, The Other Wes Moore tells the story of a generation of boys trying to find their way in a hostile world.",,,,April 27th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'School', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'African American', 'Book Club', 'Race']",,9780385528191,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554118l/7099273.jpg,3.84,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir and Autobiography (2010)'],288.0,3.0,,7099273-the-other-wes-moore,,,,,93.0,36837.0,233,,Spiegel & Grau,"['9126', '15567', '9665', '1973', '506']",,,[],,

Western Sonoma County Historical Society,Sebastopol,,,History,"Since the 1850s, the soothing countryside hamlets of Sonoma County have beckoned settlers of every stripe-farmers, homesteaders, businesspeople, and commuters. Sebastopol has always been among the county's loveliest towns, retaining its small-town feel even as its population has steadily grown. This book of vintage photography presents Sebastopol's journey through time, the early Mexican land grants and initial settlements, Luther Burbank's far-ranging botanical experiments, and the rich farming industry that made this town one of California's premier agricultural zones, producing grapes, hops, cherries, and dairy products. In these pages readers will experience Sebastopol's turn-of-the-century days at the Apple Fair, with its astonishing fruit sculptures. The first days of railroads are illustrated with images of the Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railway, an electric train system that took passengers to and from Sebastopol Depot. The architecture of the region and the stories of local businesses and institutions are all shown here, along with Sebastopol's early religious institutions, schools, sawmills, factories, and even its small airport in the 1920s. Together with views of the town's sporting teams, natural history, outlying communities, and important citizens, these photographs tell a unique story of a unique place that transcends the generations.",,,,2003.0,,,,0738528528,9780738528526,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AV7207YoIMMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.4,,,,,,,,,,,,128.0,,,,4.0,,,,

Since its first publication in 1646 it has remained absolutely unsurpassed as an accurate and concise statement of Christian doctrine. Among all the shifting sands of theological opinion here is solid truth, for it has its foundation in the unchanging truth of Scripture--witness the copious references from the Bible which are printed on each page. Because of its faithfulness to Scripture the Confession has permanent worth and abiding relevance.The Church of Christ cannot be creedless and live. Especially in an age of doubt and confusion, it is her duty to define the Christian faith and to proclaim it to the world. Nowhere has the Reformed Church done this so effectively as in The Westminster Confession of Faith. While always recognising the supreme place of the Word of God in all matters of faith and practice, one can always turn to the Confession as one's subordinate standard. Here readers will find spiritual treasure; here too they will find comfort and strength.Also contained in this volume are the magnificent Larger and Shorter Catechisms, The Sum of Saving Knowledge, The National Covenant, The Solemn League and Covenant, The Directory for the Public Worship of God, The Form of Presbyterial Church Government, and The Directory for Family Worship.",,,10/28/46,November 1983,[],Hardcover,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Reference', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Church History', 'Religion', 'School', 'History', 'Classics']",,9780902506084,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367225081l/6463822.jpg,4.51,[],283.0,3.0,,6463822-westminster-confession-of-faith-w-catechisms-1646-7,,,,,96.0,2072.0,438,,Free Presbyterian Publications,"['1401', '429', '160', '52', '30']",,,[],,

Instead of looking at people afflicted with disease symptoms, this highly-respected dentist and dental researcher chose to focus on healthy individuals, and challenged himself to understand how they achieved such amazing health. Dr. Price traveled to hundreds of cities in a total of 14 different countries in his search to find healthy people. He investigated some of the most remote areas in the world. He observed perfect dental arches, minimal tooth decay, high immunity to tuberculosis and overall excellent health in those groups of people who ate their indigenous foods. He found when these people were introduced to modernized foods, such as white flour, white sugar, refined vegetable oils and canned goods, signs of degeneration quickly became quite evident. Dental caries, deformed jaw structures, crooked teeth, arthritis and a low immunity to tuberculosis became rampant amongst them.

Wil S. Hylton,Vanished: The Sixty-Year Search for the Missing Men of World War II,,English,,"In the fall of 1944, a massive American bomber carrying eleven men vanished over the Pacific islands of Palau, leaving a trail of mysteries. According to mission reports from the Army Air Forces, the plane crashed in shallow water—but when investigators went to find it, the wreckage wasn't there. Witnesses saw the crew parachute to safety, yet the airmen were never seen again. Some of their relatives whispered that they had returned to the United States in secret and lived in hiding. But they never explained why.For sixty years, the U.S. government, the children of the missing airmen, and a maverick team of scientists and scuba divers searched the islands for clues. They trolled the water with side-scan sonar, conducted grid searches on the seafloor, crawled through thickets of mangrove and poison trees, and flew over the islands in small planes to shoot infrared photography. With every clue they found, the mystery only deepened.Now, in a spellbinding narrative, Wil S. Hylton weaves together the true story of the missing men, their final mission, the families they left behind, and the real reason their disappearance remained shrouded in secrecy for so long. This is a story of love, loss, sacrifice, and faith—of the undying hope among the families of the missing, and the relentless determination of scientists, explorers, archaeologists, and deep-sea divers to solve one of the enduring mysteries of World War II.",,,11/06/13,November 5th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'Military History', 'Adventure', 'Adult']",,9781594487279,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367785757l/17707499.jpg,3.93,[],91.0,1.0,,17707499-vanished,,,,,93.0,1941.0,288,,Riverhead Books,"['581', '801', '427', '99', '33']",,,[],,

The lion is Sean, hero of this tremendous drama of the men who took possession of South Africa in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.Sean and his twin-brother Garrick grew up on their father's farm in Natal. The first part of the book deals with his childhood and youth and his longing to become a successful farmer and hard-hitting fighter like his father.The tough life of cattle-farming is brusquely interrupted by the Zulu Wars, when Sean and his brother see fighting for the first time.

Sean and Duff are caught at last in a trap laid by their rival, the sinister and clever Hradsky, and leave Johannesburg for the wilderness to seek their fortunes once more.And now the book moves to its climax. At last it seems as though Sean will settle to a quiet married life – but fate has other plans for him. They return to Johannesburg and tragedy strikes quickly. Sean finds himself alone once more...Filled with action scenes in war and the early heady days of the gold rush, and adventure among the vast game herds of the African wilderness, this novel is dominated by the towering compelling personality of Sean, whose life story is continued in The Sound of Thunder and A Sparrow Falls.Reviews * 'Plenty of incident and colour' – The Observer, 1966 * 'Pride of place goes to When the Lion Feeds because it is bigger, wider and more full of plot than all the others put together ...' – The Daily Telegraph, 1966. * 'Wilbur Smith has built up his wide-screen adventure story with energy and shrewdness.' – Sunday Times, 1966 * 'Mr. Smith is a natural story-teller who moves confidently and often splendidly in his period and sustains a flow of convincing incident without repeating his excitement.' – The Scotsman. 1966 * 'A very impressive book in its wide scope and its descriptive colour.' – Sphere",Courtney #1,,10/28/64,October 3rd 2006,['Sean Courtney'],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'South Africa', 'Action', 'Novels', 'Audiobook']",,9780312940669,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388892414l/16951.jpg,4.19,[],671.0,7.0,,16951.When_the_Lion_Feeds,,,,,97.0,13496.0,544,,St. Martin's Paperbacks,"['5798', '5100', '2136', '351', '111']",,,['South Africa'],,

Dramatic and psychologically absorbing, the action of The Haunted Hotel (1878) takes place in an ancient Venetian palazzo converted into a modern hotel that houses a grisly secreI. Lastly, set in a beautiful water-mill, The Guilty River (1886) depicts a group of alienated characters, whose relationships threaten to erupt in violence and murder.

Will Durant,Our Oriental Heritage,,English,,"This is the classic reference on world history, recognized as the most comprehensive general history ever written, the result of four decades of work by Will and Ariel Durant -- a set that The New York Times called ""a splendid, broad panorama of hereditary culture in words and images that the layman can fully understand."" This series began as an effort to write a history on the nineteenth century, an undertaking that Will Durant realized could only be understood in terms of what had come before. So the Durants embarked on an encyclopedic survey of all civilization, ancient and modern, Occidental and Oriental. The books:
  
Our Oriental Heritage (Volume 1): Will Durant opens his massive survey of civilized history with a sweeping look at the Orient: the Egyptians, who perfected monumental architecture, medicine and mummification; the Babylonians, who developed astronomy and physics; the Judeans, who preserved their culture in the immortal books of the Old Testament; and the Persians, who ruled the largest empire in recorded history before Rome.The Life of Greece (Volume 2): Will Durant's survey of ancient Greece shows us the origins of democracy and the political legacy to the Western world; the golden age of Athens, its architecture, poetry, drama, sculpture and Olympic contests; the blossoming of philosophical thought amid a society still rooted in slavery and barbarism; and the mysterious lost island of Crete, land of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth.
  
Caesar and Christ (Volume 3): Spanning a millenium in Roman history, the third volume in the Durants' series shows us a world-conquering Roman army, undefeated, unafraid and...vegeterian; Hannibal, who transported an army of elephants over the Alps to invade Rome; Julius Caesar, who brought Western Europe under Roman rule; the life and Passion of Christ; and the struggle of the rising church.
  
The Age of Faith (Volume 4): Over 1,000 years, we meet the Christian ascetics and martyrs, including Simeon Stylites, who sat atop a pillar for 30 years, exposed to rain, sun, and snow, and rejoiced as worms ate his rotting flesh; the saints, including Augustine, the most influential philosopher of his age; Mohammed, the desert merchant who founded a religion that conquered one-third of the known world in two centuries; and the Italian poet Dante, whose sensibility marks the transition to the Renaissance.
  
The Renaissance (Volume 5): In this volume, Will Durant examines the economic seeds -- the growth of industry, the rise of banking families, the conflicts of labor and capital -- for Italy's emergence as the first nation to feel the awakening of the modern mind. He follows the cultural flowering from Florence to Milan to Verona and eventually to Rome, allowing us to witness a colorful pageant of princes, queens, poets, painters, sculptors and architects. We see humanity moved boldly from a finite world to an infinite one.
  
The Reformation (Volume 6): In Europe's tumultuous emergence from the Middle Ages, we encounter two rival popes fighting for control of a corrupt, cynical church; the Hundred Years' War and 13-year-old warrior Joan of Arc; Christopher Columbus' accidental discovery of the New World; and Martin Luther, who defied the pope and ultimately led Northern Europe into the age of individualism.
  
The Age of Reason Begins (Volume 7): In one of Europe's most turbulent centuries, Philip II of Spain sees his ""invincible"" armada suffer defeat at the hands of England; Elizabeth I of England receives assistance from explorer Walter Raleigh and pirate Francis Drake; and new appeals for reason and science are exemplified in the ideas of Copernicus, Galileo and Descartes.
  
The Age of Louis XIV (Volume 8): This installment is the biography of a period some consider the apex of modern European civilization. ""Some centuries hence,"" Frederick the Great predicted to Voltaire, ""they will translate the good authors of the time of Louis XIV as we translate those of the age of Pericles or Augustus."" Those authors are lovingly treated here: Pascal and Fenelon, Racine and Boileau, Mme. de Sevigne and Mme. de La Fayette, and, above all, the philosopher-dramatist Moliere, exposing the vices and hypocrisies of the age.
  
The Age of Voltaire (Volume 9): A biography of a great man and the period he embodied. We witness Voltaire's satiric work in the salons and the theater as well as his banishment to England. With him we view the complex relationships between nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and peasantry in the France of Louis XV. We explore the music of Bach and the struggle between Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa of Austria. And finally we hear an imaginary discussion between Voltaire and Pope Benedict XIV on the significance and value of religion.
  
Rousseau and Revolution (Volume 10): This volume ranges over a Europe in ferment, but centers on the passionate rebel-philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who contended with Voltaire for the mind of Europe. Rousseau condemned civilization as a disease, glorified the noble savage, proclaimed to the world with equal intensity his own love affairs and the natural rights of man, and became the patron saint of the French Revolution and social upheavals across the globe for two centuries.
  
The Age of Napoleon (Volume 11): The final volume. Napoleon is the archetypical hero, whose restless, ambitious, and intelligent mind dominated his age and has never ceased to fascinate the world he helped fashion. Yet even Bonaparte is dwarfed by the age that took his name. For, the Durants have re-created the life, the history, the arts, the science, the politics, the philosophy, the manners and the morality, the very spirit of the turbulent epoch that began with the French Revolution, ended with the fall of the emperor and ushered in the modern world.

Will Ferguson,"Bastards & Boneheads: Canada’s Glorious Leaders, Past and Present",,English,,"This is it! After years of research, often late into the night, best-selling author Will Ferguson has come up with the most sophisticated system ever devised for evaluating Canadian leadership. It’s called BASTARDS AND BONEHEADS.Bastards succeed. Whether their goals are noble or immoral, Bastards are ruthless. Active. They cause events to unfold by an act of focussed will. Boneheads fail, usually by stumbling over their own two feet. Boneheads are reactive. Inept. They cause events to unfold mainly by accident. Bastards screw Canada. Boneheads just screw up.BASTARDS AND BONEHEADS makes an excellent parlour game. Pierre Trudeau was a Bastard. Joe Clark was not. Brian Mulroney managed to be both. Your turn: Jean Chrétien—Bastard or Bonehead?But Ferguson doesn’t limit himself to the prime ministers. No, sir. He takes on the full sweep of Canadian history, examining and evaluating the key personalities behind our most momentous events. When the English captured Quebec in 1759, was it a “Battle of Boneheads” or a “Contest of Bastards”? Was the War of 1812 won by Bastards? Or lost by Boneheads? From the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War to Canada’s contribution to the Holocaust, from the battle for women’s rights to the rise of the separatist movement, Will Ferguson looks at our past head-on, wars and all.

With Great Apes, Self takes readers into a sort of ""Planet of the Apes"" with a twist. Simon Dykes is a London painter whose life suddenly becomes Kafkaesque. After an evening of routine debauchery, traipsing from toilet to toilet and partaking in a host of narcotics, the middle-aged painter wakes to discover that his girlfriend, Sarah, has turned into a chimpanzee. Simon is also a chimp, but he does not accept this fact—he is convinced that he is still human.He is then confined to an emergency psychiatric ward and placed under the care of alpha-psychiatrist Dr. Zack Busner. Simon finds chimp behavior a bit unnatural; he can't bring himself to use gestures rather than speech to communicate. He also finds it difficult to mate publicly or accept social grooming. Dr. Zack Busner—also a medical doctor, radical psychoanalyst, maverick axiolytic drug researcher, and former television personality—is prepared to help Simon get used to ""chimpunity"".

The story of a devilishly clever international financier/marketing wizard and his young apprentice, My Idea of Fun is both a frighteningly dark subterranean exploration of capitalism run rampant and a wickedly sharp, technically acute display of linguistic pyrotechnics that glows with pure white-hot brilliance. Ian Wharton is a very ordinary young man until he is taken under the wing of a gentleman known variously as Mr. Broadhurst, Samuel Northcliff, and finally and simply the Fat Controller. Loudmouthed, impeccably tailored, and a fount of bombastic erudition, the Fat Controller initiates Ian into the dark secrets of his arts -- of marketing, money, and the human psyche -- and takes Ian, and the reader, on a wild voyage around the edges of reality.

Willa Cather,Lucy Gayheart,,English,,"""Some people's lives are affected by what happens to their person or their property, but for others fate is what happens to their feelings and their thoughts—that and nothing more."" In this haunting 1935 novel, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of My Ántonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop performs a series of crystalline variations on the themes that preoccupy her greatest fiction: the impermanence of innocence, the opposition between prairie and city, provincial American values and world culture, and the grandeur, elation, and heartache that await a gifted young woman who leaves her small Nebraska town to pursue a life in art.At the age of eighteen, Lucy Gayheart heads for Chicago to study music. She is beautiful and impressionable and ardent, and these qualities attract the attention of Clement Sebastian, an aging but charismatic singer who exercises all the tragic, sinister fascination of a man who has renounced life only to turn back to seize it one last time. Out of their doomed love affair—and Lucy's fatal estrangement from her origins—Willa Cather creates a novel that is as achingly lovely as a Schubert sonata.",,,10/29/35,September 26th 1995,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']",,9780679728887,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381743559l/599782.jpg,3.93,[],100.0,1.0,,599782.Lucy_Gayheart,,,,,94.0,1569.0,208,,Vintage,"['471', '620', '389', '72', '17']",,,[],,
Willa Cather,Death Comes for the Archbishop,,English,,"Willa Cather's best known novel is an epic--almost mythic--story of a single human life lived simply in the silence of the southwestern desert. In 1851 Father Jean Marie Latour comes to serve as the Apostolic Vicar to New Mexico. What he finds is a vast territory of red hills and tortuous arroyos, American by law but Mexican and Indian in custom and belief. In the almost forty years that follow, Latour spreads his faith in the only way he knows--gently, all the while contending with an unforgiving landscape, derelict and sometimes openly rebellious priests, and his own loneliness.

But this worldly, sarcastic, and perhaps even wicked woman may have been made for something greater than love.In her portrait of Myra and in her exquisitely nuanced depiction of her marriage, Cather shows the evolution of a human spirit as it comes to bridle against the constraints of ordinary happiness and seek an otherworldly fulfillment.

Willa Cather,O Pioneers!,,English,,"O Pioneers! (1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier—and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, O Pioneers! is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.",Great Plains Trilogy #1,,10/28/13,1992,['Alexandra Bergson'],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Westerns', '20th Century', 'Classic Literature']",,9780679743620,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388956566l/140963.jpg,3.87,[],2921.0,45.0,,140963.O_Pioneers_,,,,,92.0,45610.0,159,,Vintage,"['13465', '17720', '10575', '2720', '1130']",,,['Nebraska (United States)'],,

William B. Irvine,A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,,English,,"One of the great fears many of us face is that despite all our effort and striving, we will discover at the end that we have wasted our life. In A Guide to the Good Life, William B. Irvine plumbs the wisdom of Stoic philosophy, one of the most popular and successful schools of thought in ancient Rome, and shows how its insight and advice are still remarkably applicable to modern lives. In A Guide to the Good Life, Irvine offers a refreshing presentation of Stoicism, showing how this ancient philosophy can still direct us toward a better life. Using the psychological insights and the practical techniques of the Stoics, Irvine offers a roadmap for anyone seeking to avoid the feelings of chronic dissatisfaction that plague so many of us. Irvine looks at various Stoic techniques for attaining tranquility and shows how to put these techniques to work in our own life. As he does so, he describes his own experiences practicing Stoicism and offers valuable first-hand advice for anyone wishing to live better by following in the footsteps of these ancient philosophers. Readers learn how to minimize worry, how to let go of the past and focus our efforts on the things we can control, and how to deal with insults, grief, old age, and the distracting temptations of fame and fortune. We learn from Marcus Aurelius the importance of prizing only things of true value, and from Epictetus we learn how to be more content with what we have. Finally, A Guide to the Good Life shows readers how to become thoughtful observers of their own life. If we watch ourselves as we go about our daily business and later reflect on what we saw, we can better identify the sources of distress and eventually avoid that pain in our life. By doing this, the Stoics thought, we can hope to attain a truly joyful life.",,,,November 1st 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Business', 'Health']",,9780195374612,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547348819l/5617966._SX318_.jpg,4.22,[],274.0,3.0,,5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life,,,,,97.0,14870.0,326,,Oxford University Press,"['6568', '5639', '2161', '402', '100']",,,[],,
"William Barton, Michael Capobianco (Goodreads Author)",Alpha Centauri,,English,,"The word in the year 2239 is that the human race is doomed. With the Earth groaning beneath the weight of 200 billion people and with the limit of derivable scientific knowledge frighteningly close at hand, scientists believe the human race will crash, burn and vanish by the end of the twenty-third century. The last hope of humanity travels with Captain Virginia Vonzell Qing-an, her androgynous lover, and eleven other crew members aboard Earth's first starship, Mother Night, on a colonizing mission to Alpha Centauri—the closest, most likely place to find worlds suitable for human habitation. It is the adventure of a lifetime, but plagued from the onset by programming errors, structural damage and irresponsible death. But a different kind of plague could doom the assignment and, ultimately, the civilization that conceived it. A terrorist group, Indigo, has infiltrated the ship—single-minded true believers convinced that the only cure for their world's population problems is rampant, viral-induced, sexually transmitted sterilization. And the stakes are about to reach astronomical proportions. Because an artifact exists on a rocky moon called Atalanta, an impossibly ancient remnant of an alien race that offers possible solutions to humanity's gravest dilemma—and a hope and knowledge beyond present mortal comprehension—but only if Mother Night's besieged mission can somehow, miraculously, be salvaged.",,,1997,September 1st 1998,[],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction']",,9780380782055,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1177023837l/675513.jpg,2.87,[],24.0,1.0,,675513.Alpha_Centauri,,,,,62.0,91.0,448,,Eos,"['9', '20', '27', '20', '15']",,,[],,

Nothing in Jake's life is the same after Vanni, a whip-smart, wisecracking Indian-Irish-Canadian joins his class, and after Jake meets the unforgettable Alba, who is as stunning as she is unattainable. Jake is tongue-tied around Alba and enlists Vanni's help. All of a sudden — like the Shakespeare play Jake's school is putting on — Jake finds himself entwined in a love triangle of sorts, complete with secrets and suppressed passions, contrived plots, miscues and misunderstandings.

"William Blake, John Commander (Foreword by), David Bindman (Introduction)",The Complete Illuminated Books,,,,"In his Illuminated Books, William Blake combined text and imagery on a single page in a way that had not been done since the Middle Ages. For Blake, religion and politics, intellect and emotion, mind and body were both unified and in conflict with each other: his work is expressive of his personal mythology, and his methods of conveying it were integral to its meaning. There is no comparison with reading books such as Jerusalem, America, and Songs of Innocence and of Experience in Blake's own medium, infused with his sublime and exhilarating colors. Tiny figures and forms dance among the lines of the text, flames appear to burn up the page, and dense passages of Biblical-sounding text are brought to a jarring halt by startling images of death, destruction, and liberation. Blake's hope that his books would obtain wide circulation was unfulfilled: some exist only in unique copies and none was printed in more than very small numbers. Now, for the first time, the plates from the William Blake Trust's Collected Edition have been brought together in a single volume, with transcripts of the texts and an introduction by the noted scholar David Bindman. Includes: Jerusalem; Songs of Innocence and of Experience; All Religions are One; There is No Natural Religion; The Book of Thel; The Marriage of Heaven and Hell; Visions of the Daughters of Albion; America a Prophecy; Europe a Prophecy; The Song of Los Milton a Poem; The Ghost of Abel; On Homers Poetry and] On Virgil; Laocoon; The First Book of Urizen; The Book of Ahania; The Book of Los.",,,11/05/74,April 17th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Art', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Romanticism', '18th Century', 'British Literature', 'History']",,9780500282458,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347732680l/23910.jpg,4.39,[],94.0,1.0,,23910.The_Complete_Illuminated_Books,,,,,95.0,3059.0,480,,Thames & Hudson,"['1851', '719', '351', '97', '41']",,,[],,
"William Bligh, Edward Christian, Robert D. Madison (Introduction)",The Bounty Mutiny,,English,,"The names William Bligh, Fletcher Christian, and the Bounty have excited the popular imagination for more than two hundred years. The story of this famous mutiny has many beginnings and many endings but they all intersect on an April morning in 1789 near the island known today as Tonga. That morning, William Bligh and eighteen surly seamen were expelled from the Bounty and began what would be the greatest open-boat voyage in history, sailing some 4,000 miles to safety in Timor. The mutineers led by Fletcher Christian sailed off into a mystery that has never been entirely resolved.While the full story of what drove the men to revolt or what really transpired during the struggle may never be known, Penguin Classics has brought together-for the first time in one volume-all the relevant texts and documents related to a drama that has fascinated generations. Here is the full text of Bligh's Narrative of the Mutiny, the minutes of the court proceedings gathered by Edward Christian in an effort to clear his brother's name, and the highly polemic correspondence between Bligh and Christian-all amplified by Robert Madison's illuminating Introduction and rich selection of subsequent Bounty narratives.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Emerging from his angst-filled childhood, he rushes into the throes of the twentieth century on the Western Front during the Great War, and quickly changes his role on the battlefield from cannon fodder to cameraman.

For Hope is a survivor of the devastating cruelities of apes and humans alike.

William Boyd,Any Human Heart,,English,,"Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling ""my personal rollercoaster""--or rather, ""not so much a rollercoaster"", but a yo-yo, ""a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child."" From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism, and abject poverty.Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. --Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk",,,01/25/02,January 6th 2004,['Logan Mountstuart'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Audiobook']",,9781400031009,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386912980l/77866.jpg,4.28,"['Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2002)', 'Prix Jean-Monnet de littérature européenne du département de Charente (2003)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2004)', 'LovelyBooks Leserpreis Nominee for Allgemeine Literatur (2009)']",1283.0,16.0,,77866.Any_Human_Heart,,,,,96.0,15861.0,480,,Vintage,"['7771', '5525', '1932', '487', '146']",,,"['London, England', 'England', 'Paris (France)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', 'Oxford University, Oxford, England', 'France', 'Spain', 'Bahamas', 'Nigeria']",,

William C. Bruce,Mindtronics! And Inquiry Alive!,,,,"Discrepant Events take Science and Social Studies to their Highest Level of Meaning These two books offer two different kinds of maps for teachers. Inquiry Alive offers a detailed plan of how to turn average lessons into astonishing inquiry lessons through discrepant events. Visualize, the Inquiry Alive lessons as maps that lead students on treasure hunts. Each hunt starts with a discrepant event. The hidden prize ends in the ultimate reward: problem-solving skills and accumulated knowledge students can apply. Deeper Topic Understanding Most teachers say that it's the discrepant event lessons in Mindtronics that sway students to reject shallow topic knowledge. As the taste for foods other than candy changes, so changes the taste for introspective learning. Think of learning that comes from the relevancies surrounding an unexplained account brought to light through gathering more details, debate, questioning, clarification, and brainstorming. After a few Mindtronics' lessons, students prefer deeper topic understanding as they learn how to follow the more discerning discrepant event clues. Clues and ambiguity drive the momentum to solve a discrepancy. As students begin to solve a discrepant event, they start with the lowest levels of learning: memory and simple comprehension. As students process the logic steps and the conceivability tactics, in theory building, they go to the highest levels of meaning of any topic: synthesis and evaluation. Yet, discourse on method is never the focus. Mindtronics follows the! ""practice makes skill"" path from Inquiry Alive with demonstrative lessons. Cognitive Dissonance and Agreement The books' examples and exercises help students commit to and welcome learning. The lessons in Mindtronics are designed to help students quickly evolve from low diagnostic thinking efficiency to execute highly specific critical thinking tasks. Using resources, cooperative ideas, and supportive analysis students go from assumptions, to data explanations, to insight, to conclusions. Both the cognitive dissonance and agreement turn the seemingly dull scientific method into exciting, clearly defined ways to apply the inquiry of events and issues found in science and social studies. The judicious yet student-centered methods of learning, in Mindtronics and Inquiry Alive, help teachers and students bring Life to the most arcane of events or issues. YES! Non-reading Students can do Inquiry! Non-reading elementary school students may not know what the word investigate means; yet, they own great analytical skills. All students examine, consider, and probe given discrepant event information. Students also form views and try to discover more about the practical details of each discrepant event. Group Therapy By using the interactive cognitive methods in Mindtronics and Inquiry Alive, students shape and sharpen their organized thought. Students' carry familiar ways to explore information; that knowledge, added to the group teamwork to gather scientific investigation, brings a self-awareness and self-belief much akin to the group therapy given to at-risk children and adults. Signposts to Answers and Increased Choices Although non-reading students may need the teacher to read the discrepant events and fact sheets, the students weigh their own theories and other student theories. Students learn how their questioning muscle can mark signposts to answers. Questioning increases choices. Choices build reliable knowledge, given and found. Then students support the most promising logic offered by applying what they've learned. The Pulse of Theories and Guesses Students learn about the pulse of theories and guesses, about trials-and-errors, the refining of clarifications, and how to synthesize knowledge. They now understand and connect their new and old knowledge. A student's individual reflection brings the sharing of conclusions as the student links the knowledge their group learned during questioning and during research and deliberation. Spine-tingling Excitement No one book on inquiry should answer all your questions. An inquiry book should create more questions than it should answer. That ambiguity is what makes inquiry teaching and learning fun and exciting.",,,,,[],,[],,9780970480156,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1179540172l/929267._SX318_.jpg,0.0,[],100.0,1.0,,929267.Mindtronics_And_Inquiry_Alive_,,,,,,0.0,,,,[],,,[],,
"William C. Bruce, Jean K. Bruce","Mindtronics: Science, Social Studies, Inquiry Alive!",,English,,"The textbook for conscientious teachers aspiring to teach with inquiry and technology is now even better. This new edition, an eBook connected to the Internet, is indispensable for students and practitioners, and has received attention from such educational icons as SocialEducation and The National Council for the Social Studies. Based on over 30 years of teaching, William C. Bruce, a Professor of Education, at the University of Texas at Tyler, shows teachers how organized mindteasing tempts students to use critical thinking. When Professor Bruce wrote his first inquiry books, 1992, teachers could find few books on the subject. Bruce says, ""Teachers, now, see the value of action by attraction, where new, old, or controversial issues can be explored safely through interactions starting with a mystery. Research, by Robert Provine, shows people are more likely to laugh in groups. Problem solving works best in groups."" This social aspect, plus the inclusion of all ability levels, sets Bruce's books on a different scale from other inquiry texts using the Web. The book's major aim is to show by example, through its 100 modules. The instructive text is college level, but the discrepant events cover grades 1-adult. Although Professor Bruce stresses the quality of knowledge gained from the liaisons inquiry generates, the book never wallows in the analysis of it. Bruce says, ""It's the anticipation or surprise. Solving ambiguities is an ancient, transgenerational practice for all ages, pulling people and data together."" The design moves teachers quickly through overviews, inviting them to read more focused details in the companion eBook, Inquiry Alive Mindtronics provides an index, and 3000+active Internet Links. Each module presents the following pattern: a discrepant event, discipline list, key concepts, problem statements, probable solutions, possible student hypotheses, fact sheets, references, resources with external URL links, and suggested grade levels.",,,,Published,[],,[],,9780970480132,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327993067l/5947993.jpg,0.0,[],99.0,1.0,,5947993-mindtronics,,,,,,0.0,555,,Home Tree Media,[],,,[],,

The fact is our world is mostly made from refined technology invented long ago. Shelter, transportation, medicine, even space exploration technology dates from more than half a century ago. The most innovative technology of our times is electronic, including computation, because it is the least regulated by the government. Regulation, taxation, and stagnation go together.

"William Cope Moyers, Katherine Ketcham (Goodreads Author)",Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption,,English,,"From rock bottom to recovery—the son of veteran broadcaster Bill Moyers chronicles his life- shattering battle with addiction and the hard-won fight for recovery  William Cope Moyers has come a long, long way. In 1994, he lay on the floor of an Atlanta crack house. His father had put together a search party. His worried family waited at home where Moyers had left them when he embarked on yet another binge. From that lowly, drug-hazed night, Moyers went on to become an executive at the Hazelden Foundation and travels far and wide to talk about addiction and treatment.  Broken tells the story of what happened between then and now—from growing up the privileged son of Bill Moyers to his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, his numerous stabs at getting clean, his many relapses, and how he managed to survive. Harrowing and wrenching, Broken paints a picture of a man with every advantage who nonetheless found himself spiraling into a dark and life-threatening abyss. But unlike other memoirs of its kind, Broken emerges into the clear light of Moyers’s recovery as he dedicates his life to changing the politics of addiction. Beautifully written with a deep underlying spirituality, this is a missive of hope for the scores of Americans struggling with addiction—and an honest and inspiring account that proves the spiritual insight that we are strongest at the broken places.",,,,September 21st 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Psychology', 'Mental Health', 'Biography', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Spirituality']",,9780670037896,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426997070l/126818.jpg,3.95,[],98.0,1.0,,126818.Broken,,,,,93.0,1977.0,384,,Viking Adult,"['690', '691', '448', '103', '45']",,,[],,

William Dalrymple,White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India,,English,,"White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time. James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—'Most excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",,,March 29th 2002,April 27th 2004,[],Paperback,"['History', 'India', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Travel', 'Asia', '18th Century', 'Indian Literature', 'British Literature']",,9780142004128,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309285574l/124432.jpg,3.93,"['Wolfson History Prize (2003)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2004)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize Nominee (2003)']",26.0,1.0,,124432.White_Mughals,,,,,93.0,4091.0,580,,Penguin Books,"['1239', '1676', '900', '210', '66']",,,[],,

William Faulkner,Selected Short Stories of William Faulkner,,,Fiction,"From the Modern Library's new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner--also available are Snopes, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! William Faulkner was a master of the short story. Most of the pieces in this collection are drawn from the greatest period in his writing life, the fifteen or so years beginning in 1929, when he published The Sound and the Fury. They explore many of the themes found in the novels and feature characters of small-town Mississippi life that are uniquely Faulkner's. In ""A Rose for Emily,"" the first of his stories to appear in a national magazine, a straightforward, neighborly narrator relates a tale of love, betrayal, and murder. The vicious family of the Snopes trilogy turns up in ""Barn Burning,"" about a son's response to the activities of his arsonist father. And Jason and Caddy Compson, two other inhabitants of Faulkner's mythical Yoknapatawpha County, are witnesses to the terrorizing of a pregnant black laundress in ""That Evening Sun."" These and the other stories gathered here attest to the fact that Faulkner is, as Ralph Ellison so aptly noted, ""the greatest artist the South has produced.""

Although the novel's complex and fragmented structure poses considerable difficulty to readers, the book's literary merits place it squarely in the ranks of America's finest novels.

In Mississippi ten years earlier, a convict sets forth across a flooded river, risking his own chance at freedom to rescue a pregnant woman. From these separate stories Faulkner composes a symphony of deliverance and damnation, survival and self-sacrifice, a novel in which elemental danger is juxtaposed wiht fatal injuries of the spirit.

It recounts how the wily, cunning Flem Snopes dominates the rural community of Frenchman's Bend - and claims the voluptuous Eula Varner as his bride. The Town, the second novel, records Flem's ruthless struggle to take over the county seat of Jefferson, Mississippi. Finally, The Mansion tells of Mink Snopes, whose archaic sense of honor brings about the downfall of his cousin Flem.

William Finnegan,Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life,,English,,"A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed New Yorker writerBarbarian Days is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. Barbarian Days takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.Barbarian Days is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar.",,,,July 21st 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'History']",,9781594203473,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418768620l/18693910.jpg,4.23,"['Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (2016)', 'William Hill Sports Book of the Year (2016)']",90.0,1.0,,18693910-barbarian-days,,,,,96.0,18797.0,447,,Penguin Press,"['8656', '6724', '2659', '609', '149']",,,[],,

His teachers would rather be elsewhere, his principal doubles as a bank president, his Long Island classroom mirrors the world he sees around him -- a world of public relations and private betrayals where everything (and everyone) wears a price tag, a world of ""deals"" where honesty is no substitute for experience, and the letter of the law flouts its spirit at every turn. Operating from the remote anonymity of phone booths and the local post office, with beachheads in a seedy New York cafeteria and a catastrophic, carton-crammed tenement on East 96th Street, J R parlays a deal for thousands of surplus Navy picnic forks through penny stock flyers and a distant textile-mill bankruptcy into a nationwide, hydra-headed ""family of companies.""The J R Corp and its Boss engulf brokers, lawyers, Congressmen, disaffected school teachers and disenfranchised Indians, drunks, divorcées, second-hand generals, and a fledgling composer hopelessly entangled in a nightmare marriage of business and the arts. Their bullish ventures -- shaky mineral claims and gas leases, cost-plus defense contracts, a string of nursing homes cum funeral parlors, a formula for frozen music -- burgeon into a paper empire ranging from timber to textiles, from matchbooks to (legalized) marijuana, from prostheses to publishing, inadvertently crushing hopes, careers, an entire town, on a collision course with the bigger world . . . the pragmatic Real World where the business of America is business, where the stock market exists as a convenience, and the tax laws make some people more equal than others . . . the world that makes the rules because it plays to win, and plays for keeps.Absurdly logical, mercilessly real, gathering its own tumultuous momentum for the ultimate brush with commodity trading when the drop in pork belly futures masks the crumbling of our own, J R captures the reader in the cacophony of voices that revolves around this young captive of his own myths -- voices that dominate the book, talking to each other, at each other, into phones, on intercoms, from TV screens and radios -- a vast mosaic of sound that sweeps the reader into the relentless ""real time"" of spoken words in a way unprecedented in modern fiction. The disturbing clarity with which this finished writer captures the ways in which we deal, dissemble, stumble through our words -- through our lives -- while the real plans are being made elsewhere makes J R the extraordinary novel that it is.--From the first-edition dustjacket",,,10/12/75,August 26th 1993 ,['J R Vansant'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'The United States Of America', 'Contemporary', 'United States']",,9780140187076,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1269794339l/28434.jpg,4.29,['National Book Award for Fiction (1976)'],732.0,8.0,,28434.JR,,,,,93.0,2700.0,752,,,"['1514', '713', '282', '119', '72']",,,[],,

William Golding,Lord of the Flies,,English,,"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”",,Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century,09/17/54,10/01/99,"['Ralph', 'Piggy', 'Roger', 'Jack Merridew', 'Simon']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'School', 'Literature', 'Dystopia', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'High School', 'Adventure']",,9780140283334,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409l/7624.jpg,3.69,[],773560.0,8230.0,,7624.Lord_of_the_Flies,,,,,86.0,2263259.0,182,,Penguin Books,"['617568', '763438', '555614', '205804', '120835']",,,[],,

"William Hare, Ken Annakin (Foreword by)","Early Film Noir: Greed, Lust and Murder Hollywood Style",,English,,"The name is French and it has connections to German expressionist cinema, but film noir was inspired by the American Raymond Chandler, whose prose was marked by the gripping realism of seedy hotels, dimly lit bars, main streets, country clubs, mansions, cul-de-sac apartments, corporate boardrooms, and flop houses of America. Chandler and the other writers and directors, including James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, Jane Greer, Ken Annakin, Rouben Mamoulian and Mike Mazurki, who were primarily responsible for the creation of the film noir genre and its common plots and themes, are the main focus of this work. It correlates the rise of film noir with the new appetites of the American public after World War II and explains how it was developed by smaller studios and filmmakers as a result of the emphasis on quality within a deliberately restricted element of cities at night.

William Haylon (Goodreads Author),I'm Will,,English,,"In his parents’ minds, Will was an underachiever. So they decided he should go to an expensive private high school that they couldn’t really afford. They assumed smaller classes and an ostentatious campus would help him overcome his enduring indifference to growing up. Will watched as his father wrote some great essays for his applications. Still he only got into a single school of the nine to which he applied--off the wait list when another family couldn’t afford the tuition.When Will arrived for his freshman year (or Class IV as the school called it), he quickly recognized he would rather be just about anywhere else. Over the next four years, he grew a foot, developed a dusting of facial hair, and mostly completed over six hundred nights of homework assignments. Among other things, he also was regularly grounded by his parents for uninspiring grades, was caught cheating, was introduced to alcohol, and had his heart tortured by a lesbian schoolmate with whom he was hopelessly in love.His final summer of high school is spent living in a monastery in Connecticut and working in Manhattan. His parents thought living with priests would help him develop more discipline and a healthier set of values. Instead, each evening he rode the commuter train home in the bar car with a group of adults he serendipitously met and provided him with a different kind of education than his parents’ had intended. Will’s life may have lacked purpose, but their standards were well below his own—and yet they were all successful in the ways that his school and his parents measured success.As punishment for some of his high school misadventures, Will had to write a thesis about someone he found interesting. He decided to write about himself. The result is I’m Will which shares an introspective glimpse into his struggle to find himself in the confusing and contradictory world of growing up.

Never before had a medium possessed such power to influence. Yet Hollywood’s glittering ascendency was threatened by a string of headline-grabbing tragedies—including the murder of William Desmond Taylor, the popular president of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a legendary crime that has remained unsolved until now.In a fiendishly involving narrative, bestselling Hollywood chronicler William J. Mann draws on a rich host of sources, including recently released FBI files, to unpack the story of the enigmatic Taylor and the diverse cast that surrounded him—including three beautiful, ambitious actresses; a grasping stage mother; a devoted valet; and a gang of two-bit thugs, any of whom might have fired the fatal bullet. And overseeing this entire landscape of intrigue was Adolph Zukor, the brilliant and ruthless founder of Paramount, locked in a struggle for control of the industry and desperate to conceal the truth about the crime. Along the way, Mann brings to life Los Angeles in the Roaring Twenties: a sparkling yet schizophrenic town filled with party girls, drug dealers, religious zealots, newly-minted legends and starlets already past their prime—a dangerous place where the powerful could still run afoul of the desperate.A true story recreated with the suspense of a novel, Tinseltown is the work of a storyteller at the peak of his powers—and the solution to a crime that has stumped detectives and historians for nearly a century.",,,January 1st 2014,October 14th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Film', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Adult']",,9780062242167,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407108939l/20663064.jpg,3.59,['Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime (2015)'],28.0,1.0,,20663064-tinseltown,,,,,89.0,3995.0,463,,Harper,"['664', '1545', '1336', '372', '78']",,,[],,

William James,"Writings, 1878-1899",,,Fiction,"William James, a member of America's most illustrious intellectual family, is widely acclaimed as the country's foremost philosopher, the first of its psychologists, and a champion of religious pluralism. As the apostle of pragmatism, his influence on American thought is as strong now as it has ever been. James's emphasis on the creative power of faith, will, and action, his opening up of philosophy to the fresh air of ordinary experience, his fascination with alternative forms of belief and states of consciousness, and his impatience with dogmas of any kind--all make him a defender of individual experience, and earn him a place beside Emerson and Whitman as an exponent of American democratic culture. In this volume are the brilliant, engagingly written works of James's early and middle years. The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy advances the liberating argument that each of us has the right to believe in hypotheses that are not susceptible to proof and that such beliefs might actually change the world. The conversational style of these essays reflects their origin in public lectures, as well as James's conviction that truth can be discovered as much in the course of everyday life as in the activities of science or of philosophical speculation. Talks to Teachers and to Students, also drawn from lectures, helped transform the emerging science of education. Here James applies his new psychology to classroom theory and conduct, especially for the primary grades. This immensely influential book has never gone out of print. It emphasizes the role in learning of instinct, play, and habit, along with the importance of engaging the voluntary interests of students. James's warm and sympathetic nature informs his treatment of children, who can best be taught by those who respect the child's autonomy and who avoid what he calls ""hammering in."" Psychology: Briefer Course is far more than a shortened version of his monumental Principles of Psychology. It significantly revises parts of the earlier work and adds important new materials. (Students liked to call the longer book ""James"" and the shorter one ""Jimmy"".) James's new psychology moved away from discussions of the soul, morality, and logic, and focused instead on instinct, will, and the importance of action and habit. Passages comparing human consciousness to ""a wonderful stream"" inspired the ""stream of consciousness"" in the future work of Joyce, Woolf, and Gertrude Stein, a student of James's at Harvard. ""Human Immortality,"" which defends the possibility of life after death, and eight more of James's most important essays round out this second volume devoted to a writer who was called by John Dewey ""almost a Columbus of the inner world.""",,,,1992.0,,,,0940450720,9780940450721,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rr6kPc52tI4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.22,,,,,,,,,,,,1212.0,,,,87.0,,,,
William James,The Varieties of Religious Experience,,English,,"""I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.""  When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on ""natural religion,"" he defined religion as ""the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine."" Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading The Varieties of Religious Experience, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which ""the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions."" It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.",,,10/28/01,September 22nd 2000,"['George Fox', 'Walt Whitman']",Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Classics', 'Science', 'Theology', 'History', 'Sociology']",,9781402199035,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1167956957l/28820._SX318_.jpg,3.98,[],396.0,5.0,,28820.The_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience,,,,,91.0,10617.0,519,,Adamant Media Corporation,"['4123', '3535', '1962', '612', '385']",,,[],,

"William Kamkwamba (Goodreads Author), Bryan Mealer",The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope,,English,,"William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, a country where magic ruled and modern science was mystery. It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala—crazy—but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity—electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.Soon, news of William's magetsi a mphepo—his ""electric wind""—spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.

It was a time of innocence and hope for a country with a new, young president. But for thirteen-year-old Frank Drum it was a grim summer in which death visited frequently and assumed many forms. Accident. Nature. Suicide. Murder. Frank begins the season preoccupied with the concerns of any teenage boy, but when tragedy unexpectedly strikes his family— which includes his Methodist minister father; his passionate, artistic mother; Juilliard-bound older sister; and wise-beyond-his-years kid brother— he finds himself thrust into an adult world full of secrets, lies, adultery, and betrayal, suddenly called upon to demonstrate a maturity and gumption beyond his years. Told from Frank’s perspective forty years after that fateful summer, Ordinary Grace is a brilliantly moving account of a boy standing at the door of his young manhood, trying to understand a world that seems to be falling apart around him.

William L. Shirer,Berlin Diary,"The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934-1941",,Biography & Autobiography,"By the acclaimed journalist and bestselling author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, this day-by-day, eyewitness account of the momentous events leading up to World War II in Europe is now available in a new paperback edition. CBS radio broadcaster William L. Shirer was virtually unknown in 1940 when he decided there might be a book in the diary he had kept in Europe during the 1930s—specifically those sections dealing with the collapse of the European democracies and the rise of Nazi Germany. Berlin Diary first appeared in 1941, and the timing was perfect. The energy, the passion, the electricity in it were palpable.

William L. Shirer,The Collapse of the Third Republic,,English,,"On June 17, 1940 William L. Shirer stood in the streets of Paris and watched the unending flow of gray German uniforms along its boulevards. In just six lovely weeks in the spring and summer of 1940 a single battle brought down in total military defeat one of the world's oldest, greatest, and most civilized powers—the second mightiest empire on earth and the possessor of one of the finest military machines ever assembled. How did it happen? After nearly a decade of research in the massive archives left from World War II and after hundreds of conversations with the Third Republic's leaders, generals, diplomats, and ordinary citizens, Shirer presents the definitive answer in his stunning re-creation of why and how France fell before Hitler's armies in 1940. His book is also a devastating examination of the confusion, corruption, and cynicism that drained the strength and toughness of a democracy which Thomas Jefferson once called ""every man's second country.""

William L. Shirer,The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,,English,,"Hitler boasted that The Third Reich would last a thousand years. It lasted only 12. But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading",,50th Anniversary Edition,10/17/60,November 15th 1990,[],Mass Market Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Politics', 'Germany', 'Historical', 'Military Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'Military History']",,9780671728687,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171.jpg,4.17,"['National Book Award for Nonfiction (1961)', 'Cornelius Ryan Award (1960)']",2505.0,39.0,,767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich,,,,,94.0,101287.0,1614,,Simon & Schuster,"['46771', '33009', '15685', '3527', '2295']",,,[],,

The average Christian does not realize that there is an intellectual war going on in the universities and in the professional journals and scholarly societies. Christianity is being attacked from all sides as irrational or outmoded, and millions of students, our future generation of leaders have absorbed this viewpoint. This is a war which we cannot afford to lose.... ""In addition to serving, like the rest of theology in general, as an expression of our loving God with all our minds, apologetics specifically serves to show to unbelievers the truth of the Christian faith, to confirm that faith to believers, and to reveal and explore the connections between Christian doctrine and other truths.... Apologetics... is a theoretical discipline that tries to answer the question, What rational defense can be given for the Christian faith?""This book by respected philosopher and theologian William Lane Craig has been thoroughly revised and updated to equip believers in the successful proclamation of biblical truth claims.

William Lane Craig,Time And Eternity: Exploring God's Relationship To Time,,English,,"Time and Eternity deals with difficult issues in modern physics and brings them into relation with traditional theological doctrines. Craig has done a great work, and it is marvelous that now the philosophy of religion is engaging with the philosophy of science to the great benefit of both.--John R. LucasFellow of Merton College, Oxford University Time and Eternity offers a comprehensive discussion of the problems in the concepts of time and eternity on the basis of an extraordinary familiarity with a vast number of recent contributions to this issue from scientists and philosophers. The argument is subtle and precise. Particularly important are the sections on the impact of the different versions of relativity theory on the concept of time.... The book offers a plausible argument for a realistic conception of temporal process and for God's involvement in the temporal distinctions and processes because of His presence in His creation.--Wolfhart PannenbergProfessor of Systematic TheologyLudwig Maximilliens Universitaet-Muenchen, Germany As a scientist doing theoretical research in gravitational physics and quantum cosmology, I found Dr. Craig's thoughtful book highly interesting. He has carefully given arguments defending several different viewpoints for each of the many issues about time that he discusses, followed by critiques in which he emphasizes his own opinion. Reading Time and Eternity has forced me to develop better arguments for my own opinions (which differ considerably from Craig's).... I am certain that Time and Eternity will also stimulate your thinking about this fascinating subject and your appreciation for the God who created time as part of the marvelous universe He has given us.--Don N. PageProfessor of Physics and Fellow of the Cosmology and Gravitation Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced ResearchUniversity of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada William Lane Craig is one the leading philosophers of religion and one of the leading philosophers of time. In this book, he combines his expertise in these areas to produce an original, erudite, and accessible theory of time and God that will be of great interest to both the general public and scholars. It is a rewarding experience to read through this brilliant and well-researched book by one of the most learned and creative thinkers of our era.--Quentin SmithProfessor of Philosophy, Western Michigan University In Time and Eternity, William Lane Craig defends the remarkable conclusion that ""God is timeless without creation and temporal since creation."" Craig argues his case philosophically by carefully weighing evidence for and against divine temporality and personhood in light of dynamic versus static theories of time and their warrants, in turn, in a Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity and an objective, mind-independent theory of becoming, including fascinating excursions into Big Bang cosmology and the philosophy of mathematics. As the latest in his series of ground-breaking books, Time and Eternity summarizes and extends Craig's previous technical arguments and conveys them to a more general audience. It is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in the problem of time and eternity in Christian philosophy.--Robert RussellProfessor of Theology and ScienceGraduate Theological Union, Berkeley, Calif. The nature of time is a continuing source of puzzlement both to science and in everyday life. It is also an important issue in theological understandings of the nature of God. In this interesting book, Professor Craig tackles this complex set of topics in a clear way.

"William Lane Craig, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong",God?: A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist,,English,,"The question of whether or not God exists is profoundly fascinating and important. Now two articulate spokesmen--one a Christian, the other an atheist--duel over God's existence in an illuminating battle of ideas.  In God? A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist, William Lane Craig and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong bring to the printed page two debates they held before live audiences, preserving all the wit, clarity, and immediacy of their public exchanges. Avoiding overly esoteric arguments, they directly address issues such as religious experience, the Bible, evil, eternity, the origin of the universe, design, and the supposed connection between morality and the existence of God. Employing sharp and humorous arguments, each philosopher strikes quickly to the heart of his opponent's case. For example, Craig claims that we must believe in God in order to explain objective moral values, such as why rape is wrong. Sinnott-Armstrong responds that what makes rape wrong is the harm to victims of rape, so rape is immoral even if there is no God. By assuming a traditional concept of God in their discussion, the authors ensure that they are truly addressing each other's viewpoints and engaging in a disagreement over a unified issue. The book is composed of six chapters that alternate between Craig and Sinnott-Armstrong, so that each separate point can be discussed as it arises. Ideal for courses in the philosophy of religion and introduction to philosophy, this lively and direct dialogue will stimulate students and anyone interested in the existence of God, regardless of whether or not they believe in God.",Point/Counterpoint,,11/06/03,February 12th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Theology', 'Atheism', 'Christian', 'Science', 'Christianity', 'God']",,0000195166000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348437745l/173129.jpg,3.76,[],93.0,1.0,,173129.God_,,,,,90.0,272.0,156,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['74', '92', '80', '19', '7']",,,[],,

American Ground is a tour of this intense, ephemeral world and those who improvised the recovery effort day by day, and in the process reinvented themselves, discovering unknown strengths and weaknesses. In all of its aspects--emotionalism, impulsiveness, opportunism, territoriality, resourcefulness, and fundamental, cacophonous democracy--Langewiesche reveals the unbuilding to be uniquely American and oddly inspiring, a portrait of resilience and ingenuity in the face of disaster.",,,10/24/02,September 11th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'New York', 'American History', 'The United States Of America', 'Politics', 'Journalism', 'War', 'Cities', 'Audiobook']",,9780865476752,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403155594l/170505.jpg,4.09,"['New York City Book Award for Journalism (2002)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2002)']",84.0,1.0,,170505.American_Ground,,,,,96.0,742.0,240,,North Point Press,"['270', '309', '131', '26', '6']",,,[],,
William Lawrence Shirer,The Collapse of the Third Republic,An Inquiry Into the Fall of France in 1940,,History,"On June 17, 1940 William L. Shirer stood in the streets of Paris and watched the unending flow of gray German uniforms along its boulevards. In just six lovely weeks in the spring and summer of 1940 a single battle brought down in total military defeat one of the world's oldest, greatest, and most civilized powers—the second mightiest empire on earth and the possessor of one of the finest military machines ever assembled. How did it happen? After nearly a decade of research in the massive archives left from World War II and after hundreds of conversations with the Third Republic’s leaders, generals, diplomats, and ordinary citizens, Shirer presents the definitive answer in his stunning re-creation of why and how France fell before Hitler's armies in 1940. His book is also a devastating examination of the confusion, corruption, and cynicism that drained the strength and toughness of a democracy which Thomas Jefferson once called ""every man's second country."" This book complements and completes the dramatic story of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and continues to rank as one of the most important works of history of our time.",,,,1994.0,,,,0306805626,9780306805622,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IdyBPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.2,,,,,,,,,,,,1082.0,,,,497.0,,,,
William Least Heat-Moon,River-Horse,,English,,"On the Road AgainThere's no shortage of 20th-century literature about traveling across America in a car. Even William Least Heat-Moon, author of River Horse, wrote a nonfiction work about his search in a beat-up Ford for himself and America (Blue Highways). But not since the 19th-century adventures of Mark Twain, as told in Life on the Mississippi, have readers had the chance to vicariously take a journey across America by water rather than by road. River Horse, a voyage across America's waterways, is a return to a bygone literary tradition. Following in the footsteps of America's greatest explorers, from Henry Hudson to Lewis and Clark, Heat-Moon traveled around the waterways of America in a 22-foot cruiser boat called Nikawa (Osage for ""river horse""). Heat-Moon covers 5,000-plus miles in four months, departing from Astoria, New York, and completing his journey in Astoria, Oregon.

William MacAskill (Goodreads Author),Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference,,English,,"Most of us want to make a difference. We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy, choose careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes. How can we do better? While a researcher at Oxford, trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact, William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed effective altruism, a practical, data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it’s not enough to simply do good; we must do good better. At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit, and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios, MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance, he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity’s effectiveness; and, it generally doesn’t make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief. MacAskill urges us to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this—when we apply the head and the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.",,,,July 28th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Society', 'Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Personal Development']",,9781592409105,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414351487l/23398748.jpg,4.24,[],196.0,2.0,,23398748-doing-good-better,,,,,96.0,3808.0,272,,Avery,"['1753', '1385', '530', '117', '23']",,,[],,

In this, the first volume, Manchester follows Churchill from his birth to 1932, when he began to warn against the re-militarization of Germany. Born of an American mother and the gifted but unstable son of a duke, his childhood was one of wretched neglect. He sought glory on the battlefields of Cuba, Sudan, India, South Africa and the trenches of France. In Parliament he was the prime force behind the creation of Iraq and Jordan, laid the groundwork for the birth of Israel, and negotiated the independence of the Irish Free State. Yet, as Chancellor of the Exchequer he plunged England into economic crisis, and his fruitless attempt to suppress Gandhi's quest for Indian independence brought political chaos to Britain. Throughout, Churchill learned the lessons that would prepare him for the storm to come, and as the 1930's began, he readied himself for the coming battle against Nazism--an evil the world had never before seen.",,,,1983.0,,,,0316545031,9780316545037,,,4.43,,,,,,,,,,,,992.0,,,,328.0,,,,

William Manchester,"The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Alone, 1932-40",,English,,"In this powerful biography, the middle volume of William Manchester’s critically acclaimed trilogy, Winston Churchill wages his defining campaign: not against Hitler’s war machine but against his own reluctant countrymen. Manchester contends that even more than his leadership in combat, Churchill’s finest hour was the uphill battle against appeasement. As Parliament received with jeers and scorn his warnings against the growing Nazi threat, Churchill stood alone—only to be vindicated by history as a beacon of hope amid the gathering storm. Praise for The Last Lion: Alone   “Manchester has such control over a huge and moving narrative, such illumination of character . . . that he can claim the considerable achievement of having assembled enough powerful evidence to support Isaiah Berlin’s judgment of Churchill as ‘the largest human being of our time.’”—The New Yorker

The Churchill conjured up by William Manchester and Paul Reid is a man of indomitable courage, lightning fast intellect, and an irresistible will to action. The Last Lion brilliantly recounts how Churchill organized his nation's military response and defense; compelled FDR into supporting America's beleaguered cousins, and personified the ""never surrender"" ethos that helped the Allies win the war, while at the same time adapting himself and his country to the inevitable shift of world power from the British Empire to the United States.More than twenty years in the making, The Last Lion presents a revelatory and unparalleled portrait of this brilliant, flawed, and dynamic leader.

"William McDonough, Michael Braungart",Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things,,English,,"""Reduce, reuse, recycle,"" urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.Waste equals food. Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being ""recycled"" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well.",,,10/30/02,April 22nd 2002,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Sustainability', 'Environment', 'Design', 'Science', 'Architecture', 'Business', 'Green', 'Economics', 'Ecology']",,9780865475878,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417605547l/5571.jpg,4.11,[],97.0,1.0,,5571.Cradle_to_Cradle,,,,,96.0,10177.0,193,,North Point Press,"['3919', '3958', '1859', '366', '75']",,,[],,
William McPherson,Testing the Current,,English,,"Growing up in a small upper Midwestern town in the late 1930s, young Tommy MacAllister is scarcely aware of the Depression, much less the rumblings of war in Europe. For his parents and their set, life seems to revolve around dinners and dancing at the country club, tennis dates and rounds of golf, holiday parties, summers on The Island, and the many sparkling occasions full of people and drinks and food and laughter. With his curiosity and impatience to grow up, however, Tommy will soon come to glimpse something darker beneath the genteel complacency: the embarrassment of poor relations; the subtle (and not so subtle) slighting of the black or American Indian “help”; the discovery that not everybody in the club was Episcopalian; the mockery of President Roosevelt; the messy mechanics of sex and death; and “the commandment they talked least about in Sunday school,” adultery.In this remarkable 1984 debut novel, the Pulitzer Prize–winning book critic William McPherson subtly leavens his wide-eyed protagonist’s perspective with mature reflection and wry humor and surrounds him with a sizable cast of vibrant characters, creating a scrupulously observed, kaleidoscopic portrait that will shimmer in readers’ minds long after the final page is turned.",,,1984,June 1st 1985,[],Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Coming Of Age', 'The United States Of America', '20th Century', 'American', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Young Adult']",,9780671543044,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1295888899l/1850856.jpg,3.71,[],44.0,1.0,,1850856.Testing_the_Current,,,,,89.0,249.0,371,,Pocket Books / Washington Square Press,"['59', '92', '71', '20', '7']",,,['Michigan (United States)'],,

"William Morgan, Bill Morgan","The Typewriter Is Holy: the Complete, Uncensored History of the Beat Generation",,English,,"2014 ACKER AWARD WINNERAnyone who cares to understand the literary and cultural ferment of America in the later twentieth century must be familiar with the writings and lives of those scruffy bohemians known as the Beat Generation.In this highly entertaining work, Bill Morgan, the country’s leading authority on the movement and a man who personally knew most of the Beats, narrates the history of these writers as primarily a social group of friends, tracing their origins together during the World War II years to the full blossoming of their notoriety in the late 1950s to their profound influence on the social upheaval of the 1960s. Indeed, it is impossible to comprehend the sixties without first grasping the importance of the social ripples set in motion by the Beats a decade earlier.Although their prose and poetry varied in style and for the most part did not represent a genuine literary movement, the Beats, through their words and nonconformist lives, collectively posed a challenge to the staid and complacent America of the postwar years. They believed in free expression, opposing all censorship; they dabbled in free love; they practiced Eastern philosophy, leading to an embrace in America of alternative forms of spirituality; sooner than others, they watched with dismay the increasingly heavy hand of military and corporate culture in our national life; they embraced the aspirations, as well as the lingo, of urbanized black Americans. They believed in the liberating influence of hallucinogenic drugs.In short, the Beats were thoroughly American in their love of individual freedom. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that J. Edgar Hoover described them in 1960 as one of the three greatest threats to American security (after communism and intellectual ""eggheads"").The story that Bill Morgan tells has less to do with sociology than with social mingling. He traces the closely knit friendships of the Beat luminaries Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and the small army of other names. Although Kerouac, author of the much loved novel On the Road, was the most famous of the Beat writers, it was Ginsberg, Morgan contends, who resided at the center of the group and for more than two decades provided it with cohesion and a sense of direction.The Beats were not saints. They were sexually irresponsible, undependable in marriage (the movement could in fact fairly be described as misogynistic); they did too many drugs and consumed too much booze; the very quality that characterized their lives and writings—a fervent belief in spontaneity—destroyed some friendships. Indeed, Morgan’s story begins with a murder in New York’s Riverside Park in 1944.Bill Morgan has provided a sweeping, indispensable story about these discontented free spirits. We watch their peripatetic lives, their sexual misadventures, their ambivalent response to fame. We are reminded above all that while their personal lives may have not have been holy, their typewriters and their lasting words very much were.",,,04/28/10,May 11th 2010,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Poetry', 'Writing', 'American', 'Biography Memoir', 'Literary Criticism', 'Historical', 'Cult Classics']",,9781416597209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348650609l/8234195.jpg,3.97,[],92.0,1.0,,8234195-the-typewriter-is-holy,,,,,95.0,440.0,320,,Free Press,"['115', '219', '85', '21', '0']",,,[],,

William Nicholson,Amherst,,English,,"From an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and the author of Motherland, a novel about two love affairs set in Amherst—one in the present, one in the past, and both presided over by Emily Dickinson.Alice Dickinson, a young advertising executive in London, decides to take time off work to research her idea for a screenplay: the true story of the scandalous, adulterous love affair that took place between a young, Amherst college faculty wife, Mabel Loomis Todd, and the college’s treasurer, Austin Dickinson, in the 1880s. Austin, twenty-four years Mabel’s senior and married, was the brother of the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson, whose house provided the setting for Austin and Mabel’s trysts.Alice travels to Amherst, staying in the house of Nick Crocker, a married English academic in his fifties. As Alice researches Austin and Mabel’s story and Emily’s role in their affair, she embarks on her own affair with Nick, an affair that, of course, they both know echoes the affair that she’s writing about in her screenplay.Interspersed with Alice’s complicated love story is the story of Austin and Mabel, historically accurate and meticulously recreated from their voluminous letters and diaries. Using the poems of Emily Dickinson throughout, Amherst is an exploration of the nature of passionate love, its delusions, and its glories.

Better tomorrow than today."" Harder work means the citizens of Aramanth can keep moving forward to improved life stations--from Gray tenements and Orange apartments, upwards to glorious mansions of White.

Together, they set the orderly city on its ear by escaping Aramanth's walls for an adventure that takes them from city sewers to desert sandstorms. Guided by an archaic map, they know that if they can find the voice of the Wind Singer, an ancient and mysterious instrument that stands in the center of Aramanth, they can save their people from their dreamless existence.

It is here that he has vivid interactions with others he assumes are projections of his own subconscious, but whose directions he follows nonetheless with the possibility that they might lead to authenticity and perhaps, redemption.

William Queen,Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang,,English,,"In 1998, William Queen was a veteran law enforcement agent with a lifelong love of motorcycles and a lack of patience with paperwork. When a ""confidential informant"" made contact with his boss at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, offering to take an agent inside the San Fernando chapter of the Mongols (the scourge of Southern California, and one of the most dangerous gangs in America), Queen jumped at the chance, not realizing that he was kicking-starting the most extensive undercover operation inside an outlaw motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement.Nor did Queen suspect that he would penetrate the gang so successfully that he would become a fully ""patched-in"" member, eventually rising through their ranks to the office of treasurer, where he had unprecedented access to evidence of their criminal activity. After Queen spent twenty-eight months as ""Billy St. John,"" the bearded, beer-swilling, Harley-riding gang-banger, the truth of his identity became blurry, even to himself.During his initial ""prospecting"" phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol ""ol' lady"" after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend.Yet despite the constant criminality of the gang, for whom planning cop killings and gang rapes were business as usual, Queen also came to see the genuine camaraderie they shared. When his lengthy undercover work totally isolated Queen from family, his friends, and ATF colleagues, the Mongols felt like the only family he had left. ""I had no doubt these guys genuinely loved Billy St. John and would have laid down their lives for him. But they wouldn't hesitate to murder Billy Queen.""From Queen's first sleight of hand with a line of methamphetamine in front of him and a knife at his throat, to the fearsome face-off with their decades-old enemy, the Hell's Angels (a brawl that left three bikers dead), to the heartbreaking scene of a father ostracized at Parents' Night because his deranged-outlaw appearance precluded any interaction with regular citizens, Under and Alone is a breathless, adrenaline-charged read that puts you on the street with some of the most dangerous men in America and with the law enforcement agents who risk everything to bring them in.",,,11/06/05,March 28th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Motorcycle', 'Autobiography', 'History']",,9780345487520,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320416108l/104522.jpg,4.12,[],65.0,2.0,,104522.Under_and_Alone,,,,,97.0,4238.0,260,,Fawcett Books,"['1587', '1739', '786', '103', '23']",,,[],,

William S. Burroughs,The Western Lands,,English,,"The Western Lands is the eagerly awaited new novel by the most visionary American novelist of the twentieth century–a haunting Book of the Dead for the nuclear age.Every new work from the pen of William S. Burroughs is an important literary event. This is especially so in the case of The Western Lands. For in this novel, Burroughs completes a trilogy that began with Cities of the Red Night and The Place of Dead Roads, with a profound, revealing, and often astounding meditation on the themes of mortality, loneliness, nuclear peril–and the inextinguishable hope for an existence beyond bodily death.The symbolic vehicle Burroughs uses here is ancient Egyptian mythology, a long-standing interest of his. ""The Western Lands"" of the title are the territory to which the Egyptians believed the souls of the dead made a hazardous pilgrimage in their quest for true immortality. The questers–Joe the Dead, Kim Carsons, the scribe Neferti, Hassan i Sabbah, the Old Man of the Mountain–travel through an unmistakably Burroughs-esque universe of appalling danger and otherworldly beauty–now the back alleys of ancient Egypt, now bombed-out Berlin, now the Old West of the shootists. Their hallucinatory journeys express the author's belief that only through facing the most extreme dangers and testing the possibilities of biological mutation can man escape a dead-end world of blasted dreams and atomic finale. And presiding over all is the haunting figure of ""the old writer,"" who shares in the fate of his characters in being finally unable to write himself out of Time, and into Space.The Western Lands continues and extends one of the great literary odysseys of our time, adding to Burroughs's awesome literary style and black humor chilling touches of elegy and autobiography. It is at once Burroughs's most personal and most universal work, yet another masterwork from the reigning genius of the American literary avant-garde.",The Red Night Trilogy #3,,1987,1988,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', '20th Century', 'American', 'American Fiction', 'Mythology']",,9780140094565,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388701772l/257506.jpg,4.07,[],28.0,1.0,,257506.The_Western_Lands,,,,,94.0,1887.0,258,,Penguin Books,"['734', '683', '357', '88', '25']",,,[],,

William S. Burroughs,Queer,,English,,"Escrita en 1952 pero no publicada hasta 1985 debido a su franca plasmación del deseo homosexual, ""Queer"", obra temprana de William S.

Un álter ego del escritor, Lee, teje su tela amorosa en torno a Allerton, un joven ambiguo, indiferente como un animal. Deambula por locales cada vez más sórdidos, en los que pulula una fauna en estado de descomposición, y en esas excursiones, como un pícaro alienado, nos regala astillas radiactivas de su negrísimo humor. Para resolver sus obsesiones mortíferas y sexuales, Lee parte con su amigo a la búsqueda de la ayahuasca, droga absoluta capaz de otorgar el control total sobre los cerebros, y por eso mismo codiciada por Rusia y Estados Unidos... y por todo adicto. Dispuesto a abismarse en todos los peligros, como un santo o un criminal con orden de búsqueda y captura, Lee no tiene nada que perder.

"William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac",And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks,,English,,"On August 14, 1944, Lucien Carr, a friend of William S. Burroughs from St. Louis, stabbed a man named David Kammerer with a Boy Scout knife and threw his body in the Hudson River. For eight years, Kammerer had fawned over the younger Carr, but that night something happened: either Carr had had enough or he was forced to defend himself.The next day, his clothes stained with blood, Carr went to his friends Bill Burroughs and Jack Kerouac for help. Doing so, he involved them in the crime. A few months later, they were caught up in the crime in a different way. Something about the murder captivated the Beats, especially Kerouac and Burroughs, who decided to collaborate on a novel about the events of the previous summer. At the time, the two authors were still unknown, yet to write anything of note. Narrating alternating chapters, they pieced together a hard-boiled tale of bohemian New York during World War II, full of drugs and art, obsession and violence, with scenes and characters drawn from their own lives.They submitted their manuscript—called And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks after an absurd line from a radio bulletin about a circus fire—to publishers, but it was rejected and confined to a filing cabinet for decades. Finally published, at long last, And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks tells the story of Ramsay Allen and the object of his fixation, the charismatic, idealistic young Phillip Tourian. Phillip and his friends drink and dream in the bars and apartments of the West Village, until, with his friend Mike Ryko (Kerouac's narrator), he hatches a plan to ship out as a merchant marine. They'll catch a boat for France and jump ship, then make their way through the front to Paris. And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks is an engaging, fast-paced read that shows the two authors' developing styles. It is also an incomparable artifact, a legendary novel from the dawn of the Beat movement by two hugely influential writers.",,First Edition,10/29/45,2008,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Crime', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', '20th Century', 'Mystery', 'The United States Of America', 'LGBT']",,9780802118769,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328823945l/3297175.jpg,3.72,[],191.0,2.0,,3297175-and-the-hippos-were-boiled-in-their-tanks,,,,,92.0,10570.0,214,,Grove Press,"['2234', '4191', '3249', '744', '152']",,,[],,
"William S. Burroughs, James Grauerholz (Editor)",Interzone,,English,,"In 1954 William Burroughs settled in Tangiers, finding a sanctuary of sorts in its shadowy streets, blind alleys, and lowlife decadence. It was this city that served as a catalyst for Burroughs as a writer, the backdrop for one of the most radical transformations of style in literary history.Burroughs's life during this period is limned in a startling collection of short stories, autobiographical sketches, letters, and diary entries, all of which showcase his trademark mordant humor, while delineating the addictions to drugs and sex that are the central metaphors of his work. But it is the extraordinary ""WORD,"" a long, sexually wild and deliberately offensive tirade, that blends confession, routine, and fantasy and marks the true turning point of Burroughs as a writer-the breakthrough of his own characteristic voice that will find its full realization in Naked Lunch. James Grauerholz's incisive introduction sets the scene for this series of pieces, guiding the reader through Burroughs's literary evolution from the precise, laconic, and deadpan writer of Junky and Queer to the radical, uncompromising seer of Naked Lunch.

It is a candid eye-witness account of times and places that are now long gone, an unvarnished field report from the American post-war underground. Unafraid to portray himself in 1953 as a confirmed member of two socially-despised under classes (a narcotics addict and a homosexual), Burroughs was writing as a trained anthropologist when he unapologetically described a way of life - in New York, New Orleans, and Mexico City - that by the 1940's was already demonized by the artificial anti-drug hysteria of an opportunistic bureaucracy and a cynical, prostrate media. For this fiftieth-anniversary edition, eminent Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris has painstakingly recreated the author's original text, word by word, from archival typescripts and places the book's contents against a lively historical background in a comprehensive introduction.

William S. Peters Sr.,The Vine Keeper . . . messages in Poetry and Prose,,English,,"PrefaceOn the pages to come, awaits a journey as expressed through my verse. The words reflect an experiential-ness of my own and one that many of us at some level have had.The Vine Keeper is perhaps somewhat an “Egoic” examination of my inner self, my “Inner Child” and addresses many of the recurring questions and perhaps insights i may have had, or at least i thought i have had in my ‘Life Path’. Poetry for me as well as many others who i commune with tends to be the foundation of our Soul-felt reflections, our Emotions and the things we Think.One of my cherished quotes comes from the French Philosopher Descartes’ who coined the phrase ‘cogito ergo sum’ (i think therefore i am). Though many who read my work may defer in part or in its entirety from my perspectives, but what i must say is this . . . they are honest and therefore “Authentic” considerations of Creation, Life from most times a subjective point of view, and sometimes on rare occasions i touch on some things that may appear to be detached or quasi-objective.Throughout my life of wonder and discovery, my chief gripe perhaps would have been this. we are not taught to think creatively or independently of the machine.

Professor Holdsworth has performed a valuable service to lawyers and laymen alike in explaining these obscurities. And he has done much more than this. He has increased our admiration for the genius of Dickens by proving his great merit as a legal historian."": Zechariah Chafee, Jr. Harvard Law Review 42:286-8.",,,,2010.0,,,,1886363064,9781886363069,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_WdLFxkx6kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.67,,,,,,,,,,,,166.0,,,,3.0,,,,
"William Sears, Martha Sears",The Attachment Parenting Book: A Commonsense Guide to Understanding and Nurturing Your Baby,,English,,"America's foremost baby and childcare experts, William Sears M.D. and Martha Sears, R.N., explain the benefits -- for both you and your child -- of connecting with your baby early. Would you and your baby both sleep better if you shared a bed? How old is too old for breastfeeding? What is a father's role in nurturing a newborn? How does early attachment foster a child's eventual independence?  Dr. Bill and Martha Sears -- the doctor-and-nurse, husband-and-wife team who coined the term ""attachment parenting"" -- answer these and many more questions in this practical, inspiring guide. Attachment parenting is a style of parenting that encourages a strong early attachment, and advocates parental responsiveness to babies' dependency needs. The Attachment Parenting Book clearly explains the six ""Baby B's"" that form the basis of this popular parenting style: Bonding, Breastfeeding, Babywearing, Bedding close to baby, Belief in the language value of baby's cry, and Beware of baby trainers. Here's all the information you need to achieve your most important goals as a new parent: to know your child, to help your child feel right, and to enjoy parenting.",,,01/01/01,August 7th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Family', 'Childrens', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Education', 'Self Help', 'Reference', 'Adoption']",,9780316778091,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440180506l/44139._SX318_.jpg,4.18,[],75.0,1.0,,44139.The_Attachment_Parenting_Book,,,,,95.0,3196.0,192,,"Little, Brown Spark","['1424', '1119', '493', '112', '48']",,,[],,

Dr. Bill and Martha Sears draw from their vast experience both as medical professionals and as the parents of eight children to provide comprehensive information on virtually every aspect of infant care. Working for the first time with their sons Dr. Bob and Dr. Jim, both pediatric specialists in their own right, the Searses have produced a completely updated guide that is unrivaled in its scope and authority.

The Baby Book presents a practical, contemporary approach to parenting that reflects the way we live today. The Searses acknowledge that there is no one way to parent a baby, and they offer the basic guidance and inspiration you need to develop the parenting style that best suits you and your child.

Shakespeare builds many differences into his hero and heroine, including race, age, and cultural background. Yet most readers and audiences believe the couple's strong love would overcome these differences were it not for Iago, who sets out to destroy Othello. Iago's false insinuations about Desdemona's infidelity draw Othello into his schemes, and Desdemona is subjected to Othello's horrifying verbal and physical assaults.

William Shakespeare,The Merchant of Venice,,,Drama,"In The Merchant of Venice, the path to marriage is hazardous. To win Portia, Bassanio must pass a test prescribed by her father’s will, choosing correctly among three caskets or chests. If he fails, he may never marry at all. Bassanio and Portia also face a magnificent villain, the moneylender Shylock. In creating Shylock, Shakespeare seems to have shared in a widespread prejudice against Jews. Shylock would have been regarded as a villain because he was a Jew. Yet he gives such powerful expression to his alienation due to the hatred around him that, in many productions, he emerges as the hero. Portia is most remembered for her disguise as a lawyer, Balthazar, especially the speech in which she urges Shylock to show mercy that “droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.” The authoritative edition of The Merchant of Venice from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Alexander Leggatt The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

William Shakespeare,As You Like It,,,Drama,"Readers and audiences have long greeted As You Like It with delight. Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too. Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns crossdressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time. In other words, a boy played a girl playing a boy pretending to be a girl.

Some of it glorifies war, especially the choruses and Henry's speeches urging his troops into battle. But we also hear bishops conniving for war to postpone a bill that would tax the church, and soldiers expecting to reap profits from the conflict.

William Shakespeare,Henry IV,,,Drama,"Family relationships are at the center of Henry IV, Part 1. King Henry IV and Prince Hal form one major father-son pair, with Henry in despair because Hal lives a dissolute life. The father-son pair of Hotspur (Lord Henry Percy) and his father, the Earl of Northumberland, is in seeming contrast; the king envies Northumberland “his Harry,” wishing he could claim the gallant Hotspur as his own. Meanwhile, Hal has entered into a quasi-father-son relationship with a disreputable but amusing knight, Sir John Falstaff. Another strand of action centers on still more family relationships. Hotspur’s stand against Henry focuses on Hotspur’s brother-in-law, Mortimer. Mortimer, who fought against the Welsh magician Owen Glendower, was defeated and captured and has married Glendower’s daughter. King Henry pronounces Mortimer a traitor whom he will not ransom. Hotspur, in declaring war on Henry, sees himself as fighting for Mortimer, his wife’s brother.

William Shakespeare,Othello,,English,,"In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.",,,10/28/03,01/01/04,"['Iago', 'Bianca', 'Othello', 'Miguel Cássio', 'Desdêmona', 'Emilia', 'Rodrigo']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'School', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Read For School', 'Poetry', 'Tragedy']",,9780743477550,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105l/12996._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],47570.0,684.0,,12996.Othello,,,,,92.0,315131.0,314,,Simon Schuster,"['99073', '114139', '77115', '19456', '5348']",,,"['Venice (Italy)', 'Cyprus']",,

William Shakespeare,King Lear,,English,,"Shakespeare’s King Lear challenges us with the magnitude, intensity, and sheer duration of the pain that it represents. Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play-Scene-by-scene plot summaries-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books-An annotated guide to further readingEssay by Susan SnyderThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

William Shakespeare,As You Like It,,English,,"Readers and audiences have long greeted As You Like It with delight. Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too.Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns cross-dressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time.

"William Shakespeare, David Scott Kastan (Editor)","King Henry IV, Part 1",,English,,"
  
    David Scott Kastan lucidly explores the remarkable richness and the ambitious design of King Henry IV Part 1 and shows how these complicate any easy sense of what kind of play it is. Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical, comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes extensive discussion to the play's language, indicating how its insistent economic vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention on the central relationship between value and political authority. Kastan also covers the recurrence of the word ""honor"" in the text and the role that women play.  Appendices provide the sources of 1 Henry IV, discussions of Shakespeare's metrics, and the history of the manuscript.  The appendix on casting features a doubling chart to show which characters may be played by one actor.  Photographic images of the original Q0 Fragment, which is assumed to have been printed in Peter Short's printing house in 1598, appear in the fifth appendix. Finally, a reference section provides a list of abbreviations and references, a catalog of Shakespeare’s works and works partly by Shakespeare, and citations for the modern productions mentioned in the text, other collated editions of Shakespeare's work, and other related reading.
     
    The Arden Shakespeare has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.

"William Shakespeare, John Kerrigan (Editor)",The Sonnets and A Lover's Complaint,,English,,"William Shakespeare is a global icon for his plays such as Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet, but his poetic meditations on love are among the most powerful and evocative poems ever written. This Penguin Classics edition of Sonnets and A Lover's Complaint is edited by John Kerrigan.'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?'The language of Shakespeare's sonnets has become inseparable from the language of love in English; but the force and tenderness of these poems is undiminished by age. When this volume of Shakespeare's poems first appeared in 1609, he had already written most of the great plays that made him famous. The 154 sonnets - all but two of which are addressed to a beautiful young man, 'Mr W.H.', or a treacherous 'dark lady' - contain some of the most exquisite and haunting poetry ever written, and deal with eternal subjects such as love and infidelity, memory and mortality, and the destruction wreaked by Time. Also included is A Lover's Complaint, originally published with the sonnets, in which a young woman is overheard lamenting her betrayal by a heartless seducer.In his illuminating introduction, John Kerrigan examines how the sonnets are intertwined, the ways in which these works have been interpreted and the themes running through them. This edition also includes further reading, commentaries on each poem, a textual history, variant and further sonnets and an index of first lines.If you enjoyed Sonnets and A Lover's Complaint, you might like John Milton's Paradise Lost, also available in Penguin Classics.'Shakespeare led a life of allegory: his works are the comments on it'John Keats",,,11/06/09,April 29th 1999,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'English Literature', 'Classic Literature', 'British Literature', '17th Century', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780140436846,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375948373l/428537.jpg,4.25,[],58.0,1.0,,428537.The_Sonnets_and_A_Lover_s_Complaint,,,,,95.0,2169.0,458,,Penguin Classics,"['1088', '660', '323', '66', '32']",,,[],,

The debate was not about what gender the poems addressed but what specific young man had been the object of Shakespeare's affection. Read in sequence, the sonnets tell a story. Shakespeare was instructed by his patron to try to get the patron's son to marry and pass along his lineage and beauty. The first seventeen sonnets are therefore called the procreation sonnets because this is precisely Shakespeare's message to the boy. Beginning with Sonnet 18, however, we see an abrupt turn: Shakespeare has clearly fallen in love with the fifteen-year-old. Furthermore-and this cannot have pleased his patron-Shakespeare suggests there is really no need for the boy to marry and procreate in order to live beyond his time, for Shakespeare is immortalizing him for eternity through the sonnets.",,,,July 10th 2013,[],Paperback,['Poetry'],,9780615847672,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493238813l/18814756._SY475_.jpg,4.37,[],65.0,1.0,,18814756-sonnets-to-a-young-man,,,,,96.0,27.0,76,,Watersgreen House,"['16', '6', '4', '1', '0']",,,[],,

"William Shakespeare, Roma Gill (Editor)",Coriolanus,,English,,"After the exotic eroticism of Antony and Cleopatra, Shakespeare returned to Rome for one of his final tragedies, and the change could not have been more dramatic. Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's harshest and most challenging studies of power, politics and masculinity, based around the life of Caius Marcius.  Based on the Roman chronicles of Plutarch's Lives and Livy's History of Rome, the play is set in the early years of the Roman Republic. Its famous opening scene, particularly admired by Bertolt Brecht, portrays its citizens as starving and rebellious, and horrified by the arrogant and dismissive attitude of Caius Marcius, one of Rome's most valiant but also political naive soldiers. Spurred on by his ambitious mother Volumnia, Caius takes the city of Corioles, is renamed Coriolanus in honour of his victory, and is encouraged to run for senate. However, his contempt for the citizens, who he calls ""scabs"" and ""musty superfluity"" ultimately leads to his exile and destructive alliance with his deadly foe, Aufidius. Despite its relative unpopularity, Coriolanus is a fascinating study of both public and personal life. Its language is dense and complex, as its representation of the tensions built into the fabric of Roman political life. Yet it also contains extraordinarily intimate scenes between Coriolanus and both his mother, who ultimately proves ""most mortal"" to her own son, and his enemy Aufidius, whose ""rapt heart"" is happier to see Coriolanus than his own wife. One of Shakespeare's darker and more disturbing plays. --Jerry Brotton",,Oxford School Shakespeare,10/28/08,January 29th 2004,"['Gaius Marcius Coriolanus', 'Volumnia', 'Tullus Aufidius', 'Menenius', 'Brutus', 'Sicinius', 'Cominius', 'Virgilia', 'Valeria']",Paperback,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Poetry', 'British Literature', 'School']",,9780198320067,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347234589l/108171.jpg,3.72,[],404.0,5.0,,108171.Coriolanus,,,,,89.0,12881.0,208,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['3283', '4429', '3747', '1160', '262']",,,['Rome (Italy)'],,
"William Shakespeare, Roma Gill (Editor), Robert Jackson (Editor)",Richard II,,English,,"Written in 1595, Richard II occupies a significant place in the Shakespeare canon, marking the transition from the earlier history plays dominated by civil war and stark power to a more nuanced representation of the political conflicts of England's past where character and politics are inextricably intertwined. It is the first of four connected plays--including 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, and Henry V--generally considered Shakespeare's finest history plays.  The drama of Richard II centers on the power struggle between the grandiloquent King Richard and the plain-spoken, blunt Henry Bolingbroke, who is banished from Britain at the beginning of the play. But when Henry's father John of Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property with no regard to his son's rights, and Bolingbroke returns to confront the king, who surrenders his crown and is imprisoned in Pomfret Castle, where he is soon murdered. This new edition in the acclaimed Oxford Shakespeare series features a freshly edited version of the text. The wide-ranging introduction describes the play's historical circumstances, both the period that it dramatizes (the start of the ""wars of the roses"") and the period in which it was written (late Elizabethan England), and the play's political significance in its own time and our own. It also focuses on the play's richly poetic language and its success over the centuries as a play for the stage. Extensive explanatory notes help readers at all levels understand and appreciate the language, characters, and dramatic action and the book's lively illustrations provide a sense of the historical background and performance of the play.",Wars of the Roses #1,,10/28/95,December 18th 2003,"['Henry Percy ""Hotspur""', 'Henry V of England', 'John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster', 'Richard II of England', 'Henry IV of England', 'Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk', 'Edward of Langley, 2nd Duke of York', 'Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey', 'Sir Henry Greene', 'Sir Edward Bagot', 'Sir William Bushy', 'William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, King of Mann', 'Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester', 'Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland', 'Edward, 2nd Duke of York, Duke of Aumerle', 'Isabella of Valois', 'Joan Holland', 'John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury', 'Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley', 'Sir Stephen Scroop', 'Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle', 'William de Colchester, Abbott of Westminster', 'William de Ros, 6th Baron Ros', 'William Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby de Eresby', 'Walter FitzWalter, 4th (or 5th) Baron FitzWalter', 'Sir Piers Exton', 'Lord Marshal', 'Welsh Captain', '1st Herald', '2nd Herald', 'Gardener', ""1st Gardener's Man"", ""2nd Gardener's Man"", '1st Lady', '2nd Lady', 'Keeper of Pomfret Prison', 'Groom']",Paperback,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Literature', 'Poetry', 'School', 'Historical']",,9780198320043,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347228947l/82397.jpg,3.78,[],323.0,4.0,,82397.Richard_II,,,,,90.0,18627.0,168,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['5141', '6403', '5260', '1501', '322']",,,[],,

William Shakespeare;A. R. Humphreys,King Henry IV Part 2,Second Series,,Drama,"A. R. Humphreyswas Professor of English at Leicester University. He also editedKing Henry IV Part 1and Much Ado About Nothing for the Arden Second Series,King Henry VandKing Henry VIIIfor Penguin, andJulius Caesarfor the Oxford Shakespeare. In the introduction to this Arden edition ofKing Henry IV Part 2, A. R. Humphreys begins by discussing the original publication of the play, the establishing of its date, and the extent to which Shakespeare took liberties with historical facts in 1and2 Henry IV. The editor proceeds to examine the relationship between the twoHenry IVplays, considering historical evidence and previous critical analysis. In the following section, Humphreys analyzes the several probable sources for the play, six of which appear in full in an appendix. Later in the introduction, the editor devotes substantial sections of his own criticism to the play's style and themes, with individual sections dedicated to Falstaff and the infamous scene of his rejection by Prince Hal. Humphreys finally dissects problems of the early texts, going over the nuances of the Quarto and Folio editions and comparing the two. Before the actual text of the play, notes are given on the particularities of this edition and its references and abbreviations. Following the text ofKing Henry IV Part 2are eight appendices: ""Source Material""; ""Hall probably not a Source""; ""II. i. 88: The Singing-Man of Windsor""; ""Justice Shallow and Gloucestershire""; ""Gaultree""; ""The Continuity of Scenes in Act IV, i-ii, and iv-v""; ""IV. v. 20-30: 'Why doth the crown lie there . . .'""; and ""Henry and the Crusade."" The Arden Shakespearehas developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader. Table of Contents Preface INTRODUCTION 1. Publication 2. Date 3.

William Shakespeare;Adrian Poole,Henry IV Part Two,,,Literary Criticism,"Continuing the saga begun in Henry IV Part I, William Shakespeare's history play Henry IV Part II charts the continuing evolution of Prince Hal from roguish troublemaker to noble ruler of men. This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by Peter Davison with an introduction by Adrian Poole. Angered by the loss of his son in battle, the Earl of Northumberland supports another rebellion against King Henry IV, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Sick and weary, the old King sends out his forces, including the unruly Sir John Falstaff, to meet the rebels. But as the conflict grows, he must also confront a more personal problem - how to make his reprobate son Prince Hal aware of the duties he must bear, as heir to the throne. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare's life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Henry IV Part II, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

William Shakespeare;Peter Holland,The Merchant of Venice,,,Jews,"William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is both a witty comedy and a moving exploration of bigotry and stigmatisation, and this Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by W. Moelwyn Merchant with an introduction by Peter Holland. 'The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven' Bassanio, a noble but impoverished Venetian, asks his friend the merchant Antonio for a loan to impress an heiress. Antonio agrees, but is forced to borrow the sum from a cynical Jewish moneylender, Shylock, who forces him into a chilling contract, which stipulates he must honour the debt with a pound of his own flesh. But Bassanio's beloved is not as demure as she seems, and disguising herself as a lawyer, Portia proves herself one of Shakespeare's most cunning heroines, in a witty attack on Shylock's claim. A complex and controversial comedy, The Merchant of Venice explores prejudice and the true nature of justice. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare's life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to The Merchant of Venice, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary.

As thunder shakes the sky, the lights inside St. Thomas Church flicker . . . and then go out.All is black until a thick bolt of lightning slices the sky, striking the church’s large wooden cross—leaving it ablaze and splintered in two.When the storm ends—the search for answers begins.James Lindy, the church’s blind minister, wonders how his small congregation can repair the cross and keep their faith in the midst of adversity. And he hears the words “only believe.”Macey Lewis, the town’s brilliant young oncologist, is drawn to Alex, a young boy who’s recently been diagnosed with an aggressive leukemia.

But she only hears silence and wonders how she can possibly “only believe.”The Reason is a milestone debut novel, opening with a thunderbolt and never letting up as it introduces us to everyday characters who are wrestling with the questions: Where is God when bad things happen? And does God ignore the prayers of the faithful?

Liddell Hart, he understood before his contemporaries that wars and battles would be won ”more by the movement of troops than by fighting.” Also modern is his unsentimental view of combat, epitomized by his famous remark that ”War is hell.” And he was an able enough historian to realize that the Civil War—and indeed all future wars—would be unlike anything the world had ever seen: a bitter national struggle between free people that would involve a campaign of terror against combatant and non-combatant alike.His Memoirs, which rank with Grant's as the greatest of the Civil War, concern for the most part the strategy and fighting at Bull Run, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and of course the march through Georgia which earned Sherman his reputation for ruthlessness. It is a story packed with incident as well as swift sketches of his opponents, subordinates, and superiors, and it is endlessly instructive about the lessons of the war.

William Walker Atkinson,"The Four Arcanes: The Complete Arcane Collection of Four Books (the Arcane Teaching, Arcane Formulas, Vril & the Mystery of Sex)",,,,"This volume puts together for the first time in one volume, the Four Arcanes, the amazing books written by William Walker Atkinson about the Wisdom of the Ages, or "" Arcane Teaching"" The volumes are: The Arcane Teaching, The Arcane Formulas, Vril (Vital Magnetism) & The Mystery of Sex. Says Atkinson that ""The Arcane Teaching has come down to the present age through the corridors of time, from the dim ages of past eras, races, and schools of thought. Even those highest in the councils of ""The Custodians of The Scroll,"" are unable to trace the Teaching, in an unbroken direct line, further back than the time of Pythagoras (about 500 b. c.), and a little later in Ancient Greece, although they find many references to, and extracts from, the teachings of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, which serve to show that the Pythagorean and Ancient Grecian Arcane Schools were founded on occult instruction still more remote, received in a direct line of succession of teachers and pupils extending over centuries. Investigators have found traces of the Arcane Teaching in the records of Persia and Medea, and it is believed that the inspiration for the original philosophical teaching (not the religion or the pessimism, however) of Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was received from Arcane sources. Traces are also to be found in the Hebrew Esoteric Teachings of the ""Kabbalah"" and the ""Zohar.""The Grecian Arcane Teaching was undoubtedly obtained directly from Egyptian sources through Pythagoras, the relation between the early Grecian teaching and philosophies, and the older school of old Egypt, being very close and intimate. Pythagoras is known to have received instruction from Egyptian and Persian hierophants. Besides the traditions of the Arcanes, there is to be found the closest resemblance between the ancient Grecian teachings, and those of the Egyptian Esoteric Fraternities. Some of the Teachers, however, hold that the Grecian and Egyptian schools, respectively, were but two separate off shoots of an original and older Teaching which had its origin in the lost continent of Atlantis. There are many Arcane traditions connecting the Teaching with Atlantis, and it is possible that both Egypt and Greece received it from this common source, instead of Greece being indebted to Egypt for the line of transmission. But, be this as it may, it is a fact that all of the traces of teaching that the various occult schools gather from the traditions, scraps of doctrine, and legends regarding Atlantis can be reconciled with the Grecian Arcane Teaching.""",,,,December 12th 2015,[],Paperback,[],,9781522720140,,,4.33,[],98.0,1.0,,28279142-the-four-arcanes,,,,,100.0,3.0,332,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,[],,,[],,

The author takes us on an intensely personal journey into the practice of Nichiren Buddhism, which has now been embraced by many millions of people around the world.

He was much influenced by the events of the French Revolution in his youth, and he deliberately broke away from the artificial diction of the Augustan and neo-classical tradition of the eighteenth century. He sought to write in the language of ordinary men and women, of ordinary thoughts, sights and sounds, and his early poetry represents this fresh approach to his art. Wordsworth spent most of his adult life in the Lake District with his sister Dorothy and his wife Mary, by whom he had four children.

When it was first published, Lyrical Ballads enraged the critics of the day: Wordsworth and Coleridge had given poetry a voice, one decidedly different to what had been voiced before.

"William Zinsser, Albert Murray (Foreword)",Mitchell & Ruff: An American Profile in Jazz,,English,,"""Highly recommended""—Library Journal""In this account of the world adventures of two splendid jazz artists, Bill Zinsser has given us one of the most exciting books about America's original art form that I've ever read. It's a revelation.""—Studs TerkelSince 1955, Dwike Mitchell and Willie Ruff have been playing, teaching, and sharing jazz around the U.S. and around the world. William Zinsser, one of our finest chroniclers of American life, tells their story as he travels with the duo to China, to Davenport, Iowa, to New York City, and—with Willie Ruff—to St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, where Ruff journeys back to the roots of Western music in order to understand jazz's musical legacy.Zinsser also accompanies Mitchell and Ruff as they visit their hometowns in Florida and Alabama. We listen as the two men tell of growing up in small towns in the American South of the 1930s and 40s; as they tell about the teachers, community leaders, and family members who believed in two young black men with talent but no formal musical training; as they tell of their struggles, their perseverance, and their ultimate success.Jazz is indeed a uniquely American musical tradition, and there are no better guides to this inspiring art than Dwike Mitchell and Willie Ruff.""[This is a] thoughtful, adept, and satisfyingly unusual book of reportage…Though its contents are entirely factual, it concerns lives that give the sense of being but fatefully, imaginatively, arranged, and it constantly suggests improvisation—that is, 'something created during the process of delivery,' as Mr. Ruff explains the term to the Chinese…He also tells them improvisation is 'the lifeblood of jazz.' William Zinsser's book reminds us that improvisation is the lifeblood of life, too. [This book is also] about difficult passages that end in victorious arrival. Mitchell & Ruff is a deservedly happy book.""—New York Times Book Review""A highly infectious, Studs Terkel-like chronicle about the unorthodox development of two distinguished musicians.""—Publishers Weekly""Jazz came to China for the first time on the afternoon of June 2, 1981, when the American bassist and French-horn player Willie Ruff introduced himself and his partner, the pianist Dwike Mitchell, to several hundred students and professors who were crowded into a large room at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Probably they were not surprised to find that the two musicians were black…What they undoubtedly didn't expect was that Ruff would talk to them in Chinese.""—from Chapter 1, ""Shanghai""William Zinsser is a lifelong journalist and nonfiction writer—he began his career on the New York Herald Tribune in 1946—and is also a teacher, best known for his book On Writing Well, a companion held in affection by three generations of writers, reporters, editors, teachers, and students.

"Witold Gombrowicz, Alastair Hamilton (Translator)",Pornografia,,English,,"Gombrowicz's strange, bracing final novel probes the divide between young and old while providing a grotesque evocation of obsession. While recuperating from wartime Warsaw in the Polish countryside, the unnamed narrator and his friend, Fryderyk, attempt to force amour between two local youths, Karol and Henia, as a kind of a lewd entertainment. They become increasingly frustrated as they discover that the two have no interest in one another, and the games are momentarily stopped by a local murder and a directive to assassinate a rogue member of the Polish resistance. Gombrowicz connects these threads magnificently in a tense climax that imbues his novel with a deep sense of the absurd and multiplies its complexity. Gombrowicz is a relentless psychoanalyzer and a consummate stylist; his prose is precise and forceful, and the narrator's strained attempts to elucidate why he takes such pleasure at soiling youth creepily evoke authentic pride and disgust.

Gombrowicz publicó un libro que contenía sus primeros siete cuentos, escritos entre 1926 y 1932. Más tarde, en 1957, vuelve a recogerlos en otro libro, esta vez ya titulado Bakakaï, añadiéndoles tres cuentos más, escritos entre 1933 y 1946. Curiosamente, dispone los textos en orden cronológico inverso, de modo que el último en el índice es, de hecho, su primera obra escrita. Por su naturaleza profundamente impúdica, Bakakaï no vio la luz en la España franquista hasta que, en 1970, Tusquets Editores hizo el primer intento reduciéndolo a tres cuentos, publicados con el título de uno de ellos, La virginidad. Finalmente, en 1974, también en traducción del escritor mexicano Sergio Pitol, apareció Bakakaï en Barral Editores con sus diez cuentos completos. Nos alegra ahora poder rescatar otra vez esta obra de esa espléndida, pero a la vez desafortunada, lista de los libros «inencontrables».Poco antes de morir, Witold Gombrowicz definía así este libro suyo : «Cuando releo estos cuentos lejanos, advierto que hay riqueza en ellos y que vibran sorprendentes cortocircuitos. Confieso, no obstante, que en estas páginas hay un elemento morboso, repelente, repugnante incluso. Es cierto. Reconozcamos a pesar de todo que esos contenidos repelentes pierden repugnancia al convertirse en elementos de la Forma ; su papel es funcional, obedecen a un fin superior : a la creación artística».

But Olmsted's contemporaries knew a man of even more extraordinarily diverse talents. Born in 1822, he traveled to China on a merchant ship at the age of twenty-one. He cofounded The Nation magazine and was an early voice against slavery. He managed California's largest gold mine and, during the Civil War, served as the executive secretary to the United States Sanitary Commission, the precursor of the Red Cross.Rybczynski's passion for his subject and his understanding of Olmsted's immense complexity and accomplishments make his book a triumphant work.

Wolfgang Leonhard,Die Revolution entlässt ihre Kinder,,German,," Wolfgang Leonhards 1954 erstmals erschienenes Buch Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder, ist längst zu einem Klassiker der Kommunismusforschung avanciert. Zu Recht, denn auch nach 45 Jahren hat es nichts von seiner Aktualität und Brillanz verloren. Wer die inneren Funktionsmechanismen des Stalinismus verstehen will, kommt an Leonhards Buch nicht vorbei. Doch was macht das Besondere seiner Arbeit aus? Der Autor genießt einen entscheidenden Vorteil bei der Analyse des Stalinismus: Die Erfahrungen eines zehnjährigen Lebens in der Sowjetunion und der vierjährigen Tätigkeit als Funktionär im zentralen Apparat der SED-Führung. 1935 nach Moskau emigriert, erlebte Leonhard die große stalinistische Säuberung der Jahre 1936 bis 1938 und wurde ab 1942 auf der Schule der Kommunistischen Internationale zum Funktionär ausgebildet. Im Mai 1945 kehrte er zusammen mit Walter Ulbricht nach Deutschland zurück. Bis zu seiner überraschenden Flucht nach Jugoslawien im März 1949 war er im Zentralkomitee der KPD/SED mit der ideologischen Schulung der Parteifunktionäre betraut. In dieser Funktion lernte Leonhard viele der damaligen Repräsentanten der sowjetischen Besatzungszone und der späteren DDR persönlich kennen. Es ist diese intime Kenntnis der inneren Mechanismen des Systems: Die Möglichkeit, sich in die Menschen der kommunistischen Welt hineinzudenken und die Fähigkeit, die für viele so rätselhafte ideologische Wortklauberei entziffern zu können, die sein Werk auszeichnen. Vieles, was dem Außenstehenden oft so unwahrscheinlich anmutet, erscheint dem früheren Funktionär ""von drüben"" wie ein offenes Buch. Diese Kenntnisse befähigen Leonhard, die Entwicklungen in der kommunistischen Welt objektiv zu analysieren. ""Gleichermaßen entfernt von primitivem Antikommunismus und den Haßgefühlen, aber auch von Schönfärberei und Illusionen"", wie er 1990 anläßlich der Neuauflage von Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder schrieb. Es ist dieser unverfälschte Blick eines Insiders, der dem Buch jenes Maß an Authentizität und Glaubwürdigkeit verleiht, das es bis heute auszeichnet. --Stephan Fingerle",,,10/30/55,2005,"['Wolfgang Leonhard', 'Wilhelm Pieck', 'Walter Ulbricht', 'Susanne Leonhard', 'Paul Wandel', 'Rudolf Herrnstadt', 'Alfred Kurella', 'Ernő Gerő', 'Fritz Erpenbeck', 'Anton Ackermann', 'Otto Grotewohl']",Hardcover,"['Biography', 'German Literature', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'Autobiography', 'History']",,9783462034981,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383054649l/4128760.jpg,4.48,[],97.0,1.0,,4128760-die-revolution-entl-sst-ihre-kinder,,,,,99.0,115.0,698,,Kiepenheuer & Witsch,"['69', '33', '12', '1', '0']",,,"['Moscow (Russian Federation)', 'Karaganda (Kazakhstan)', 'Kushnarenkovo, Bashkortostan (Russian Federation)', 'Ufa (Russian Federation)', 'Berlin (Germany)', 'Soviet Occupation Zone (Germany)']",,

As a knight serving the German nobility in the imperial Hohenstauffen period, the author was uniquely placed to describe the zest and colour of his hero's world, with dazzling depictions of courtly luxury, jousting and adventure.

Un agente della Serenissima fugge verso oriente, smarrito, «l'anima rigirata come un paio di brache». Costantinopoli sarà l'approdo. Sulla vetta della potenza ottomana conoscerà Giuseppe Nasi, nemico e spauracchio d'Europa, potente giudeo che dal Bosforo lancia una sfida al mondo e a due millenni di oppressione.Intanto, ai confini dell'impero, un altro uomo si mette in viaggio, per l'ultimo appuntamento con la Storia. Porta al collo una moneta, ricordo del Regno dei Folli.Echi di rivolte, intrighi, scontri di civiltà. Nuove macchine scatenano forze inattese, incalzano il tempo e lo fanno sbandare. Nicosia, Famagosta, Lepanto: uomini e navi corrono verso lo scontro finale.Wu Ming, il collettivo di scrittori che al suo esordio si firmò «Luther Blissett», torna nel mondo del suo primo romanzo.«Molti credono che il Signore disperse le lingue degli uomini per punirli, ma è l'esatto contrario. Egli vide che l'uniformità li rendeva superbi, dediti a imprese tanto eccessive quanto inutili. Allora si rese conto che l'umanità aveva bisogno di un correttivo e ci fece dono delle differenze.Cosí i muratori, di costumi e fedi diversi, devono trovare un modus vivendi che consenta di portare a termine l'edificio».«- Tu hai mai avuto un sogno, Manuel?La risposta uscí come un singulto.- Sí, non essere giudeo. Fu mio padre ad avverarlo.- Ti capisco piú di quanto non immagini. Perché rimanere deboli quando si può diventare forti?Ma io non mi accontento di trasformare me stesso. Voglio trasformare un popolo. Da debole a forte. Da diviso a unito. Da ospite mal sopportato a padrone del proprio destino. Da fuggiasco a protettore di chi fugge. Sono millecinquecento anni che scappiamo.

Ogni giorno la dottoressa Ellen Roth si scontra con un’umanità reietta, con la sofferenza più indicibile, con il buio della mente. Tuttavia, a questo caso non era preparata: la stanza numero 7 è satura di terrore, la paziente rannicchiata ai suoi piedi è stata picchiata, seviziata. È chiusa in se stessa, mugola parole senza senso. Dice che l’Uomo Nero la sta cercando. La sua voce è raccapricciante, è la voce di una bambina in un corpo di donna: le sussurra che adesso prenderà anche lei, Ellen, perché nessuno può sfuggire all’Uomo Nero. E quando il giorno dopo la paziente scompare dall’ospedale senza lasciare traccia, per Ellen incomincia l’incubo. Nessuno l’ha vista uscire, nessuno l’aveva vista entrare. Ellen la vuole rintracciare a tutti i costi ma viene coinvolta in un macabro gioco da cui non sa come uscire. Chi è quella donna? Cosa le è successo? E chi è veramente l’Uomo Nero?

Wyatt Davenport (Goodreads Author),Seth and Chloe,,English,,"Unique and distinct in setting and style, Lunara takes the reader on a space adventure set in our solar system. This full length novel (388 print pages) is a mix of action adventure and space opera. Earth is dead, destroyed by a barrage of meteors. What was left of the population has escaped to Mars and colonized it as humanities new home.Lunara, a small colony on Earth’s moon, is charged with catching and mining meteors for desperately needed minerals. But the deep-seated human thirst for domination is not easily defeated, nor is the capacity for deceit and betrayal. All it needs is a powerful catalyst, a prize valuable enough to risk plunging mankind into another destructive war. Parker McCloud and his friends, Seth and Chloe, are caught up in a violent series of events when Lunara is invaded. On Mars, Parker, Seth, Chloe, and the crew of the Protector attempt to sort out who is responsible, where the tide of suspicion swings back and forth between Aethpis and Zephyria. In the end, we see barbarism by the leaders of Mars, great courage by the crew of the Protector, and immense valor by the military on Lunara in adventure one in an exciting new series.Lunara Series BooksOriginal Trilogy:Lunara: Seth and ChloeLunara: Gwen and EamonnLunara: Parker and the Protector ",Lunara: The Original Trilogy #1,1 edition,05/01/11,May 20th 2011,[],Kindle Edition,"['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Amazon', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure']",,9780615481968,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328110491l/11759990.jpg,3.47,[],54.0,1.0,,11759990-seth-and-chloe,,,,,80.0,289.0,389,,Wyatt Davenport,"['62', '91', '78', '37', '21']",,,[],,

Władysław Stanisław Reymont,Chłopi,,Polish,,"Chłopi Władysława Reymonta to powieść opowiadająca o małej społeczności, zamieszkującej wieś Lipce. Utwór został podzielony na cztery części, którymi są pory roku, to one wyznaczają czas akcji. Powieść po raz pierwszy została opublikowana w druku w odcinkach w „Tygodniku Ilustrowanym” od 18 stycznia 1902 do 26 grudnia 1908. W formie książkowej utwór ukazywał się partiami – pierwsze dwa tomy zostały wydane w 1904 roku, tom trzeci w 1906, natomiast czwarty w 1909. Chłopi to powieść, w której dokonuje się mitologizacja chłopskiej egzystencji. Mieszkańcy Lipiec podporządkowani są dwóm porządkom czasowym – czasowi biologicznemu (czas zmian zachodzących w naturze) oraz czasowi obrzędowemu (kalendarz świąt kościelnych). Co ciekawe w utworze brak jednego, przewodniego wątku, ciągnącego się przez wszystkie tomy. Reymont prezentuje czytelnikowi losy wielu bohaterów, które przeplatają się ze sobą nawzajem.

Władysław Stanisław Reymont,Chłopi tom 1,,,,"Each of the four parts represents a season in the life of the peasants — Autumn (published in 1904), Winter (published in 1904), Spring (published in 1906), and Summer (published in 1909). This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature.Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel’s plot.In Chłopi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Chłopi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.",The Peasants (Chłopi) #1,,11/05/04,1982,[],,"['Nobel Prize', 'Poland', 'School', 'Classics', 'Polish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Read For School']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335948028l/13630723.jpg,3.22,[],95.0,1.0,,13630723-ch-opi-tom-1,,,,,69.0,554.0,365,,Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy,"['99', '138', '148', '124', '45']",,,[],,
"Władysław Szpilman, Anthea Bell (Translator)","The Pianist: The Extraordinary Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939–45",,,,"The last live broadcast on Polish Radio, on September 23, 1939, was Chopin's Nocturne in C# Minor, played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman, until his playing was interrupted by German shelling. It was the same piece and the same pianist, when broadcasting was resumed six years later. The Pianist is Szpilman's account of the years inbetween, of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself, related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman, now 88, has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi's If This Is A Man?; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse.  Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka, where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto, growing thinner and hungrier, yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp, but portions of his diary, reprinted here, tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed, thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946, but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3,500,000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240,000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --David Vincent",,,10/28/46,1999,"['Władysław Szpilman', 'Władysław Szpilman']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'War', 'Memoir', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Poland', 'Classics']",,9780575067080,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491050715l/128066.jpg,4.24,['Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize for Nonfiction (2000)'],757.0,12.0,,128066.The_Pianist,,,,,95.0,69514.0,222,,Victor Gollancz,"['34619', '22255', '8900', '2133', '1607']",,,['Warszawa (Poland)'],,
