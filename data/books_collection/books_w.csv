Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach’s demands and spend his summer baling hay?Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He’d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she’d received the phone call from Josh’s mother saying he’d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva’s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible.Cage isn’t real happy with his closet-sized bedroom in the back of a foul smelling barn, or his daily interactions with cows, but he knows that if he doesn’t make his coach happy then he can kiss his scholarship goodbye.

What is Numerology?,,[],"It should be known that human beings by nature have a concern and a strong desire to control the future as well as to seek to prevent loss of control. Mankind by nature, seeks order in a world or in an environment where that order may be threatened. Humans look for meaning in things. They look for a well-ordered system as well as patterns. Everything has divine coding that can slowly be unravelled through Numerology. Though it is permissible in Islam, crossing the limits is unacceptable. What is meant here by transgressing pass the boundaries is when numerologists delve into impermissible acts such as Astrology, Tarot reading, psychic reading, magic, and all those sciences and occultic acts that are completely impermissible in the revealed law. Just because the human hands have divine coding in them, it does not make palm reading permissible. Just because we all have star signs, it does not render horoscopic readings permissible. There is divine wisdom in the acts that are forbidden and even the acts that are permissible within the revealed law of Islam that step beyond the comprehension of the human intellect. If we follow this religious law, we will be safe and will not be imprisoned by the ego and desires, Satan and the world. We must be free from all this.

But ask what it means, and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have followed Niels Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation and dismissed questions about the reality underlying quantum physics as meaningless. A mishmash of solipsism and poor reasoning, Copenhagen endured, as Bohr's students vigorously protected his legacy, and the physics community favored practical experiments over philosophical arguments. As a result, questioning the status quo long meant professional ruin. And yet, from the 1920s to today, physicists like John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett persisted in seeking the true meaning of quantum mechanics.

Between Russia and Germany lay Poland, a nation that had only just recovered its independence after more than a century of foreign oppression. But it was economically and militarily weak and its misguided offensive to liberate the Ukraine in the spring of 1920 laid it open to attack. Egged on by Trotsky, Lenin launched a massive westward advance under the flamboyant Marshal Tukhachevsky. All that Great Britain and France had fought for over four years now seemed at risk. By the middle of August the Russians were only a few kilometers from Warsaw, and Berlin was less than a week's march away. Then the Miracle of the Vistula occurred: the Polish army led by Jozef Pilsudski regrouped and achieved one of the most decisive victories in military history. As a result, the Versailles peace settlement survived, and Lenin was forced to settle for Communism in one country. The battle for Warsaw bought Europe nearly two decades of peace, and communism remained a mainly Russian phenomenon, subsuming many of the autocratic and Byzantine characteristics of Russia's tsarist tradition.",,,01/01/08,February 4th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780007225521,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328834552l/2138623.jpg,3.78,[],96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,394.0,160,HarperPress,"['100', '143', '121', '26', '4']",,[],,['Adam Zamoyski']

Falling out of love is the hardest thing in the world.  And Elin and Ty Whitt are terrible at it.  The first time the local basketball star smiled at Elin, she was a goner. It was just so damn easy to fall for the dark-haired hometown hero with his charming smile and strong, athletic build.  Thousands of sleepy smiles, aimless drives down country roads, and squeaks of the backdoor after a swing shift later, reality hits. And it hits hard. Falling in love was definitely the easy part. Watching it break apart was impossible.  Through the tears, the second-guesses, the memories of a life built together, the world keeps spinning. With each turn comes clarity and hope—sometimes in the form of a pair of muddy boots by the back door or from the words of a wise friend.  When Ty shows back up with a new found determination to put his family back together, Elin's torn between the fights of the past and the possibility of a new start. This is the man that holds her heart, the man she loves beyond anything else. But this is also the one person in the world that can cause her the most pain.  Life’s not always easy. Love’s not for the faint of heart. But with life comes lessons and Ty and Elin have the scars to prove it.

Way to Go,,"['Fiction', 'Novels']","Death is everywhere in this odd novel, a coming-of-age story that dissolves into notes from a funeral business. First US publication for the Scottish Spence.Neil McGraw is a lad in Glasgow, an only child, the son of a dour undertaker permanently embittered by his wife's death during childbirth. Whenever the boy misbehaves, he's locked in the basement among the coffins, so it's not surprising he asks every body: What happens when you die? Against his will, he finds himself learning the trade. This is less gloomy than it sounds. The story moves at a good clip as the resilient Neil experiments with drinking and dating.The crisis comes when his dad finds him and his girl making out in a coffin. Soon, it's Neil's turn to lock his old man, dead drunk, into the basement, before hightailing it to the London of the Swinging '60s. A friendly queer, Abe Morris, offers him a crash pad, no strings attached, where Neil finds drugs, straight sex, and Zen. The party ends when Abe, stoned, is killed in traffic and Spence abandons conventional narrative to send Neil hopscotching around the world before depositing him, 15 years later, beside the funeral pyres of the Ganges. Here, he gets very sick but is rescued by a vision in a sari: Lila, a Londoner, back home for her father's funeral.

Wittgenstein's Vienna,,History,"This is a remarkable book about a man (perhaps the most important and original philosopher of our age), a society (the corrupt Austro-Hungarian Empire on the eve of dissolution), and a city (Vienna, with its fin-de siecle gaiety and corrosive melancholy). The central figure in this study of a crumbling society that gave birth to the modern world is Wittgenstein, the brilliant and gifted young thinker. With others, including Freud, Viktor Adler, and Arnold Schoenberg, he forged his ideas in a classical revolt against the stuffy, doomed, and moralistic lives of the old regime. As a portrait of Wittgenstein, the book is superbly realized; it is even better as a portrait of the age, with dazzling and unusual parallels to our own confused society. Allan Janik and Stephen Toulmin have acted on a striking premise: an understanding of prewar Vienna, Wittgenstein s native city, will make it easier to comprehend both his work and our own problems .This is an independent work containing much that is challenging, new, and useful.

"Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism",,"['Philosophy', 'Science', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'History', 'Faith', 'Atheism']","This book is a long-awaited major statement by a pre-eminent analytic philosopher, Alvin Plantinga, on one of our biggest debates -- the compatibility of science and religion. The last twenty years has seen a cottage industry of books on this divide, but with little consensus emerging. Plantinga, as a top philosopher but also a proponent of the rationality of religious belief, has a unique contribution to make. His theme in this short book is that the conflict between science and theistic religion is actually superficial, and that at a deeper level they are in concord.Plantinga examines where this conflict is supposed to exist -- evolution, evolutionary psychology, analysis of scripture, scientific study of religion -- as well as claims by Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Philip Kitcher that evolution and theistic belief cannot co-exist. Plantinga makes a case that their arguments are not only inconclusive but that the supposed conflicts themselves are superficial, due to the methodological naturalism used by science. On the other hand, science can actually offer support to theistic doctrines, and Plantinga uses the notion of biological and cosmological ""fine-tuning"" in support of this idea. Plantinga argues that we might think about arguments in science and religion in a new way -- as different forms of discourse that try to persuade people to look at questions from a perspective such that they can see that something is true. In this way, there is a deep and massive consonance between theism and the scientific enterprise.",,,11/06/11,December 9th 2011,"['Richard Dawkins', 'Sam Harris', 'Christopher Hitchens', 'Daniel Dennett']",Hardcover,,9780199812097,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347671777l/11289743.jpg,4.04,['Christianity Today Book Award (2013)'],56.0,1.0,,,,93.0,776.0,359,"Oxford University Press, USA","['301', '279', '140', '39', '17']",,[],,['Alvin Plantinga']

Why Women Fail,,[]," Something dreadful is happening to women.   Not directly to all women but to a sufficient number to affect nearly all women and indeed society as a whole.  This dreadful thing — for it is to be dreaded — is self-destructiveness, that strange process by which humans sometimes damage or destroy themselves in body, mind or spirit.  So writes Dr Ann Dally — doctor, psychiatrist and author.  In  The Morbid Streak  she showed how self-destructiveness distorts our lives and poisons our relationships.  Here, she painfully and compassionately explores a paradox.  Women are beginning to throw off the bonds of the last centuries, but as they emerge, the very freedoms and open choices they achieve thrust them brutally into underachievement, tranquillizer-addiction, neurosis, breakdown and even suicide.  And in our modern society, self-destruction in these forms equals failure.  So women’s personalities and the pressures of the new society conspire to cheat women of their ambitions, their self-esteem and their emotions.   Why Women Fail  is a fascinating study that does not only analyse the tragedy of women's constriction in society, but also shows how we can all work to restructure the values of society and enable women to achieve self-fulfilment.    Praise for Ann Dally     'Thorough and engaging' -  Kirkus Reviews   'introduces a levelheaded view' -  Kirkus Reviews   'refreshingly evenhanded' -  Kirkus Reviews     Dr Ann Dally (1929-2007)  was a pioneering English author and psychiatrist. She was born in London, the daughter of a distinguished lawyer and a half-American mother. She studied history, before qualifying in medicine and then in psychiatry, whilst going on to marry and have six children. Ann Dally wrote eleven books in all, including  Women Under the Knife , about the history of gynaecological surgery,  A-Z of Babies, The Intelligent Person’s Guide to Modern Medicine, A Child is Born, Mothers: Their Power and Influence  and  The Morbid Streak .

A cold case reopened -- and solved -- with dogged police work and new evidence. One of the shocking true crimes of passion and greed from Ann Rule's Crime Files.Former Marine sergeant and judo instructor Roland Pitre Jr. claimed it was all an elaborate plan to win back his wife's love -- it wasn't supposed to end with her dead body in the trunk of a car. Nearly twenty years later, he acknowledged that he had hired someone to kill his estranged wife in 1988, though his alleged excuse for why a monstrous ""mistake"" happened is as shocking and convoluted as the crime itself. Eventually, he was charged with first-degree murder in the long-unsolved death of Cheryl Pitre, after a mysterious witness betrayed Pitre to save his own skin.

Skillful prose makes the dishy profiles an engaging read .... A lively political book ....""Hillary Clinton couldn't have known how her husband’s high-profile philandering would play out. Would he be rehabilitated in the public eye? She took the gamble. Had she left the marriage, today she might be the spurned wife of a retired politician instead of the first American woman to head a major party ticket.Looking back on the path chosen by the nine political wives profiled in this book, we have the evidence to see a pattern—as old as the dynastic maneuverings of England’s medieval queens. The women married to the “royalty” of our times—politicians—make similar cold calculations in order to hold onto their “thrones” and their family’s history-making potential.After covering politicians for decades, acclaimed columnist Anne Michaud switched her gaze to the women behind the cheating men. Drawing from multiple sources that span the Roosevelts’ marriage to the more recent scandal involving Hillary Clinton’s closest aide Huma Abedin (wife of “sexter,” Anthony Weiner), ""Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Nine Political Wives"" argues that when it comes to the “power behind the throne,” women in the limelight weigh the risks and rewards. They remain loyal to their men, because of complex, often unconscious forces.From mapping a path to power to laudable notions of holding the family together, Michaud examines the uniquely challenging Faustian bargains that political wives grapple with, even as the public spotlight illuminates their every move.",,,,March 20th 2017,[],Paperback,,9780997663310,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486863758l/27015454._SX318_.jpg,4.4,[],1425.0,16.0,,,,98.0,1361.0,279,Oguquit-NY Press,"['683', '587', '58', '22', '11']",,[],,['Anne Michaud']

Anthony had a special feeling about Jonathan Larson's rock musical from his first audition, so he was thrilled when he landed a starring role as the filmmaker Mark Cohen. With his mom's cancer in remission and a reason to quit his newly acquired job at Starbucks, his life was looking up.  When Rent opened to thunderous acclaim off Broadway, Rapp and his fellow cast members knew that something truly extraordinary had taken shape.

Ward No. 6 and Other Stories,,Fiction,"Ward No. 6 and Other Stories, by Anton Chekhov, is part of theBarnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. Anton Chekhov invented the modern short story. With writing that is concise, realistic, and evocative, he became a sort of photographer in words, less interested in plot than in the subtleties of mood and atmosphere, and the telling detail. His characters, always vividly drawn, come from all walks of life and often seem to be caught up in a world they don''t quite understand. Early in his brief literary career, Chekhov outlined in a letter to his brother his idea of the ingredients of a good short story. Arguing against moral judgments and political, economic, or social commentary, he wrote, ""To describe . . . you need . . . to free yourself from the personal expression. . . . Subjectivity is a terrible thing."" Instead, he favored objectivity, truthfulness, originality, compassion, and brevity. Although his writing developed and matured, he remained largely faithful to these principles. This new selection of twenty-three stories explores the entire range of Chekhov''s short fiction, from early sketches, such as ""The Cook''s Wedding"" (1885) and ""On the Road"" (1886) to late works, such as ""In the Ravine"" (1900) and ""The Bishop"" (1902). Ward No. 6 and Other Stories includes some of his most popular tales, such as the title story and ""The Lady with the Dog"" (1899), as well as several lesser-known works, no less masterful in their composition. David Plante is a Professor of Writing at Columbia University. He is the author of many novels, including The Ghost of Henry James, The Family (nominated for the National Book Award), and The Woods. He has been a contributor to The New Yorker, Esquire, and Vogue, and a reviewer and features writer for the New York Times Book Review.",,,,2003.0,,,1593080034,9781593080037,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w4lxIoUjQdsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.32,,,,,,,,,400.0,,,6805.0,,,['Anton Pavlovich Chekhov']

Waltz With Bashir: A Lebanon War Story,,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Israel', 'Memoir', 'Lebanon', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Biography']","""Special, strange, and peculiarly potent... Extraordinary."" —Variety One night in Beirut in September 1982, while Israeli soldiers secured the area, Christian militia members entered the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila and began to massacre hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians. Ari Folman was one of those Israeli soldiers, but for more than twenty years he remembered nothing of that night or of the weeks leading up to it. Then came a friend's disturbing dream, and with it Folman's need to excavate the truth of the war in Lebanon and answer the crucial question: what was he doing during the hours of slaughter? Challenging the collective amnesia of friends and fellow soldiers, Folman painfully, candidly pieces together the war and his place in it. Gradually, the blankness of his mind is filled in by scenes of combat and patrol, misery and carnage, as well as dreams and hallucinations. Soldiers are haunted by inexplicable nightmares and flashbacks - snapping, growling dogs with teeth bared and eyes glowing orange; a recurring image of three young men rising naked out of the sea to drift into the Beirut battlefield. Tanks crush cars and buildings with lethal indifference; snipers pick off men on donkeys, men in cars, men drinking coffee; a soldier waltzes through a storm of bullets; rock songs fill the air, and then yellow flares. The recollections accumulate until Ari Folman arrives at Sabra and Shatila and his investigation reaches its terrible end. The result is a gripping reconstruction, a probing inquiry into the unreliable quality of memory, and, above all, a powerful denunciation of the senselessness of all wars. Profoundly original in form and approach, Waltz with Bashir will take its place as one of the great works of wartime testimony.",,,2008,February 17th 2009,[],Paperback,,9780805088922,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312051099l/3345720.jpg,3.93,[],21.0,1.0,,,,95.0,1960.0,128,Metropolitan Books,"['569', '804', '489', '81', '17']",,['Beirut (Lebanon)'],,"['Ari Folman', 'David Polonsky']"

"Whirlwind: The Air War Against Japan, 1942-1945",,"['History', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'Aviation', 'Military History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Japan', 'Asia', 'American']","WHIRLWIND is the first book to tell the complete, awe-inspiring story of the Allied air war against Japan--the most important strategic bombing campaign inhistory. From the audacious Doolittle raid in 1942 to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, award-winning historian Barrett Tillman recounts the saga from the perspectives of American and British aircrews who flew unprecedented missions overthousands of miles of ocean, as well as of the generalsand admirals who commanded them.Whether describing the experiences of bomber crews based in China or the Marianas, fighter pilotson Iwo Jima, or carrier aviators at sea, Tillman provides vivid details of the lives of the fliers and their support personnel. ""Whirlwind"" takes readers into the cockpits and gun turrets of the mighty B-29 Superfortress, the largest bomber built up to that time. Tillman dramatically re-creates the sweep of wartime emotions that crews endured on fifteen-hour missions, grappling with the extreme tedium of cramped spaces and with adrenaline spikes in flak-studded skies, knowing that a bailout would put them at the mercy of a merciless enemy or an unforgiving sea.A major character is the controversial and brilliant General Curtis LeMay, who rewrote strategic bombing tactics. His command's fire-bombing missions incinerated fully half of Tokyo and many other cities, crippling Japan's industry while still failing to force surrender.""Whirlwind"" examines the immense logistics and construction efforts necessary to support Superfortresses in Asia and the Mariana Islands, as well as the tireless efforts of engineers to build huge air bases from scratch.It also describes the unheralded missions that American bomber crews flew from the Aleutian Islands to Japan's northernmost Kuril Islands.Never has the Japanese side of the story been so thoroughly examined. If Washington, D.C., represented a ""second front"" in Army-Navy rivalry, the situation in Tokyo approached a full-contact sport. Tillman's description of Japan's willfully inadequate approach to civil defense is eye-opening. Similarly, he examines the mind-set in Tokyo's war cabinet, which ignored the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, requiring the emperor's personal intervention to avert a ghastly Allied invasion.Tillman shows how, despite the Allies' ultimate success, mistakes and shortsighted policies made victory more costly in lives and effort. He faults the lack of a unified command for allowing the Army Air Forces and the Navy to pursue parochial goals at the expense of the larger mission, and he questions the premature commitment of the enormously sophisticated B-29 to the most primitive theater in India and China.""Whirlwind"" is one of the last histories of World War II written with the contribution of men who fought in it.With unexcelled macro- and microperspectives, ""Whirlwind"" is destined to become a standard reference on the war, on multiservice operations, and on the human capacity for individual heroism and national folly.",,,,March 2nd 2010,[],Hardcover,,9781416584407,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461010277l/7524258._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],92.0,1.0,,,,94.0,510.0,336,Simon & Schuster,"['143', '211', '124', '26', '6']",,[],,['Barrett Tillman']

Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution it Inspired,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Church History', 'Christianity', 'British Literature', 'Biography', 'Books About Books', 'Reference', 'Historical']","Next to the Bible itself, the English Bible was-and is-the most influential book ever published. The most famous of all English Bibles, the King James Version was the culmination of centuries of work by various translators, from John Wycliffe, the fourteenth-century initiator of English Bible translation, to the committee of scholars who collaborated on the King James translation. ""Wide as the Waters"" examines the life and work of Wycliffe and recounts the tribulations of his successors, including William Tyndale, who was martyred, Miles Coverdale, and others who came to bitter ends, as well as the fifty-four scholars from Oxford and Cambridge who crafted the King James Version of the Bible.  Historian Benson Bobrick traces this story through the tumultuous reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary Tudor, and Elizabeth I, a time of fierce contest between Catholics and Protestants in England.  Once people were free to interpret the word of God, they began to question the authority of their inherited institutions, both religious and secular. This led to reformation within the Church, and to the rise of constitutional government in England and the end of the divine right of kings.  ""Wide as the Waters"" is a story about a crucial epoch in the development of Christianity, about the English language and society, and about a book that changed the course of history.  ""Bobrick is an exceptionally able writer of popular histories. . . . This new book is by far his most ambitious. . . . He succeeds entirely in the challenge he sets himself.""

Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects,,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Atheism', 'Essays', 'Classics', 'Science', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Spirituality']","Dedicated as few men have been to the life of reason, Bertrand Russell has always been concerned with the basic questions to which religion also addresses itself -- questions about man's place in the universe and the nature of the good life, questions that involve life after death, morality, freedom, education, and sexual ethics. He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire.  ""I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,"" Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954.  The book has been edited, with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix, Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial ""Bertrand Russell Case"" of 1940, in which Russell was judicially declared ""unfit"" to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York.  Whether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand Russell's views, he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions, a masterly statement of a philosophical position, and a pure joy to read.",,,05/28/57,October 30th 1967,[],Paperback,,9780671203238,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347925703l/472025.jpg,4.02,[],556.0,7.0,,,,92.0,18449.0,266,Touchstone,"['6906', '6845', '3312', '916', '470']",,[],,"['Bertrand Russell', 'Paul Edwards']"

Not illustrated. Excerpt: Desirees Baby is a short story written by American author Kate Chopin about miscegenation in Creole Louisiana during the antebellum period. Desiree is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmonde, who are wealthy Creoles in Louisiana. As a baby, she was discovered by Monsieur Valmonde lying in the shadow of a stone pillar near the Valmonde gateway. She is courted by another wealthy scion of a Creole family, Armand. They appear very devoted to one another and eventually have a child. The people who see the baby get a sense that something is unusual about it. Eventually they realize that the baby's skin is the same color as the quadroon (one-quarter African) nursemaid - the baby is not white. At the time of the story, this would have been considered a terrible taint. Because of Desirees unknown origins, Armand immediately assumes that she is part Black, and after Madame Valmonde suggests that Desiree and the baby return to the Valmonde estate, Armand tells her to leave. Desiree then takes the child and walks off into a bayou where she is never seen again. Armand then proceeds to burn all of Desirees belongings and the childs cradle, as well as all of the letters that she had sent him during their courtship. With this bundle of letters is also one written from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is in fact the one who is part black. Desiree's race is never definitively determined, although after she is dismissed: ""Moreover no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.""

Wandering Feelings,,[],"There is a certain line of destiny for each one of us, which seems as if no one and nothing could ever change. Is that really so, however? Perhaps, some people would disagree. These are the people that will always believe that it may be changed because it is like a strip of sand, which remains after the tide at the seashore and is different every time. Part of those people is this couple – two young companions, who can still love and have their dreams. They are gazing at the profound essence of the world’s earthly, human time as well as the one of eternity within them, the heart one. A criss-cross of interweaving roads leads them far away but only a single one brings them back home.

Why Does E=mc²? (And Why Should We Care?),,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Popular Science', 'Mathematics', 'Astronomy', 'Audiobook', 'Space', 'Reference', 'Unfinished']","The most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today’s leading scientists.Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up Einstein’s most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine—which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang—Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.Alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed.

What makes them run?This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.",,,10/29/41,May 7th 2002,['Sammy Glick'],Hardcover,,9780375508318,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171476932l/101191.jpg,4.09,[],195.0,2.0,,,,96.0,2122.0,320,Random House,"['750', '909', '382', '63', '18']",,[],,['Budd Schulberg']

That is the question at the heart of We Should All Be Feminists, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun. With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike.

Book Four in the New York Times Wild Seasons series that began with Sweet Filthy Boy (the Romantic Times book of the year that Sylvia Day called “a sexy, sweet treasure of a story”), Dirty Rowdy Thing, and Dark Wild Night.For two people ambivalent about dating and love, they sure get naked around each other an awful lot . . .

For his part, Luke’s been on hookup autopilot for so long that he rarely ever pauses to consider what he’s doing. But after an amazing time with London, he realizes that he hasn’t been moving on from a devastating heartbreak so much as he’s been drifting to wherever—and whomever—the current takes him. With London he wants more.  Every relationship involves two people…plus their pasts. And as much as she enjoys her fling with Luke, when London learns about his past—more specifically, who’s in it—everything becomes the brand of complicated she strives to avoid.

You must protect it. —Diana, Princess of Wales Theirs was destined from the start to be one of the most celebrated unions of the twenty-first century: he, the charismatic prince who would someday be crowned king of England; she, the stunningly beautiful commoner who won his heart. Prince William and Kate Middleton defied all odds to forge a storybook romance amid the scandals, power struggles, tragedies, and general dysfunction that are the hallmarks of Britain’s Royal Family. In the process, they became the most written about, gossiped about, admired, and envied young couple of their generation.Yet for most of their nearly decade-long affair, William and Kate have remained famously quiet and kept their royal relationship a tantalizing mystery. Now, as their long-anticipated wedding finally approaches, journalist and #1 New York Times bestselling author Christopher Andersen reveals the intimate details of their celebrated courtship and offers a mesmerizing glimpse of the man and wife—and future king and queen—they will become:· William’s lifelong role as confidant and adviser to his fragile mother, and how it has shaped his relationship with Kate· The lengths the couple went to to keep their affair secret, from their first days together as university students (when he cheered her on as she modeled racy lingerie at a fashion show)· William’s romantic conquests before—and during—his decade-long romance with Kate· The person who was really behind their headlinemaking breakup—and how Kate won back her prince· The shocking sex-and-drugs scandals involving Kate’s wild relatives, and how the would-be queen survived them· The long-troubling influence of William’s substance-abusing aristocrat friends and the depression Kate rescued him from· Stunning new information on the threats to both their lives, the nightmare scenario that haunts William’s dreams to this day, and their narrow escape from repeating Diana’s fate· Surprising details on the Queen’s historic plans for William and Kate, which will forever change the face of the monarchyFor many, William and Kate’s union represents an opportunity to recapture the magic—the compelling and complicated legacy—of his beloved mother Diana, Princess of Wales. Part glittering fairy tale, part searing family drama, part political potboiler, part heart-stopping cliff-hanger, theirs is, above all else, an affair to remember. *** Theirs is the story of two young people who found each other in college, came perilously close to losing what they had forever, and pulled back from the brink at the last possible moment. Theirs is the story of private moments stolen for public consumption, of harrowing car chases, of scorching personal dramas played out behind the scenes, of calm heads prevailing in times of panic, and of a singular devotion made stronger by time.The saga of William and Kate is one thing above all else: a love story.—From William and Kate: A Royal Love Story",,,12/15/10,December 21st 2010,[],Hardcover,,9781451621457,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438798174l/9817513._SY475_.jpg,3.58,[],56.0,1.0,,,,86.0,1371.0,312,Gallery Books,"['311', '406', '460', '158', '36']",,[],,['Christopher Andersen']

Lee relinquished his sword, a band of Union and Confederate veterans dusted off their guns. But these former foes had no intention of reigniting the Civil War. Instead, they were bound by a common goal: to seize the British province of Canada and to hold it hostage until the independence of Ireland was secured.By the time that these invasions--known together as the Fenian Raids--began in 1866, Ireland had been Britain's unwilling colony for seven hundred years. Thousands of Civil War veterans considered themselves Irishmen before they were Americans. They were those who fled rather than perish in the wake of the Great Hunger, and now they took their cue from a previous generation of successful American revolutionaries. With the tacit support of the U.S. government, the Fenian Brotherhood established a state in exile, planned prison breaks, weathered infighting, stockpiled weapons, and assassinated enemies. Defiantly, this motley group, including a one-armed war hero, an English spy infiltrating rebel forces, and a radical who staged his own funeral, managed to seize a piece of Canada--if only for three days.When the Irish Invaded Canada is the untold tale of a band of fiercely patriotic Irish Americans and their chapter in Ireland's centuries-long fight for independence.

Or has Buddhism become too detached, so still and quiet that the Buddha has fallen asleep? Waking the Buddha tells the story of the Soka Gakkai International, the largest, most dynamic Buddhist movement in the world today—and one that is waking up and shaking up Buddhism so it can truly work in ordinary people’s lives. Drawing on his long personal experience as a Buddhist teacher, journalist, and editor, Clark Strand offers broad insight into how and why the Soka Gakkai, with its commitment to social justice and its egalitarian approach, has become a role model, not only for other schools of Buddhism, but for other religions as well. Readers will be inspired by the struggles and triumphs of the Soka Gakkai’s three founding presidents—individuals who staked their lives on the teachings of the Lotus Sutra and the extraordinary power of those teachings to help people become happy.",,,January 1st 2014,May 1st 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,9780977924561,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399993736l/22079771.jpg,4.05,[],31.0,1.0,,,,90.0,284.0,193,Middleway Press,"['126', '82', '47', '23', '6']",,[],,['Clark Strand']

After suffering decades of neglect from the children who've forgotten him, Winkie summons the courage to take charge of his fate, and so he hops off the shelf, jumps out the window, and takes to the forest. But just as he is discovering the joys and wonders of mobility, Winkie gets trapped in the jaws of a society gone rabid with fear and paranoia. Having come upon the cabin of the mad professor who stole his beloved, Winkie is suddenly surrounded by the FBI, who instantly conclude that he is the evil mastermind behind dozens of terrorist attacks that have been traced to the forest. Terrified and confused, Winkie is brought to trial, where the prosecution attempts to seal the little bear’s fate by interviewing witnesses from the trials of Galileo, Socrates, John Scopes, and Oscar Wilde. Emotionally gripping and intellectually compelling, Winkie exposes the absurdities of our age and explores what it means to be human in an increasingly barbaric world.",,,11/06/06,June 10th 2007,[],Paperback,,9780802143105,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328856911l/801998.jpg,3.06,[],80.0,1.0,,,,68.0,1800.0,256,Grove Press,"['243', '422', '551', '373', '211']",,[],,['Clifford Chase']

Danny's mother lost her five-year battle with cancer three weeks before his graduation-the one day that she was hanging on to see.Now Danny is left alone, with only his memories, his dog, and his heart-breaking ex-girlfriend for company. He doesn't know how to figure out what to do with her estate, what to say for his Valedictorian speech, let alone how to live or be happy anymore.When he gets a letter from his mom's property manager in Tokyo, where she had been going for treatment, it shows a side of his mother he never knew. So, with no other sense of direction, Danny travels to Tokyo to connect with his mother's memory and make sense of her final months, which seemed filled with more joy than Danny ever knew. There, among the cherry blossoms, temples, and crowds, and with the help of an almost-but-definitely-not Harajuku girl, he begins to see how it may not have been ancient magic or mystical treatment that kept his mother going.

"Woody Notes, and Heat Sneaking up Fast",,[],"Danny Winter is a student of the human condition, and in this book, he does what he does best; write poems with passion and pizazz. What can I tell you about Danny? He has a ferocious spirit and vigour. He has high moods and an instinctive ability to perceive and understand the world around him. He has a fierce sense of loyalty, he’s romantic, quixotic and starry-eyed, all of which is a gift from his Gypsy heritage. These are all talents, of course, which have given Gypsies a lot of survival skills to match their really dark sense of humour.But Danny also brings smiles to everyone he meets, a gift I truly believe comes from a higher source. There is no denying, however, that at times he can be restless, carrying the capacity for vastly darker moods, melancholy energies and occasional bouts of madness. Writers, poets, artists, musicians and circus clowns often suffer from boisterous and raucous dispositions. And it’s true they can get into trouble at times. They wear their moods as their ships of passage, and Danny is no different. He suffers from what Lord Byron would term a “fine madness.” He throws out poems in a sparkle of energy. And he puts everything into the words. They just arrive on paper as though a higher being is working through him. I can’t explain this, but it’s how it happensI’ve known Danny for over 40 years, since we shared a room together at a seaside town in the South coast of England. So my opinion? He’s probably a bit of a mad genius, although he loves the world and everyone in it, and if just one person enjoys this book then Danny will sleep with a smile on his face tonight. Danny is a stargazer who tells fortunes with his poetry,As we publish this book we’re right in the middle of a pandemic, but we’ll get over it. It’s just another crisis. And Danny has written several poems on this subject, some of which are actually very funny. And in the book you’ll also find poems on a variety of subjects; England, football, religion, Alzheimer’s, alcoholism, drug abuse, homelessness, ageing, the love of pets, the military, boxers, kindness and, of course, Gypsies and Travellers.

"Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty",,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Political Science', 'Sociology', 'Society', 'Science', 'Social Science']","Brilliant and engagingly written, Why Nations Fail answers the question that has stumped the experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and others poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food and famine? Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including:    - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West?    - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority?    - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?

Although deeply influenced by Einstein, he was also, more unusually for a scientist, inspired by mysticism. Indeed, in the 1970s and 1980s he made contact with both J.

In both science and philosophy, Bohm's main concern was with understanding the nature of reality in general and of consciousness in particular.

Wittgenstein's Poker,The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,Philosophy,"On October 25, 1946, in a crowded room in Cambridge, England, the great twentieth-century philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper came face to face for the first and only time. The meeting -- which lasted ten minutes -- did not go well. Their loud and aggressive confrontation became the stuff of instant legend, but precisely what happened during that brief confrontation remained for decades the subject of intense disagreement. An engaging mix of philosophy, history, biography, and literary detection, Wittgenstein's Poker explores, through the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation, the history of philosophy in the twentieth century. It evokes the tumult of fin-de-siécle Vienna, Wittgentein's and Popper's birthplace; the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Austria; and postwar Cambridge University, with its eccentric set of philosophy dons, including Bertrand Russell.

Washington's Crossing,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'American Revolution', 'Military History', 'War', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Biography', 'Presidents', 'Military Fiction']","Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia.Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined.Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning.",,,12/01/03,February 12th 2004,[],Hardcover,,0000195170342,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353284022l/1206073.jpg,4.13,"['Pulitzer Prize for History (2005)', 'Ambassador Book Award for American Studies (2005)', 'Massachusetts Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2005)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2004)']",154.0,2.0,,,,93.0,13711.0,564,"Oxford University Press, USA","['6136', '4396', '2255', '638', '286']",,[],,['David Hackett Fischer']

How he avoids capture & ultimately escapes--revealing that much spoils nothing in this white-knuckle narrative--is astonishing stuff.

When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler,,"['History', 'Military History', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Russia', 'War', 'Germany', 'European History', 'Soviet Union']","On first publication, this uncommonly concise and readable account of Soviet Russia's clash with Nazi Germany utterly changed our understanding of World War II on Germany's Eastern Front, immediately earning its place among top-shelf histories of the world war. Revised and updated to reflect recent Russian and Western scholarship on the subject, much of it the authors' own work, this new edition maintains the 1995 original's distinction as a crucial volume in the history of World War II and of the Soviet Union and the most informed and compelling perspective on one of the greatest military confrontations of all time.In 1941, when Pearl Harbor shattered America's peacetime pretensions, the German blitzkrieg had already blasted the Red Army back to Moscow. Yet, less than four years later, the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flew above the ruins of Berlin, stark symbol of a miraculous comeback that destroyed the Germany Army and put an end to Hitler's imperial designs. In swift and stirring prose, When Titans Clash provides the clearest, most complete account of this epic struggle, especially from the Soviet perspective. Drawing on the massive and unprecedented release of Soviet archival documents in recent decades, David Glantz, one of the world's foremost authorities on the Soviet military, and noted military historian Jonathan House expand and elaborate our picture of the Soviet war effort - a picture sharply different from accounts that emphasize Hitler's failed leadership over Soviet strategy and might.Rafts of newly available official directives, orders, and reports reveal the true nature and extraordinary scale of Soviet military operations as they swept across the one thousand miles from Moscow to Berlin, featuring stubborn defenses and monumental offensives and counteroffensives and ultimately costing the two sides combined a staggering twenty million casualties. Placing the war within its wider context, the authors also make use of recent revelations to clarify further the political, economic, and social issues that influenced and reflected what happened on the battlefield. Their work gives us new insight into Stalin's political motivation and Adolf Hitler's role as warlord, as well as a better understanding of the human and economic costs of the war - for both the Soviet Union and Germany.While incorporating a wealth of new information, When Titans Clashed remains remarkably compact, a tribute to the authors' determination to make this critical chapter in world history as accessible as it is essential.",,Revised and expanded edition,,October 16th 2015,[],Paperback,,9780700621217,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456692968l/27191159._SY475_.jpg,4.14,['Arthur Goodzeit Book Award (1996)'],90.0,1.0,,,,96.0,876.0,568,University Press of Kansas,"['342', '353', '146', '28', '7']",,[],,"['David M.

The son of an Italian immigrant butcher, Lombardi toiled for twenty frustrating years as a high school coach and then as an assistant at Fordham, West Point, and the New York Giants before his big break came at age forty-six with the chance to coach a struggling team in snowbound Wisconsin. His leadership of the Green Bay Packers to five world championships in nine seasons is the most storied period in NFL history. Lombardi became a living legend, a symbol to many of leadership, discipline, perseverance, and teamwork, and to others of an obsession with winning.

Wind Rider's Oath,,Fiction,"Bahzell of the Hradani is Back! Exciting Fantasy Adventure by the New York Times Best-Selling Author of the Honor Harrington Series. First Time in Paperback. In The War God's Own, Bahzell had managed to stop a war by convincing Baron Tellian, leader of the Sothoii, to ""surrender"" to him, the War God's champion. Now, he has journeyed to the Sothoii Wind Plain to oversee the parole he granted to Tellian and his men, to represent the Order of Tomanak, the War God, and to be an ambassador for the hradani. What's more, the flying coursers of the Sothoii have accepted Bahzell as a wind rider-the first hradani wind rider in history. And since the wind riders are the elite of the elite among the Sothoii, Bahzell's ascension is as likely to stir resentment as respect. That combination of duties would have been enough to keep anyone busy-even a warrior prince like Bahzell-but additional complications are bubbling under the surface. The goddess Shigu, the Queen of Hell, is sowing dissension among the war maids of the Sothoii. The supporters of the deposed Sothoii noble who started the war are plotting to murder their new leige lord and frame Bahzell for the deed. Of course, those problems are all in a day's work for a champion of the War God. But what is Bahzell going to do about the fact that Baron Tellian's daughter, and heir to the realm, seems to be thinking that he is the only man-or hradani-for her?",,,,2005.0,,,1416508953,9781416508953,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DjVIPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.02,,,,,,,,,570.0,,,2714.0,,,['David Weber']

Why Women Should Rule the World,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Womens', 'Feminism', 'Politics', 'Leadership', 'Business', 'History', 'Book Club', 'The United States Of America']","What would happen if women ruled the world?Everything could change, according to former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers. Politics would be more collegial. Businesses would be more productive. And communities would be healthier. Empowering women would make the world a better place—not because women are the same as men, but precisely because they are different.Blending memoir, social history, and a call to action, Dee Dee Myers challenges us to imagine a not-too-distant future in which increasing numbers of women reach the top ranks of politics, business, science, and academia.Reflecting on her own tenure in the Clinton administration and her work as a political analyst, media commentator, and former consultant to NBC's The West Wing, Myers assesses the crucial but long-ignored strengths that female leaders bring to the table. ""Women tend to be better communicators, better listeners, better at forming consensus,"" Myers argues. In a highly competitive and increasingly fractious world, women possess the kind of critical problem-solving skills that are urgently needed to break down barriers, build understanding, and create the best conditions for peace.Myers knows firsthand the responsibilities and rewards of taking on leadership roles traditionally occupied by men. At thirty-one, she was appointed White House press secretary to President Bill Clinton—the first woman ever to hold the job. In a candid look at her years in Washington's political spotlight, she recalls the day-to-day challenge of confronting a press corps obsessed with more than just the president's policies.

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

But when the evil Mayor of Manchester (formerly Bludchester) redoubles his efforts to rid Sang of the Bludmen once and for all, stealing Tish’s locket in hopes of traveling back to her world himself for reinforcements, Criminy and Tish must battle ghosts, sea monsters, wayward submarines, a secret cabal, and thundering Bludmares to get the locket back and allow Tish to return home…but has she found love with Criminy?

Most of us would say we love to learn, but we hated school. Why is that? What happens to creativity and individuality as we pass through the educational system?Walking on Water is a startling and provocative look at teaching, writing, creativity, and life by a writer increasingly recognized for his passionate and articulate critique of modern civilization. This time Derrick Jensen brings us into his classroom--whether college or maximum security prison--where he teaches writing. He reveals how schools perpetuate the great illusion that happiness lies outside of ourselves and that learning to please and submit to those in power makes us into lifelong clock-watchers. As a writing teacher Jensen guides his students out of the confines of traditional education to find their own voices, freedom, and creativity.Jensen's great gift as a teacher and writer is to bring us fully alive at the same moment he is making us confront our losses and count our defeats. It is at the center of Walking on Water, a book that is not only a hard-hitting and sometimes scathing critique of our current educational system and not only a hands-on method for learning how to write, but, like Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way, a lesson on how to connect to the core of our creative selves, to the miracle of waking up and arriving breathless (but with dry feet) on the far shore.",,,,April 28th 2005,[],Paperback,,9781931498784,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390169646l/60974.jpg,4.19,[],99.0,1.0,,,,95.0,1130.0,216,Chelsea Green Publishing Company,"['521', '379', '172', '42', '16']",,[],,['Derrick Jensen']

Derrick Jensen and George Draffan are taking down the data mining industry, one converted mind at a time. In the face of RFID chips, consumer tracking strategies, and illegal government wiretapping, Jensen and Draffan are determined to show consumers how to fight back against government and industry to regain their rights, their privacy, and their humanity. In their new book, Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control, Jensen and Draffan take a hart-hitting look at the way technology is used as a machine, to control us and our environment. Their results are startling.If the prospect of perpetual surveillance and psychological warfare alarms you, you are not alone. Most people would be disturbed if you told them that everything from their store purchases to their public transit rides are recorded and filed for government or corporate access. But more often than not, the smooth, silent cleanliness of its operation allows the Machine of Western Civilization to go unnoticed. In Welcome to the Machine, Jensen and Draffan draw our attention back to its eerie, persistent white noise and take a cold, hard, human look at the cultural conditions that have led us to all but surrender to its hum.Jensen and Draffan, who teamed up in 2003 to expose industrial corruption and destruction in Strangely Like War: The Global Assault on Forests, are back to reveal both the terrifying extent of surveillance today and our chilling complacency at the loss of everything from consumer privacy to civil liberties. In this timely and important new collaboration, Jensen and Draffan take on all aspects of Control Culture: everything from the government's policy of total information awareness to a disturbing new technology where soldiers can be given medication to prevent them from feeling fear.

Situated in Ohio, this idyllic retreat is particularly nice in the summer when the Southern humidity is too much to bear. The main building, with its luxurious finishes, is loftier than the white cottages that flank it, but then again, the smaller structures are better positioned to catch any breeze that may come off the pond.

It's their open secret.Lizzie, Reenie, and Sweet are regulars at Tawawa House. They have become friends over the years as they reunite and share developments in their own lives and on their respective plantations. They don't bother too much with questions of freedom, though the resort is situated in free territory–but when truth-telling Mawu comes to the resort and starts talking of running away, things change.To run is to leave behind everything these women value most–friends and families still down South–and for some it also means escaping from the emotional and psychological bonds that bind them to their masters. When a fire on the resort sets off a string of tragedies, the women of Tawawa House soon learn that triumph and dehumanization are inseparable and that love exists even in the most inhuman, brutal of circumstances–all while they are bearing witness to the end of an era.An engaging, page-turning, and wholly original novel, Wench explores, with an unflinching eye, the moral complexities of slavery.",,,12/16/09,January 5th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780061706547,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348551327l/6751356.jpg,3.7,"['Black Caucus of the American Library Association Literary Award for 1st Novelist (2011)', 'Hurston/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Fiction (2011)']",96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,15457.0,290,Amistad,"['2970', '6452', '4730', '1089', '216']",,['Ohio (United States)'],,['Dolen Perkins-Valdez']

When Angels Rest,,['Fiction'],"During World War II, real news is a rare commodity in the hamlet of Stay More, Arkansas. But twelve-year-old Dawny - inspired by his hero Ernie Pyle - finds enough local color to keep the townsfolk reading his weekly newspaper, The Stay Morning Star. Dawny reports on the war between the Allies and the Axis, two roving bands of boys and girls fighting with sticks and spears, and competing in scrap drives and verbal jousts. But the tenor of these games changes as developments bring the world's war closer to home: the crackle of the town's first radio delivers frightening news from the outside world to the isolated village, and a native son dies on Iwo Jima. For the first time ever, an airplane darkens the skies over Stay More, and soldiers occupy the remote hills in training for an invasion of Japan. As the ways of outsiders creep into the small town's routines, the texture of rural life is irrevocably changed. Donald Harington's bittersweet tale reflects on the hilarity and calamity of childhood, the isolation that remains in intimacy, and the impending shadows of maturity that darken human nature. By turns comic, sad, and violent, When Angels Rest is a masterful work, part American tall tale, part hillbilly paradise.",Stay More #8,,11/06/98,August 1st 2005,[],Paperback,,9781592641048,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347466362l/563787.jpg,3.87,[],81.0,1.0,,,,96.0,119.0,268,Toby Press,"['26', '57', '31', '4', '1']",,[],,['Donald Harington']

"We Goddesses: Athena, Aphrodite, Hera",,"['Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Picture Books', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult', 'Greek Mythology']","In ""life"" they hardly got along, but their book is a triumph of witty, robust, spell-casting collaboration. The Greek myths have never before been told by their leading ladies. Nor ever before in such a charming, conversational yet dramatic and modern way. The tellings of Athena, Aphrodite, and Hera intertwine (though none repeats a myth), enabling us to hear more than one perspective on events and motives -- say, for instance, their wrangle over the golden apple and the outbreak of the Trojan War. And the cast of Olympian, mortal, and animal characters is unforgettable, as it has been since the times of Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, and Ovid, whose originals are the author's first sources here. Miraculous births, triumphs and sorrows in love, spats and adventures are all given a personal vividness, the voice of each goddess being distinctly her own. An introduction in the author's voice casts light on the Greeks' sense of right and wrong, and on their attitudes toward the social/political position of women (debased on earth, exalted on high), as well as explaining how children helped in the shaping of this book. In an Epilogue/Afterword, the goddesses personally invite readers to Olympus to choose among them as the young shepherd Paris had to. But now, their rivalries stilled, a sense of sisterhood prevails. Opulent original paintings adorn their tellings; back-matter pages of sculptures, vases, and friezes show how Classical artists imagined the goddesses, whose selves have proved to be deservedly immortal.",,,11/06/99,May 18th 2000,[],Hardcover,,9780751372229,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1187498479l/1729818._SX318_.jpg,4.16,[],87.0,1.0,,,,93.0,110.0,144,Doris Orgel,"['54', '31', '17', '5', '3']",,[],,"['Doris Orgel', 'Marilee Heyer']"

Ever since she can remember, Sonia has had to abide by her parents' ridiculously unfair rules like not being allowed to date or even kiss a guy. The only reason she thinks she's being held to these rules is when Sonia was eight, she took a sip of her friend’s drink, causing her friend to do everything Sonia asked. As her eighteenth birthday approaches, Sonia is finally about to learn why; she's a Huldra, a dangerous, yet seductive and magical Norse forest maiden who with just one kiss, has the ability to control humans and appropriate parts of their souls. Keeping the rules hasn't been a problem for Sonia because she's never really been attracted to any guy. But when Anthony transfers to her school, every last rule flies out the window. There's just something about Anthony that she can't resist—the way he seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret that is connected to her, the way his mysterious blue eyes cause her heart to beat more rapidly, his athletic, god-like physique. The closer she gets to her eighteenth birthday—the moment she matures into a fully realized Huldra—the harder it becomes to follow her parents' rules. As graduation day approaches, Anthony starts to show interest in her, but she would never have guessed how life-changing and how dangerous Anthony's secrets are, and how overwhelmingly intense a relationship with him could be.

Her new novel, We Are All Welcome Here, features three women, each struggling against overwhelming odds for her own kind of freedom.It is the summer of 1964. In Tupelo, Mississippi, the town of Elvis's birth, tensions are mounting over civil-rights demonstrations occurring ever more frequently-and violently-across the state. But in Paige Dunn's small, ramshackle house, there are more immediate concerns. Challenged by the effects of the polio she contracted during her last month of pregnancy, Paige is nonetheless determined to live as normal a life as possible and to raise her daughter, Diana, in the way she sees fit-with the support of her tough-talking black caregiver, Peacie.Diana is trying in her own fashion to live a normal life. As a fourteen-year-old, she wants to make money for clothes and magazines, to slough off the authority of her mother and Peacie, to figure out the puzzle that is boys, and to escape the oppressiveness she sees everywhere in her small town. What she can never escape, however, is the way her life is markedly different from others'. Nor can she escape her ongoing responsibility to assist in caring for her mother.

The narrative traces the development of the two girls into womanhood within the gossiping and watchful society of Hollingford.Wives and Daughters is far more than a nostalgic evocation of village life; it offers an ironic critique of mid-Victorian society.

The Scottish Highlands are well known for their mystical charms and tales of fantasy, yet very few have encountered the power of a Highland Stag, the magic of a Campbell crystal or the enchantment of a sprig of heather. Indeed, even those who dwell within the shadows of these formidable mountains are often unaware of their charms. In the early hours of February 13th 1692 the sulfurous smell of a fired gun hung in the air of these mountains. Men, women and children screamed in terror, withering against pain as they fell, bludgeoned to death by men of the army. The shameful scar of a dreadful and tragic event was etched upon the landscape of a beautiful and otherwise honorable place forever. Awoken by the sickly, metallic copper stink of fresh blood and death, Corran MacDonald is forced to flee into blizzard swept mountains. She mysteriously defies death only to come face to face with one of her enemies, Simon Campbell. With her family massacred and her village destroyed, Corran trusts the man when he offers to help her escape. But things aren't quite what they seem and very soon their bid for freedom is thwarted by Simon's old enemy and fellow Red Coat, Angus.

With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'World War II', 'Military History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'American History']","In his own book, Wartime, Paul Fussell called With the Old Breed ""one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war."" John Keegan referred to it in The Second World War as ""one of the most arresting documents in war literature."" And Studs Terkel was so fascinated with the story he interviewed its author for his book, ""The Good War."" What has made E.B. Sledge's memoir of his experience fighting in the South Pacific during World War II so devastatingly powerful is its sheer honest simplicity and compassion.Now including a new introduction by Paul Fussell, With the Old Breed presents a stirring, personal account of the vitality and bravery of the Marines in the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa. Born in Mobile, Alabama in 1923 and raised on riding, hunting, fishing, and a respect for history and legendary heroes such as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene Bondurant Sledge (later called ""Sledgehammer"" by his Marine Corps buddies) joined the Marines the year after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and from 1943 to 1946 endured the events recorded in this book. In those years, he passed, often painfully, from innocence to experience.Sledge enlisted out of patriotism, idealism, and youthful courage, but once he landed on the beach at Peleliu, it was purely a struggle for survival. Based on the notes he kept on slips of paper tucked secretly away in his New Testament, he simply and directly recalls those long months, mincing no words and sparing no pain. The reality of battle meant unbearable heat, deafening gunfire, unimaginable brutality and cruelty, the stench of death, and, above all, constant fear. Sledge still has nightmares about ""the bloody, muddy month of May on Okinawa."" But, as he also tellingly reveals, the bonds of friendship formed then will never be severed.Sledge's honesty and compassion for the other marines, even complete strangers, sets him apart as a memoirist of war.

A 50-year-old maid’s family was so poor during the communist Mao era, they bought their son a wife in exchange for a watch. Decades later, that same maid bought her daughter a nose job, and accidentally turned her into a model. In China today, a new luxury mall magically appears the week you go on vacation. Weekends are spent at fabulous pool parties.

Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It,,"['Nonfiction', 'Health', 'Food', 'Science', 'Nutrition', 'Self Help', 'Diets', 'Fitness', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']","
  [image]
An eye-opening, myth-shattering examination of what makes us fat, from acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes.In his New York Times best seller, Good Calories, Bad Calories, Taubes argued that our diet’s overemphasis on certain kinds of carbohydrates—not fats and not simply excess calories—has led directly to the obesity epidemic we face today. The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, Good Calories, Bad Calories immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as “a vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.” Building upon this critical work in Good Calories, Bad Calories and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what’s making us fat—and how we can change—in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, Why We Get Fat makes Taubes’s crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience.Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the “calories-in, calories-out” model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin’s regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, Why We Get Fat is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it.",,,,December 28th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780307272706,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320563681l/8727466.jpg,4.05,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Food & Cooking (2011)'],155.0,2.0,,,,93.0,19140.0,272,Knopf,"['7413', '6925', '3461', '940', '401']",,[],,['Gary Taubes']

"W, Or, The Memory of Childhood",,Fiction,"Guaranteed to send shock waves through the literary community, Perec's W tells two parallel stories. The first is autobiographical, describing the author's wartime boyhood. The second tale, denser, more disturbing, more horrifying, is the allegorical story of W, a mythical island off Tierra del Fuego, governed by the thrall of the Olympic ""ideal,"" where losers are tortured and winners held in temporary idolatry. As the reader soon discovers, W is a place where ""it is more important to be lucky than to be deserving,"" and ""you have to fight to live ... ÃwithÂ¨ no recourse, no mercy, no salvation, not even any hope that time will sort things out."" Here, sport is glorified and victors honored, but athletes are vilified, losers executed, stealing encouraged, rape common, and violence a fact of life. Perec's interpretive vision of the Holocaust forces us to ask the question central to our time: How did this happen before our eyes? How did we look at those ""shells of skin and bone, ashen faced, with their backs permanently bent, their eyes full of panic and their suppurating sores?"" How did all of this happen, not on W, but before millions of spectators, some horrified, some cheering, some in-different, but all present at the games watching the events of that grisly arena?",,,,2003.0,,,1567921582,9781567921588,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vuN10GmOHD0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.88,,,,,,,,,176.0,,,1395.0,,,['Georges Perec']

But when her first trip to high school results in a broken heart from the first boy to ever make her heart flutter and cruel words from an older girl she once thought a family friend, Nolan starts to question the very person she thought she was and wonders if her humble upbringing can compete with the afforded luxuries of her privileged peers.Throughout the next four years, Nolan struggles to maintain herself throughout her path of discovery, learning just how cruel teenagers can be through the pressures of underage drinking, sexuality and class. And despite how life seems to continue to work against her, she still manages to listen to her heart, falling deeper and deeper for the guy the entire town adores, even if he only sees her as a friend. Can Nolan strike a compromise between her own integrity and the boy she loves? And can she make him notice her before it’s too late?Reed Johnson came to Coolidge High School with a lot of fanfare.

In detention centers at Camp Bucha, Iraq, Bagram, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, Cuba they guard some of the most dangerous terrorists in history.The story is told by the soldiers themselves, recounting what they have seen and experienced, along with historical context and first-hand field observations by the author team who were provided with unique inside access. Warrior Police takes readers into the bloody streets of Iraq, the dangerous back-country of Afghanistan, and wherever our Military Police are needed.

Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story,,"['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Economics', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook', 'History']","An insightful and devastating account of how Wall Street lost its way from an insider who experienced the culture of Goldman Sachs first-hand. On March 14, 2012, more than three million people read Greg Smith's bombshell Op-Ed in the New York Times titled ""Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs."" The column immediately went viral, became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, and drew passionate responses from former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous ""take-the-money-and-run"" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off. His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars. From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank. Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a ""vampire squid"" that referred to its clients as ""muppets"" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large. After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly. He walked away from his career and took matters into his own hands.

Waiting,,"['Fiction', 'China', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Asian Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance']","In Waiting, PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author Ha Jin draws on his intimate knowledge of contemporary China to create a novel of unexpected richness and feeling. This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through the political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and stifle the promptings of his innermost heart.For more than seventeen years, this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever, modern woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village lives the wife his family chose for him when he was young--a humble and touchingly loyal woman, whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In a culture in which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and where adultery discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate love is stretched ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom.

Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the king. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. Both are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya—but neither wants to be.War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the king on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds—and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine.Set in a richly detailed world inspired by ancient Arabia, We Hunt the Flame is a gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.

What’s that Super Model Doing in my Workplace?,,[],"In What's that Super Model doing in My Workplace?, author Halinka Panzera explains why now given Globalisation and faltering economies we need to seek leaders with different characteristics. Social and economic change means that business behaviour needs to adapt. A profit-only, homogeneous male-dominated, institutionalised, single-minded approach to business will no longer secure business success in the future. We are already seeing decline in corporate performance among companies that are adhering to older models. A more broad-minded, balanced outlook that incorporates wider societal characteristics and priorities is needed. An organisation needs to develop a wide range of solutions to any given problem. Says Halinka Panzera, ""When organisations try to replicate the type of leadership they have had in the past, they don't maximise their problem solving. This 'dinosaur' style has had its day"". The Super Model has been created by research insights and provides a new approach for problem solving for CEO's, HR, Management, and new Leaders. Corporate evolution is possible, with insightful, evolving and confident people leading the way and willing to embrace change by contributing diverse thoughts, ideas and perspectives.

A normal family in many ways, the Rovaniemis struggle with sibling rivalry, parental expectations, and forming their own unique identities in such a large family. But when two of the children venture from the faith, the family fragments and a haunting question emerges: Do we believe for ourselves, or for each other? Each chapter is told from the distinctive point of view of a different Rovaniemi, drawing a nuanced, kaleidoscopic portrait of this unconventional family. The children who reject the church learn that freedom comes at the almost unbearable price of their close family ties, and those who stay struggle daily with the challenges of resisting the temptations of modern culture.

The Commandant's choice for 1993 was We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young. In November 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, were dropped by helicopter into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. How these men persevered--sacrificed themselves for their comrades and never gave up--makes a vivid portrait of war at its most inspiring and devastating. General Moore and Joseph Galloway, the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, have interviewed hundreds of men who fought there, including the North Vietnamese commanders. This devastating account rises above the specific ordeal it chronicles to present a picture of men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have found unimaginable only a few hours earlier.

A year later, he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and--even more important--on his writing. Equal parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.""",,,10/15/07,July 29th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780307269195,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473397159l/2195464._SY475_.jpg,3.85,[],470.0,6.0,,,,93.0,106227.0,188,Knopf Publishing Group,"['27769', '43583', '27699', '5839', '1337']",,[],,"['Haruki Murakami', 'Philip Gabriel']"

      A groundbreaking book about how your personality type determines who you love.
    
    Why do you fall in love with one person rather than another? In this fascinating and informative book, Helen Fisher, one of the world’s leading experts on romantic love, unlocks the hidden code of desire and attachment. Each of us, it turns out, primarily expresses one of four broad personality types—Explorer, Builder, Director, or Negotiator—and each of these types is governed by different chemical systems in the brain. Driven by this biology, we are attracted to partners who both mirror and complement our own personality type. 
    Based on entirely new research—including a detailed questionnaire completed by seven million people in thirty-three countries—Why Him? Why Her? will change your understanding of why you love him (or her) and help you use nature’s chemistry to find and keep your life partner.

Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns,,Poetry,"Winner of the 2005 Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets. In Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns, highly acclaimed poet and translator Daryl Hine brings to life the words of Hesiod and the world of Archaic Greece. While most available versions of these early Greek writings are rendered in prose, Hine's illuminating translations represent these early classics as they originally appeared, in verse. Since prose was not invented as a literary medium until well after Hesiod's time, presenting these works as poems more closely approximates not only the mechanics but also the melody of the originals. This volume includes Hesiod's Works and Days and Theogony, two of the oldest non-Homeric poems to survive from antiquity. Works and Days is in part a farmer's almanac—filled with cautionary tales and advice for managing harvests and maintaining a good work ethic—and Theogony is the earliest comprehensive account of classical mythology—including the names and genealogies of the gods (and giants and monsters) of Olympus, the sea, and the underworld. Hine brings out Hesiod's unmistakable personality; Hesiod's tales of his escapades and his gritty and persuasive voice not only give us a sense of the author's own character but also offer up a rare glimpse of the everyday life of ordinary people in the eighth century BCE. In contrast, the Homeric Hymns are more distant in that they depict aristocratic life in a polished tone that reveals nothing of the narrators' personalities. These hymns (so named because they address the deities in short invocations at the beginning and end of each) are some of the earliest examples of epyllia, or short stories in the epic manner in Greek. This volume unites Hine's skillful translations of the Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns—along with Hine's rendering of the mock-Homeric epic The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice—in a stunning pairing of these masterful classics.",,,,2005.0,,,0226329658,9780226329659,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h4JiAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.72,,,,,,,,,230.0,,,32.0,,,['Hesiod']

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn.

Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition.

They have been credited with elevating historical fiction to new heights and animating a period of history many thought too well known to be made fresh.Through the eyes and ears of Thomas Cromwell, the books' narrative prism, we are shown Tudor England, the court of King Henry VIII. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events.In Wolf Hall we witness Cromwell' s rise, beginning as clerk to Cardinal Wolsey, Henry' s chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. He is soon to become his successor. By 1535, when the action of Bring Up the Bodies begins, Cromwell is Chief Minister to Henry, his fortunes having risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry' s second wife. Anne' s days, though, are marked.

Now I’m letting my guard down.” —Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of What HappenedFor the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet. In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign and its aftermath—both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.",,,,September 12th 2017,['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],Kindle Edition,,B01MYE7QP0,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501171573l/34114362.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2017)'],351.0,4.0,,,,91.0,53165.0,512,Simon & Schuster,"['17257', '21237', '10002', '2556', '2113']",,[],,['Hillary Rodham Clinton']

During his forty-year career at General Electric, he led the company to year-after-year success around the globe, in multiple markets, against brutal competition.

He was America's best, with a record-breaking kill in Vietnam - a man who could be hidden, motionless, for days at a time, waiting for the microsecond in which he would take out an enemy with one clean shot at 1,300 yards. He did this 96 times. In recognition, the Marine Corps renamed its sniper range in his honor. Now Gray just wants to quietly live out his life as an assistant U.S. district attorney in New York, where he is raising three adopted children, all victims of the war he is trying resolutely to forget - and atone for. He never wants to see a rifle again. But suddenly, twenty-five years after Gray placed his Winchester rifle in the Marine Corps museum, a sniper is hunting him through the streets of New York City. The sniper's bullets find their mark. But the mark is not Gray. The sniper is challenging him, warning him that he will keep on killing until Gray picks up his rifle one more time.... Gray, falling in love with a woman who is beginning to break through his shell, is determined to protect her and his children.

Now in a new trade paperback edition, this masterful work explores the Father of Our Country - sometimes an unpopular hero, a man of great contradictions, but always a towering historical figure, who remains, as Flexner writes in these pages, ""a fallible human being made of flesh and blood and spirit - not a statue of marble and wood... a great and good man."" The author unflinchingly paints a portrait of Washington: slave owner, brave leader, man of passion, reluctant politician, and fierce general. His complex character and career are neither glorified nor vilified here; rather, Flexner sets up a brilliant counterpoint between Washington's public and private lives and gives us a challenging look at the man who has become as much a national symbol as the American flag.",,,11/06/74,February 22nd 1994,['George Washington'],Paperback,,9780316286169,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433307014l/254310._SY475_.jpg,4.11,[],87.0,1.0,,,,93.0,5549.0,423,Back Bay Books,"['2439', '1775', '964', '253', '118']",,[],,['James Thomas Flexner']

There, perhaps, lies the greatest irony of all, that I named myself anew after Estri Hadrath diet Estrazi, who in reality I had once been. And perhaps it is not irony at all, but an expression of Khys' humor, an implicit dissertation by him who structured my experiences, my very thoughts, for nearly two years, until his audacity drove him to bring together once more Sereth crill Tyris, past-Slayer, then the outlawed Ebvrasea, then arrar to the dharen himself; Chayin rendi Inekte, cahndor of Nemar, co-cahndor of the Taken Lands, chosen so of Tar-Kesa, and at that time Khys' puppet-vassal; and myself, former Well-Keepress, tiask of Nemar, and lastly becoming the chaldless outlaw who had come to judgment and endured ongoing retribution at the dharen's hands. To test his hesting, his power over owkahen, the time-coming-to-be, did Khys put us together, all three, in his Day-Keeper's city -- and from that moment onward, the Weathers of Life became fixed: siphoned into a singular future; sealed tight as a dead god in his mausoleum, whose every move brought him closer to the sum total, obliteration.

Jenny Rudea, veterinarian in training, is madly in love with Jack, and the animals she cares for. On the way home from her house one night, Jack takes an unanticipated detour to Hosner Lake to bolster his courage and contemplate how he'll ask Jenny to be his wife. While there, he encounters something that raises the hair on the back of his neck. What is out there on the other side of the lake? Is it a shadow, a hunter, an animal? Without a weapon or a flashlight, he is not about to stick around to find out.He hops on his bike and heads for the main road where something leaps onto his back, causing the accident that steals his mobility, threatens his sanity. As if this isn't bad enough, when he wakes up in the hospital, paralyzed from the waist down, he has no idea what occurred on the lonely road, but is now a prime suspect in a murder investigation because of what was found almost pinned to his body: a naked girl whose throat has been slit. In his comatose state, Jack hears detectives interview Jenny at his bedside. He eventually regains consciousness and is transferred to a rehab where he hopes to recover the use of his legs. The police are searching for a serial killer; bodies have been piling up across the country, as well as in Angel's Bend. While Jack struggles with his physical injuries, he must also defend his innocence.Jack manages to get in and out of the window of his room mysteriously, at will, even though he's in a wheelchair. The only one who notices his disappearing acts is his physical therapist, Rachel Huntress, who is almost as weird as the predicament Jack has found himself in. His extraordinary abilities, and changing appearance, don't seem to faze her at all. There are tense scenes which include violence and raw emotion in this whodunit. Who is the murderous werewolf? Jack? Or could it be his high school rival, Detective Don Delgado. It's anyone's guess. Along with bodies, there are several possible suspects. This killer is not part of a pack. He's a ruthless rogue. The story is stunningly intense, with gripping internalization from Jack's and Jenny's points of view.

For level-ten parasensitive Clare Lancaster, they're a minefield. The elite few who know her secret call her a human lie detector, and any falsehood, no matter how subtle or well hidden, sets her blood racing. Over the years, Clare has come to accept that someone with her extraordinary talents is unlikely to find a suitable mate.

In all the current highly publicized debates about creationism and its descendant ""intelligent design,"" there is an element of the controversy that is rarely mentioned—the ""evidence,"" the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies, have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past—dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs. Why Evolution Is True weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the ""indelible stamp"" of the processes first proposed by Darwin.

Wolf Totem,,"['Fiction', 'China', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'Chinese Literature', 'Animals', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Asian Literature', 'Wolves']","An epic Chinese tale in the vein of The Last Emperor, Wolf Totem depicts the dying culture of the Mongols-the ancestors of the Mongol hordes who at one time terrorized the world-and the parallel extinction of the animal they believe to be sacred: the fierce and otherworldly Mongolian wolf  Published under a pen name, Wolf Totem was a phenomenon in China, breaking all sales records there and earning the distinction of being the second most read book after Mao's little red book. There has been much international excitement too-to date, rights have been sold in thirteen countries. Wolf Totem is set in 1960s China-the time of the Great Leap Forward, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution.  Searching for spirituality, Beijing intellectual Chen Zhen travels to the pristine grasslands of Inner Mongolia to live among the nomadic Mongols-a proud, brave, and ancient race of people who coexist in perfect harmony with their unspeakably beautiful but cruel natural surroundings. Their philosophy of maintaining a balance with nature is the ground stone of their religion, a kind of cult of the wolf.  The fierce wolves that haunt the steppes of the unforgiving grassland searching for food are locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival-a life-and-death dance that has gone on between them for thousands of years. The Mongols believe that the wolf is a great and worthy foe that they are divinely instructed to contend with, but also to worship and to learn from. Chen's own encounters with the otherworldly wolves awake a latent primitive instinct in him, and his fascination with them blossoms into obsession, then reverence.  After many years, the peace is shattered with the arrival of Chen's kinfolk, Han Chinese, sent from the cities to bring modernity to the grasslands. They immediately launch a campaign to exterminate the wolves, sending the balance that has been maintained with religious dedication for thousands of years into a spiral leading to extinction-first the wolves, then the Mongol culture, finally the land. As a result of the eradication of the wolves, rats become a plague and wild sheep graze until the meadows turn to dust. Mongolian dust storms glide over Beijing, sometimes blocking out the moon.  Part period epic, part fable for modern days, Wolf Totem is a stinging social commentary on the dangers of China's overaccelerated economic growth as well as a fascinating immersion into the heart of Chinese culture.",,,04/01/04,March 27th 2008,"['Batu', '陳陣', 'Chen Zhen', 'Bilgee', 'Yang Ke', 'Uljii', 'Gasmai', 'Erlang', 'Yir', 'Kuning']",Hardcover,,9781594201561,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438826486l/1217728._SY475_.jpg,4.03,"['Man Asian Literary Prize (2007)', '亞洲週刊中文十大好書 (2004)']",266.0,3.0,,,,92.0,3616.0,527,Penguin Press,"['1401', '1267', '673', '194', '81']",,['內蒙古 (China)'],,"['Jiang Rong', 'Howard Goldblatt']"

For centuries, wolves have haunted the human imagination. It has been accepted as conventional wisdom that they are savage predators, creatures of nightmare. Determined to overcome such misconceptions, Jim and Jamie Dutcher spent six years in a tented camp on the edge of Idaho's wilderness, living with and filming a pack of wolves. Now, in this lyrical memoir, the Dutchers share their experience of life among these intelligent and elusive animals. By socializing with the pack from the time they were pups, the Dutchers were able to gain the wolves' trust and observe their behavior in a way that few people ever have. What they witnessed was remarkable: a complex nature oriented toward family life and strong social bonds. Wolves at Our Door is much more than a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Dutchers' Emmy Award-winning Discovery Channel documentary.

As a poet, he infused verse with the wild lyricism and mesmerizing beat of rock. By the time of his death in 1971, Morrison had become one of the most haunting voices in the collective unconscious of America, echoed by performers such as Patti Smith.This book, compiled from the Morrison literary estate by his beloved friends, presents Morrison's unpublished work for the first time--poems that celebrate the juju of sex, the touring musician's labyrinth of highways, airports, and motel corridors, and the shamanistic power of rock'n'roll, as well as photographs, drawings, facsimiles from Morrison's diaries, and a self-interview that reveals him as he has never been revealed before.

The New York Times, reporting on the phenomenon, described Guthrie's appeal and legacy succinctly: ""(Woody Guthrie was) one of the most influential cultural figures of the century. Guthrie inspired Bob Dylan and virtually created the modern folk tradition and singer-songwriter genre, and his music remains as vital today as when he was performing"".Born in Oklahoma in 1912, Guthrie spent his early years among the farmers and migrant workers of the dust bowl. As a young man during the Great Depression, he traveled across the country by boxcar with his guitar, composing the indelible folk ballads that made him a leader of the politically vital folk movement of the pre-war era. Tragically, the onset of Huntington's disease, gradually diminished his mind, body, and work, and led to his untimely death at the age of 55.

  On the eve of America’s greatest victory in the Pacific, a catastrophic event disrupts the course of World War II, forever changing the rules of combat. . . . 
The impossible has spawned the unthinkable. A military experiment in the year 2021 has thrust an American-led multinational armada back to 1942, right into the middle of the U.S. naval task force speeding toward Midway Atoll—and what was to be the most spectacular U.S. triumph of the entire war. Thousands died in the chaos, but the ripples had only begun. For these veterans of Pearl Harbor—led by Admirals Nimitz, Halsey, and Spruance—have never seen a helicopter, or a satellite link, or a nuclear weapon. And they’ve never encountered an African American colonel or a British naval commander who was a woman and half-Pakistani. While they embrace the armada’s awesome firepower, they may find the twenty-first century sailors themselves far from acceptable.Initial jubilation at news the Allies would win the war is quickly doused by the chilling realization that the time travelers themselves—by their very presence—have rendered history null and void. Celebration turns to dread when the possibility arises that other elements of the twenty-first century task force may have also made the trip—and might now be aiding Yamamoto and the Japanese.What happens next is anybody’s guess—and everybody’s nightmare. . . .From the Trade Paperback edition.",Axis of Time #1,,01/01/04,June 1st 2005,"['J.

In one instant, all around the world, for politicians and peasants, from Gaza to Geneva, things will never be the same. A wave of inexplicable energy has slammed into the continental United States.
  America, as we know it, is gone. . . .
  
    WITHOUT WARNING
  
Now U.S. soldiers are fighting a war without command or control. A correspondent records horrors for no one. Washington is gone and the line of succession is in tatters; the functioning remnants of government are in Pearl Harbor, Guantánamo Bay, and one desperate, isolated corner of the Northwest. For the jihadists, it’s Allah’s miracle. For Saddam, it’s a chance to attack. Iran declares war on an America that doesn’t exist–except in the hearts and souls of the men and women who want it to.In this astounding work of alternate fiction, John Birmingham hurtles us into a scenario that is unimaginable but shatteringly real: a world of financial ruin where a cloud of noxious waste–from America’s burning cities–darkens Europe, while men and women in offices around the globe struggle to make decisions that cannot hold and opportunists unleash their secret demons.From a slick Texas lawyer who happens to be in the right place at the right time to a hard-working city engineer in Seattle who becomes his terrified city’s only hope, from the cancer-stricken secret agent to a drug runner off the Mexican coast and a U.S. general in Cuba, Without Warning tells a fast, furious story of survival, violence, and a new, soul-shattering reality.",The Disappearance #1,,,February 3rd 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780345502896,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435693408l/3556730._SY475_.jpg,3.76,[],93.0,1.0,,,,90.0,2981.0,516,Del Rey Books,"['716', '1203', '762', '222', '78']",,[],,['John Birmingham']

In the summer before Cullen's senior year, a nominally-depressed birdwatcher named John Barling thinks he spots a species of woodpecker thought to be extinct since the 1940s in Lily, Arkansas. His rediscovery of the so-called Lazarus Woodpecker sparks a flurry of press and woodpecker-mania. Soon all the kids are getting woodpecker haircuts and everyone's eating ""Lazarus burgers."" But as absurd as the town's carnival atmosphere has become, nothing is more startling than the realization that Cullen’s sensitive, gifted fifteen-year-old brother Gabriel has suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. While Cullen navigates his way through a summer of finding and losing love, holding his fragile family together, and muddling his way into adulthood, a young missionary in Africa, who has lost his faith, is searching for any semblance of meaning wherever he can find it. As distant as the two stories seem at the start, they are thoughtfully woven ever closer together and through masterful plotting, brought face to face in a surprising and harrowing climax. Complex but truly extraordinary, tinged with melancholy and regret, comedy and absurdity, this novel finds wonder in the ordinary and emerges as ultimately hopeful.

From the Book of Revelation to The Road Warrior, from A Canticle for Leibowitz to The Road, storytellers have long imagined the end of the world, weaving eschatological tales of catastrophe, chaos, and calamity. In doing so, these visionary authors have addressed one of the most challenging and enduring themes of imaginative fiction: The nature of life in the aftermath of total societal collapse. Gathering together the best post-apocalyptic literature of the last two decades from many of today's most renowned authors of speculative fiction - including George R. R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Orson Scott Card, Carol Emshwiller, Jonathan Lethem, Octavia E. Butler, and Stephen King - Wastelands explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon. Whether the end of the world comes through nuclear war, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm, these are tales of survivors, in some cases struggling to rebuild the society that was, in others, merely surviving, scrounging for food in depopulated ruins and defending themselves against monsters, mutants, and marauders. Wastelands delves into this bleak landscape, uncovering the raw human emotion and heart-pounding thrills at the genre's core. --back coverContains the following stories:Introduction by John Joseph AdamsThe End of the Whole Mess by Stephen KingSalvage by Orson Scott CardThe People of Sand and Slag by Paolo BacigalupiBread and Bombs by M.

The son of an Alabama sharecropper, and now a sixth-term United States Congressman, John Lewis has led an extraordinary life, one that found him at the epicenter of the civil rights movement in the late '50s and '60s.

When I Don't Desire God,How to Fight for Joy,Religion,"For over twenty-five years John Piper has trumpeted the truth that “God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.” He calls it Christian Hedonism. The problem is that many people, after being persuaded, find that this truth is both liberating and devastating. It’s liberating because it endorses our inborn desire for joy. And it’s devastating because it reveals that we don’t desire God the way we should. What do you do when you discover the good news that God wants you to be content in him, but then find that you aren’t? If joy in God were merely the icing on the cake of Christian commitment, this book would be insignificant. But Piper argues that joy is so much more. Our being satisfied in God is necessary to show God’s worthiness and to sustain sacrifices of love. Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. He tasted it. It sustained him through the deepest suffering. His Father was glorified. His people were saved. That is what joy in God does. The absolutely urgent question becomes: What can I do if I don’t have it?

Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Politics', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir']","The bestselling author of Into the Wild, Into Thin Air, and Under the Banner of Heaven delivers a stunning, eloquent account of a remarkable young man’s haunting journey.Like the men whose epic stories Jon Krakauer has told in his previous bestsellers, Pat Tillman was an irrepressible individualist and iconoclast. In May 2002, Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11, and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later, he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.Though obvious to most of the two dozen soldiers on the scene that a ranger in Tillman’s own platoon had fired the fatal shots, the Army aggressively maneuvered to keep this information from Tillman’s wife, other family members, and the American public for five weeks following his death. During this time, President Bush repeatedly invoked Tillman’s name to promote his administration’s foreign policy. Long after Tillman’s nationally televised memorial service, the Army grudgingly notified his closest relatives that he had “probably” been killed by friendly fire while it continued to dissemble about the details of his death and who was responsible.In Where Men Win Glory, Jon Krakauer draws on Tillman’s journals and letters, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and extensive research on the ground in Afghanistan to render an intricate mosaic of this driven, complex, and uncommonly compelling figure as well as the definitive account of the events and actions that led to his death. Before he enlisted in the army, Tillman was familiar to sports aficionados as an undersized, overachieving Arizona Cardinals safety whose virtuosity in the defensive backfield was spellbinding. With his shoulder-length hair, outspoken views, and boundless intellectual curiosity, Tillman was considered a maverick. America was fascinated when he traded the bright lights and riches of the NFL for boot camp and a buzz cut. Sent first to Iraq—a war he would openly declare was “illegal as hell”—and eventually to Afghanistan, Tillman was driven by complicated, emotionally charged, sometimes contradictory notions of duty, honor, justice, patriotism, and masculine pride, and he was determined to serve his entire three-year commitment. But on April 22, 2004, his life would end in a barrage of bullets fired by his fellow soldiers.Krakauer chronicles Tillman’s riveting, tragic odyssey in engrossing detail highlighting his remarkable character and personality while closely examining the murky, heartbreaking circumstances of his death. Infused with the power and authenticity readers have come to expect from Krakauer’s storytelling, Where Men Win Glory exposes shattering truths about men and war.From the inside cover of ISBN 0385522266 / 9780385522267",,,September 15th 2008,September 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780385522267,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439088374l/2936415._SY475_.jpg,4.05,[],30.0,1.0,,,,94.0,30922.0,383,Doubleday Books,"['11016', '12551', '5598', '1251', '506']",,[],,['Jon Krakauer']
War Junkie,,"['War', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'Journalism']","Jon Steele is a war junkie. Soon after starting work as an ITN cameraman, he began to feel strangely at home in the kind of places ordinary people get evacuated from. Before long, he was living for the rush which comes as bullets fly past your head and bombs explode at your feet. Normal life just couldn't compete...In Georgia, Jon filmed on the last flight out of the besieged airport at Sokhumi, as the plane took off in the dead of night, all lights extinguished, going the wrong way down the runway, directly towards the nearby steep and virtually invisible mountain range while Abkhazian soldiers fired off random anti-aircraft shells in their general direction. In Moscow, he filmed in the midst of chaos as armed rebels and Militia fought bloodthirsty, hand-to-hand battles on the streets around him. In Rwanda, he filmed the horrific aftermath to the most brutal massacre of modern times - and his own neck got far too close to the edge of a machete for comfort. In Zaire, he filmed endless fields full of young children deranged by hunger and ravaged by cholera. In Bosnia, Jon realised that he had, in fact, seen and filmed more than he could cope with, and finally spiralled out of control, deep into emotional meltdown.But somehow War Junkie is also an incredibly funny and exhilarating book. The humour is dark but sharp as broken glass. The action comes so thick and fast you can forget to breathe.

Want Not,,"['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'New York', 'Novels', 'Unfinished', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club']","A compulsively readable, deeply human novel that examines our most basic and unquenchable emotion: want.  With his critically acclaimed first novel Dear American Airlines, Jonathan Miles was widely praised as a comic genius “after something bigger” (David Ulin, Los Angeles Times) whose fiction was “not just philosophically but emotionally rewarding” (Richard Russo, New York Times Book Review, front cover). Now, in his much anticipated second novel, Want Not, Miles takes a giant leap forward with this highly inventive and corrosively funny story of our times, a three-pronged tale of human excess that sifts through the detritus of several disparate lives—lost loves, blown chances, countless words and deeds misdirected or misunderstood—all conjoined in their come-hell-or-high-water search for fulfillment.As the novel opens on Thanksgiving Day, readers are telescoped into three different worlds in various states of disrepair—a young freegan couple living off the grid in New York City; a once-prominent linguist, sacked at midlife by the dissolution of his marriage and his father’s losing battle with Alzheimer’s; and a self-made debt-collecting magnate, whose brute talent for squeezing money out of unlikely places has yielded him a royal existence, trophy wife included.Want and desire propel these characters forward toward something, anything, more, until their worlds collide, briefly, randomly, yet irrevocably, in a shattering ending that will haunt readers long after the last page is turned.With a satirist’s eye and a romantic’s heart, Miles captures the morass and comedy of contemporary life in all its excess. Bold, unblinking, unforgettable in its irony and pathos, Want Not is a wicked, bighearted literary novel that confirms the arrival of a major voice in American fiction.

She exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this “feminine” weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activist must work to embrace and empower femininity—in all of its wondrous forms.",,,,May 14th 2007,[],Paperback,,9781580051545,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328853725l/605663.jpg,4.23,[],197.0,2.0,,,,95.0,5988.0,390,Seal Press,"['2865', '2050', '800', '154', '119']",,[],,['Julia Serano']

Water and Life,,[],"Water exists in many places in the universe and may be the principal element for life on Earth's surface. Its presence is a hallmark of the habitable zones for living things (humans, animals, and plants). About 70 percent of Earth's surface is covered with water, but only about 1 percent of the water on Earth's surface is usable by living things (groundwater and surface water). Water has several properties that make it unique among compounds and make it possible for all forms of known life to function. Water is a uniquely wonderful substance on Earth that naturally occurs in three different states: solid, liquid, and gaseous. All living things depend on water. When water resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened. Water scarcity is a function of cultural activities and human civilization. It is very important to highlight water's pivotal role as the essential ingredient for life and to develop a comprehensive framework for creating water-resource policies to manage water resources.

Witness,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Middle Grade', 'Childrens', 'School', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Juvenile']","The Barnes & Noble ReviewKaren Hesse's Newbery Award-winning skills are put to great use in Witness, a poetic tale about friendship, fanaticism, and the deadly undercurrents of racial prejudice. The story takes place in a small Vermont town in the year 1924, revealing the devastating impact of the Ku Klux Klan on this pastoral, insular community. At the heart of the tale are two motherless girls who come to the attention of the newly formed Klan: 12-year-old Leanora Sutter, who is black, and 6-year-old Esther Hirsch, who is Jewish. Hesse tells her story, which is based on real events, through the eyes of 11 different characters. Each point of view is expressed in poetic form, but with a stark clarity of difference that makes the voices unique and identifiable. There is a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose sermons reveal him as a zealot and whose actions brand him as a hypocrite. There is a middle-aged farm woman named Sara who takes Esther under her wing despite the warnings of her neighbors, trying to help the child understand why the Klan has marked her and her widowed father as targets for their hatred. Esther's only other friend is Leanora, who is about to learn some harsh lessons on tolerance and hatred herself at the hands of the Klan. And linking them all together is 18-year-old Merlin Van Tornhout, a young man struggling to fit in with the adult world and determine for himself the difference between right and wrong. The remaining characters who circle the periphery of this core group reflect the various mind-sets and biases that were common during this era of fear and persecution, even in a setting as bucolic as the Vermont countryside.Hesse weaves real historic events into her tale, such as the murder trial of the infamous kidnappers Leopold and Loeb, giving the work a definite period flavor. Using prose that is both sparse and powerful, she builds the tension with a slow crescendo of inevitability that ends in violence, but also offers up an unforgettable lesson on the true power of friendship and acceptance.

In a compelling narrative, Marlantes weaves riveting accounts of his combat experiences with thoughtful analysis, self-examination and his readings -- from Homer to the Mahabharata to Jung. He talks frankly about how he is haunted by the face of the young North Vietnamese soldier he killed at close quarters and how he finally finds a way to make peace with his past. Marlantes discusses the daily contradictions that warriors face in the grind of war, where each battle requires them to take life or spare life, and where they enter a state he likens to the fervor of religious ecstasy.Just as Matterhorn is already being acclaimed as a classic of war literature, What It Is Like To Go To War is set to become required reading for anyone -- soldier or civilian -- interested in this visceral and all too essential part of the human experience.",,,,August 30th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780802119926,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438699073l/11290708._SX318_.jpg,3.87,['Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)'],190.0,3.0,,,,88.0,8047.0,257,Atlantic Monthly Press,"['2699', '2930', '1466', '591', '361']",,[],,['Karl Marlantes']

White Boy in Watts,,[],"British Grit-LitThe world of the Cab Driver is uncertain and dangerous. It is populated by oddballs, weirdoes, comedians, eccentrics, head cases, prima donnas and hard cases. But no more so than when you're a white English guy working Watts, Compton and Inglewood, home to the infamous Bloods and Crips. I truly never knew what to expect next, and during my time driving cab in South-Central L.A. in the 1980's I got myself into some scrapes. I’ve intended to paint an ominous picture of a community destroyed by drugs, guns and violence. You’ll almost smell the omnipresent whiff of cheap wine, and feel the dirty lino under your feet. Read the true life adventures of an English lad as I struggled to make a living amongst ‘gangstas’ who are arguably the most violent in the United States. If you enjoy True Gangsta Books, or books about the Bloods or Crips, then take a chance on this one People have always told me I’m a natural storyteller. Comments on my writing style warn that I ""talk to the reader with all the confidence of a man in touch with his own reality, in a voice which is seasoned with a hint of world weariness that is so telling of a writer who has written what he knows and written it with disarming fearlessness."" And that I guess is true. You’ll be able to hear my characters, see them and, in some instances, actually smell them. They’ll leave their stain on you. You may well be able to relate to guys who used their fists and their wits, you may laugh at their humour and get their jokes, but it’ll be the thugs with guns and no soul who will unsettle you. I want you to be scared of them. Come and have a look at the world through my eyes in the 1980's, and, like me, marvel that I got out of there alive.“Can I just say I'm not a real big sit down and read sort of guy.... But this book had me hooked from the 1st few lines. I've never finished a book this quickly. Highly recommended to anyone!!”“Absolutely incredible! I read the sample and had to buy the book. I usually never buy books and just find them online but I had to make the exception for this due to the author's eloquence. The stories are really funny and serious when they need to be. I definitely would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a genuinely straight up genius work. Karl Wiggins is like a contemporary Socrates.” (BLIMEY!)“White Boy in Watts is rather like driving what Karl might term a ‘dodgy motor’. You climb in and then before you know it you are coasting in fifth, Ray-Bans on, wind in your hair, lovely! Suddenly you grind to a disturbing, hissing halt. Karl drops a spanner in the works, a bag of sugar into his cavernous tank of diesel fuelled wisdom and you stall in awestruck wonder at his incredible insight. So there you are, stranded in Watts with a dozen members of the Bounty Hunters or the Mad Swan Bloods trying to rock your car over, with no option but to stop, gather your thoughts, catch your breath and carry on reading, because by this time you’re unstoppable.”“Karl Wiggins is a natural storyteller, and ‘White Boy in Watts’ is a compulsive read, bringing to life all the not-so-ordinary people and places that are generally under-represented in literature. His direct, easy-going style and zest for living are infectious.”This is a very short book, 50 pages or so, that's all, but these are stories that need to be told.

Words are our Sorcery,,"['Writing', 'Poetry', 'New Age', 'Cooking']","Trance Poetry. You know those ….. drifting kinds of thoughts? When it’s easy to believe that someone else is dreaming you? Well that’s Trance Poetry. The purpose of the poems in this book are to try and show how words alone can lift you up and take you places, how they can enchant and bewitch, creating the illusion that just for a few minutes everything’s alright with the world. When I started to write poetry I searched around for subject matter, and chose colour. Not yellow, red and blue, but Paprika, Jet, Ochre, Huckleberry Blue, Fiesta etc. and went inside trying to see where that ‘colour’ would take me. From this I created a series of poems which I entitled Colour-oetry, and I’ve included these here as well. Only half of this book is poetry, well 56% to be precise. A while ago I took an interest in the parallel lives of the chef and the writer. How the chef creates his magic in the chaotic environment of the kitchen compares well with how the writer creates his hocus-pocus in the peace and quiet of his study. A chef’s wizardry is in his ingredients, whilst a writer’s sorcery is in his words. So I wrote a few chapters on food, following it all over the world at one stage, attempting to paint pictures with my words. But I also focused on the 'writer,' comparing him or her not only to the chef but also to other master tradesmen, even a bricklayer at one stage. Deep down this is the purpose of this book, to discuss the art of the writer and the sorcery in his words. Whether I’ve succeeded or not, only the reader can tell. I’ve finished the book with three chapters on parenting experiences. True stories actually. My goal here is to use the writer’s sorcery to establish emotion and hopefully leave you with a lump in your throat.

Wrong Planet - Searching for your Tribe,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help']","The most unexpected and revealing book of our time. A rallying cry for the elusive spirit of these time. A cry for those who want to change the world!Karl Wiggins has a powerful and potent knack for expression which has completely escaped restraint and self-control. Too much writing nowadays is watered-down garbage. The world is looking for something new, and in this book, Wiggins has created many ‘worth-pondering-over’ ideas!We are experiencing the same intensity of energy in diminished and more concise time periods, which is why more and more Wrong Planet tribes are gatheringKarl Wiggins informed me, when I agreed to write the forward for this book, that his goal was for those he calls Carefree Scamps to finish the book slightly punch-drunk. And I admit that with me he’s managed it remarkably. If you don’t believe that a limited number of astute, dedicated human beings can change the world, or simply just call attention to its imperfections and vulnerabilities, this book is going to change your mind. But before you get there, in the first third of the book Karl introduces us to a number of famous eccentrics who just didn’t (or don’t) ‘fit in’ He discusses the erratic, the bizarre and the downright kooky. People such as David Bowie, Marilyn Monroe, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Arthur Rimbaud, François Villon (the Medieval Beatnik), Bessie Stringfield, Sixteen-String Jack Rann, Anne Bonny & Mary Read (the Lesbian Pirates), Frida Kahlo, the Beat Generation poets and a whole host of dropouts, misfits, pranksters, bohemians, court jesters, comedians, crackpots and Gypsies.The reader will love reading about these swashbuckling daredevils, headcases and artists who changed their world, and even more so when Wiggins goes on to blend some of them with those from his own tribe.

(She's also itching for Adam, her longtime friend and colleague, to see her as more than just a little girl, but that's another matter.)Suddenly, Savannah gets the chance she's been waiting for: Recruited by another supernatural detective, she travels to Columbus, Washington, a small, dying town. Two troubled young women have been found in an abandoned warehouse, murdered. Now a third woman's dead, and on closer inspection small details point to darker forces at play.

Whitey Bulger: America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt That Brought Him to Justice,,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Biography', 'Crime', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Unfinished', 'American']","This unforgettable narrative follows the astonishing career and epic manhunt for Whitey Bulger—a gangster whose life was more sensational than fiction.Raised in a South Boston housing project, James ""Whitey"" Bulger became the most wanted fugitive of his generation. In this riveting story, rich with family ties and intrigue, award-winning Boston Globe reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy follow Whitey's extraordinary criminal career--from teenage thievery to bank robberies to the building of his underworld empire and a string of brutal murders. It was after a nine-year stint in Alcatraz and other prisons that Whitey reunited with his brother William ""Billy"" Bulger, who was soon to become one of Massachusetts's most powerful politicians. He also became reacquainted with John Connolly, who had grown up around the corner from the Bulgers and was now--with Billy's help--a rising star at the FBI.Once Whitey emerged triumphant from the bloody Boston gang wars, Connolly recruited him as an informant against the Mafia. Their clandestine relationship made Whitey untouchable; the FBI overlooked gambling, drugs, and even homicide to protect their source. Among the close-knit Irish community in South Boston, nothing was more important than honor and loyalty, and nothing was worse than being a rat. Whitey is charged with the deaths of nineteen people killed over turf, for business, and even for being informants; yet to this day he denies he ever gave up his friends or landed anyone in jail.Based on exclusive access and previously undisclosed documents, Cullen and Murphy explore the truth of the Whitey Bulger story. They reveal for the first time the extent of his two parallel family lives with different women, as well as his lifelong paranoia stemming in part from his experience in the CIA's MKULTRA program. They describe his support of the IRA and his hitherto-unknown role in the Boston busing crisis, and they show a keen understanding of his mindset while on the lam and behind bars. The result is the first full portrait of this legendary criminal figure--a gripping story of wiseguys and cops, horrendous government malfeasance, and a sixteen-year manhunt that climaxed in Whitey's dramatic capture in Santa Monica in June 2011.",,,,February 11th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780393087727,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358133097l/16241144.jpg,3.96,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2013)'],83.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1814.0,496,W.

While most of us might take dictionaries for granted, the process of writing them is in fact as lively and dynamic as language itself. With sharp wit and irreverence, Kory Stamper cracks open the complex, obsessive world of lexicography--from the agonizing decisions about what and how to define, to the knotty questions of usage in an ever-changing language. She explains why small words are the most difficult to define (have you ever tried to define is ?), how it can take nine months to define a single word, and how our biases about language and pronunciation can have tremendous social influence. Throughout, Stamper brings to life the hallowed halls (and highly idiosyncratic cubicles) of Merriam-Webster, a world inhabited by quirky, erudite individuals who quietly shape the way we communicate.

But when their beloved father falls ill, Meredith and Nina find themselves together again, standing alongside their cold, disapproving mother, Anya, who even now, offers no comfort to her daughters.

When we reached my bedroom, I thought his jaw was going to drag the floor.""This is your room?” he asked with an odd sternness to his voice. Watching him survey the four walls, I nodded. He turned to me, his face completely disconcerted, and pointed at the entrance. “Chase, there's no door!""I shrugged. I hadn't thought this far through when I invited him in.""Privacy is for adults, I am not an adult yet,"" I replied in a mocking tone, trying to laugh it off.

I stared up into those stormy eyes and braced myself. He was about to wreck me again.""I know we haven't known each other long, but seriously, Chase, there's so much more to you than this,"" he said waving his hands around my room and gritting his teeth out of anger.I don't know if it was the repressed thought of this being the last time I would see him or touch him suddenly surfacing, or the way he was already fighting for me, a girl he barely knew, but something inside of me broke. The innocent nature of my feelings towards him crumbled. My hesitation melted away as I stepped closer and with both hands I grabbed onto his shirt.

Her dress, her fiancé and the location—the idyllic holiday ranch in Brazil—are perfect.  But all Aimee’s plans come crashing down when the private jet that’s taking her from the U.S. to the ranch—where her fiancé awaits her—defects mid-flight and the pilot is forced to perform an emergency landing in the heart of the Amazon rainforest.  With no way to reach civilisation, being rescued is Aimee and Tristan’s—the pilot—only hope. A slim one that slowly withers away, desperation taking its place. Because death wanders in the jungle under many forms: starvation, diseases. Beasts.  As Aimee and Tristan fight to find ways to survive, they grow closer. Together they discover that facing old, inner agonies carved by painful pasts takes just as much courage, if not even more, than facing the rainforest.  Despite her devotion to her fiancé, Aimee can’t hide her feelings for Tristan—the man for whom she’s slowly becoming everything. You can hide many things in the rainforest. But not lies. Or love.  Withering Hope is the story of a man who desperately needs forgiveness and the woman who brings him hope.

Worth Dying For,,"['Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Action', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Detective']","#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “Compulsively readable.”—The Wall Street Journal “Don’t pick up [this] Jack Reacher novel if you don’t have some time on your hands, because Worth Dying For is difficult to put down. . . . Child manages to get an amazing amount of suspense into the novel.”—Associated Press   There’s deadly trouble in the corn county of Nebraska . . . and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go.   The Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Lee Child's The Affair.  “A model of suspenseful storytelling and an outstanding addition to a series that stands in the front rank of modern thrillers.”—The Washington Post “Still the thinking man’s action hero, supreme butt-kicker and smartest guy in the room.”—The Seattle Times “This series is about as good as pop fiction gets.”—The Miami Herald",Jack Reacher #15,,09/30/10,October 19th 2010,"['Seth Duncan', 'Eleanor Duncan', 'Dorothy Coe', 'Jack Reacher']",ebook,,9780440339342,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356095648l/8357992.jpg,4.21,[],260.0,3.0,,,,97.0,78426.0,400,Delacorte Press,"['32621', '32096', '11530', '1622', '557']",,['Nebraska (United States)'],,['Lee Child']

Western Song,,"['Romance', 'Love Story', 'Fiction', 'New Adult', 'Novels', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Drama', 'Adult Fiction']","When Weston Beaudurant’s buddy, rodeo clown Cody Goode is killed in a rodeo accident -- gored by the maniacal bull Baby Face that Weston is riding, Weston is consumed with guilt. The day after the accident, while going through Cod’s papers, lawyer Wynona Vasquez discovers that he had been secretly engaged to a Thai immigrant who is arriving by train that evening.	Elected by unanimous decision to be the welcoming committee, Weston arrives at the train station prepared for anything but the lovely forlorn creature he finds waiting in the rain. Though appearing waif-like, Song Phan-Rang is anything but fragile. Her mettle quickly rises to the surface in her determination to remain in Y-oh-ming.	Forced together by their circumstances, Weston and Song are explosive. Used to solitude, Weston is driven crazy by the obliging Song. But as Song shows her prowess not only as a housekeeper and cook, but as a rider and rancher as well, Weston discovers that against his best efforts (and damned if he'll ever admit it) -- he's falling in love.	The morning after the Christmas Cotillion, where cowboys by the dozen lined up for a dance with the exotic Song, and Weston wrangled the last one, she discovers her visa has expired. Pledging her Uncle Thieu's farm in Thailand as a dowry, Song asks Weston to marry her. Swearing that this is not a good idea at all -- he does.	Song blossoms in America. Weston's sister Olive, a schoolteacher, helps Song with her English, and introduces her to the ideas of the Founding Fathers, most notably Tom Paine. Firebrand and activist Wynona employs Song in her office. Her first assignment is working with Shoshone shaman MAD BULL and Bull's young assistant, Jack Deerstalker as they fight a referendum that would allow gambling on their reservation.	As winter melts into spring, Song and Weston continue to profess their marriage is simply one of convenience, though it is obvious to everybody that the two are in love. Obvious to everyone that is, but Jack Deerstalker who has fallen for her himself.	One night as Weston returns earlier than expected from a rodeo, he finds Jack in his living room, alone with Song. Enraged, Weston explodes, throwing Jack out of the house. That night a fierce winter storm blows. The creek rises and floods, endangering thirty head of cattle caught on the other side. Song springs into action, riding side by side with Weston. When a baby calf slips into the icy creek, Song plunges in after it. Together, Weston and Song pull the animal free. Weston is knocked speechless by her bravery. Later, as he warms her by a roaring fire, Song and Weston make love for the first time.	A few days later, Wynona and Song are introduced to the case of illegal immigrant Thai workers, forced to toil as slaves in the garment industry in El Segundo, California. Song becomes deeply involved with the workers and their plight – the search for a desperate promise of freedom. With her work, she discovers the power true freedom holds.	But her work and growing sense of the true power of freedom begins to tear at the budding love between Weston and Song. Meanwhile, the referendum Jack, Wynona, and Song fought so hard against has been defeated. There will be no gambling on the reservation. Jack organizes a rodeo to raise money for an investment deal for the reservation. Weston agrees to ride – on one condition. Jack gets the bull, Baby Face that killed Cody.The night before the rodeo, Weston finds a letter Song has written to the garment workers she is helping. “We are, every one of us, entitled to a life with dignity. To life with honor. There are those who would attempt to steal our dignity, to seize our honor. But it is only when we allow this deepest core of our being to be ripped from us that we become enslaved. Remember, you, too, have been touched by God.”The next morning, Weston leaves for the rodeo without her. At the rodeo, in an eerie replay of Cody’s accident, the bull throws Weston. Song nurses Weston back to health, but still torn between freedom's power and her growing love, Song knows she must ultimately choose. Several weeks later, with Weston well on his way to mending, Song and Olive host a dinner party at Snowy Moon to celebrate Weston’s recovery. Along with Zeb, Jack Deerstalker and Mad Bull are there to join in the festivities. But in the middle of the revelry, the phone rings: it’s Jenny Chang and it’s about the case of the immigrant workers.Song knows she must go.The next day, Weston drives her to the train station.Returning to the ranch, Weston, still suffering from his injuries, limps painfully to the corral, and saddles up his horse. He rides across the rolling plains to the waterfall where he and Song had spent so much time in happier times now long gone by. Watching the water tumble by like his lost hope, suddenly, Weston picks up a stone, and fires it into the tumultuous fall. He whistles for his horse, and throws himself into the saddle.Across the plains, the train continues to roll. Inside, an uproar arises among the passengers. Song forces her way to the window. Outside, riding like hell, is Weston.Song’s heart begins to pound.And suddenly, she knows….Finally, she knows.Song grabs her suitcase, and elbows her way through the crowd.Before the train fully stops, she is bounding from the platform…and rushing into Weston’s arms.",,,,June 21st 2017,[],Kindle Edition,,B072VR7W5S,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498165186l/35225043._SY475_.jpg,4.2,[],275.0,3.0,,,,99.0,148.0,,Solstice Publishing,"['56', '66', '25', '1', '0']",,[],,['Leigh Podgorski']

Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?: 23 Questions From Great Philosophers,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'History', 'Polish Literature', 'Theology', 'Spirituality']","Can nature make us happy? How can we know anything? What is justice? Why is there evil in the world? What is the source of truth? Is it possible for God not to exist? Can we really believe what we see? There are questions that have intrigued the world's great thinkers over the ages, which still touch a chord in all of us today. They are questions that can teach us about the way we live, work, relate to each other and see the world. Here Leszek Kolakowski explores the essence of these ideas, introducing figures from Socrates to Thomas Aquinas, Descartes to Nietzsche, and concentrating on one single important philosophical question from each of them. Whether reflecting on good and evil, truth and beauty, faith and the soul, or free will and consciousness, Leszek Kolakowski shows that these timeless ideas remain at the very core of our existence.",,,11/06/06,,[],,,9780713999259,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1189045073l/1839896._SY475_.jpg,3.71,[],80.0,1.0,,,,91.0,295.0,,,"['64', '115', '89', '19', '8']",,[],,['Leszek Kołakowski']

Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual's place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed War and Peace in the same category as the Iliad ""To read him . . . is to find one's way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.""",,,,1999.0,,,3895086908,9783895086908,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R1Y6SwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.11,,,,,,,,,1500.0,,,126.0,,,['Lev N.

Wolf Whistle,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Southern', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature', 'Race', 'Contemporary', 'American', 'Historical', 'Humor']","Born and raised in the Mississippi Delta, novelist Lewis Nordan was fifteen years old the summer two white men from the next town were tried for the murder of a black boy who wolf-whistled at a white woman. The boy's name was Emmett Till and the year his murderers were tried (and acquitted) was 1955. In the thirty-eight years since, that white adolescent's impressions of what happened in Money, Mississippi, have been turned over in Nordan's mind and memory. In the turning, those impressions have gathered the odd outgrowths and distortions of this writer's truly wild imagination. The outlines of real events have been subsumed into entirely new and different shapes. The result is Wolf Whistle, a novel starring a Mississippi white-trash girl named Alice who understands - in her heart - the meaning of evil. Alice is the fourth-grade teacher at the Arrow Catcher Elementary School and she yearns to teach her pupils things worth learning. She believes the best way to do it is with field trips. The first trip of the 1955 school year is to the bedside of the fourth-grader's terminally burned classmate, Glenn Gregg. (Glenn got in the way of a gasoline fire he set to burn up his despicable daddy.). The final trip is to be to the courthouse where Alice and her fourth grade class attend the murder trial of Glenn Gregg's despicable daddy, Solon, and his employer, Lord Montberclair, whose wife's beauty is what inspired a black teenager's reckless compliment (""Hubba, hubba""). In between those two educational forays, Nordan takes the reader on a field trip of his own - along the crooked paths of righteous racism and violence that lead to the courthouse gallery where the reader joins Alice and her fourth graders to witness the 1950s American Southern ethic at work. Soft heart turned ""bleeding heart,"" it is Alice in whom the germ of guilt recognition grows, matures, and bears fruit to pass on to future generations of white southerners. It is inside Alice's brilliant heart that Lewis Nordan has come of age as a novelist.",,,01/10/93,,[],Kindle Edition,,9781565121102,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328326733l/6588092.jpg,4.02,[],84.0,1.0,,,,93.0,957.0,,,"['351', '353', '187', '56', '10']",,[],,['Lewis Nordan']

I made it to the next moment. And that’s how you get through a bad moment of grief. You do it one moment at a time. —from Worth Fighting For LISA NIEMI and PATRICK SWAYZE were married for thirty-four years. They first met as teenagers at his mother’s dance studio—he was older and just a bit cocky; she was the beautiful waif who refused to worship the ground he walked on. Through the years their marriage strained under the pressures that many do, but it was always a uniquely passionate and creative partnership. When they first exchanged vows, Lisa promised to be with her husband “till death do us part.” But how many couples stop and think about what that truly means? Worth Fighting For is a remarkably candid look at what losing a partner really entails—how to care for him or her, how to make it through each day without falling into despair, and how to move forward in the second half of your life when the person you spent the first half with is gone. For the first time, Lisa Niemi Swayze shares the details of Patrick’s twenty-one-month battle with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, and she describes his last days, when she simply tried to keep him comfortable. She writes with heartbreaking honesty about her grief in the aftermath of Patrick’s death, and she openly discusses the challenges that the years without him have posed. While this is an emotionally honest and un-flinching depiction of illness and loss, it is also a hopeful and life-affirming exploration of the power of the human spirit. Lisa shows that no matter how dark the prospect of another day may seem, there are always reserves of strength to call upon. She writes, “I tell you, I am a different person now. One who has been thrown into the fire and forged.” Like The Year of Magical Thinking and A Widow’s Story, this book is both a tribute to a marriage and a celebration of the healing power that each day holds, even in the most difficult of circumstances.",,,12/31/11,January 3rd 2012,[],Hardcover,,9781439196359,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1324432761l/11968723.jpg,4.19,[],78.0,1.0,,,,95.0,1167.0,336,Atria Books,"['542', '385', '178', '48', '14']",,[],,['Lisa Niemi Swayze']

Why the Dreyfus Affair Matters,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'France', '19th Century', 'European History']","In December 1894, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a brilliant French artillery officer and a Jew of Alsatian descent, was court-martialed for selling secrets to the German military attaché in Paris based on perjured testimony and trumped-up evidence. The sentence was military degradation and life imprisonment on Devil’s Island, a hellhole off the coast of French Guiana. Five years later, the case was overturned, and eventually Dreyfus was completely exonerated. Meanwhile, the Dreyfus Affair tore France apart, pitting Dreyfusards—committed to restoring freedom and honor to an innocent man convicted of a crime committed by another—against nationalists, anti-Semites, and militarists who preferred having an innocent man rot to exposing the crimes committed by ministers of war and the army’s top brass in order to secure Dreyfus’s conviction.Was the Dreyfus Affair merely another instance of the rise in France of a virulent form of anti-Semitism?

Wit,,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'School', 'Medicine', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'Death', 'Read For School']","Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Lucille Lortel Award, and the Oppenheimer AwardMargaret Edson’s powerfully imagined Pulitzer Prize–winning play examines what makes life worth living through her exploration of one of existence’s unifying experiences—mortality—while she also probes the vital importance of human relationships. What we as her audience take away from this remarkable drama is a keener sense that, while death is real and unavoidable, our lives are ours to cherish or throw away—a lesson that can be both uplifting and redemptive. As the playwright herself puts it, “The play is not about doctors or even about cancer. It’s about kindness, but it shows arrogance. It’s about compassion, but it shows insensitivity.” In Wit, Edson delves into timeless questions with no final answers: How should we live our lives knowing that we will die? Is the way we live our lives and interact with others more important than what we achieve materially, professionally, or intellectually? How does language figure into our lives? Can science and art help us conquer death, or our fear of it? What will seem most important to each of us about life as that life comes to an end?The immediacy of the presentation, and the clarity and elegance of Edson’s writing, make this sophisticated, multilayered play accessible to almost any interested reader. As the play begins, Vivian Bearing, a renowned professor of English who has spent years studying and teaching the intricate, difficult Holy Sonnets of the seventeenth-century poet John Donne, is diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. Confident of her ability to stay in control of events, she brings to her illness the same intensely rational and painstakingly methodical approach that has guided her stellar academic career. But as her disease and its excruciatingly painful treatment inexorably progress, she begins to question the single-minded values and standards that have always directed her, finally coming to understand the aspects of life that make it truly worth living.

  Since the 1981 publication of Marilynne Robinson’s novel, Housekeeping—a stunning debut that was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize—she has built a sterling reputation not only as a writer of sharp, subtly moving prose, but also as a rigorous thinker and incisive essayist. Her compelling and demanding collection The Death of Adam—in which she reflected on her Presbyterian upbringing, investigated the roots of Midwestern abolitionism, and mounted a memorable defense of Calvinism—is respected as a classic of the genre, praised by Doris Lessing as “a useful antidote to the increasingly crude and slogan-loving culture we inhabit.” In this new collection she returns to the themes which have preoccupied her work: the role of faith in modern life, the inadequacy of fact, the contradictions inherent in human nature. Clear-eyed and forceful as ever, Robinson demonstrates once again why she is regarded as a modern rhetorical master.

Wilczy notes,,"['Russia', 'Nonfiction']","Debiut prozatorski Mariusza Wilka, mieszkającego od kilku lat na Sołowkach. Tematem jest współczesna Rosja, której wizerunek autor kreśli w sposób rzetelny i barwny zarazem. ""Na Sołowkach – pisze – widać Rosję, jak w kropli wody – morze"". Z okazji wydania Wilczego notesu Jerzy Giedroyc pisał: ""Mariusz Wilk rewelował się nie tylko jako świetny pisarz, ale też jako wyjątkowy znawca Rosji. Jego zapiski dają wnikliwy obraz współczesnej Rosji, jej kultury i tradycji"". Wilczy notes nie jest bowiem fikcją literacką, lecz relacją o zdarzeniach, których autor był świadkiem. Fabularyzowane fragmenty książki ujawniają jednak również talent powieściopisarski Wilka, wspaniałego stylisty. ""Uderza i zachwyca – pisał Jan Kott – jędrność, bogactwo i nade wszystko świeżość języka. W języku Wilka wiatr z północy przynosi i odnawia słowa"".

What Beauty,,[],"Minus Orth walks dogs for a living and sculpts for his life. He’s ready to create a unique sculpture cycle — Mythical Gods in Their Twilight. Meanwhile, he has a girlfriend, Belinda, who’s itching to get married. His friend, Peter N, has reaped artistic success that’s both inspirational and a thorn. He plays poker with a quartet of exiled aristocrats. And at Minus’s art co-op, the residents live on the fringe of society. One day Minus crosses paths with Karen Kosek, best remembered as a culture critic of the 1960s. Karen dropped out of sight years ago. Now she dresses as a bag lady — ragged clothes, a garbage smell, and bulging plastic bags she carries as if they hold the secrets to the good life. Minus orchestrates a tenuous relationship with Karen, and discovers in her a woman who has not been trampled underfoot, but is burrowed deeper in society’s crust than anyone could imagine.Thus begins an odyssey in which Minus becomes obsessed with Karen’s past and present, obsessed with creating his sculpture cycle, and with the role artists play in society’s split personality. “Do you have what it takes to make something beautiful?” is a question that comes to the minds of many characters in this story. Their answers are hilarious, confused, self-delusional, virtuous, or simply truthful, because the people who create beauty are different from those who value beauty, and far afield from the powers able to help it flourish … or destroy it.",,,05/13/12,June 15th 2012,[],Paperback,,9781470033835,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344762725l/15821325.jpg,4.0,[],98.0,1.0,,,,67.0,3.0,400,Siren & Muse Publishing,[],,[],,['Mark Beyer']

It has been ten years since twenty-one-year-old Charles MacKenzie Jr. (""Mack"") went missing. A Columbia University senior, about to graduate and already accepted at Duke University Law School, he walked out of his apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side without a word to his college roommates and has never been seen again. However, he does make one ritual phone call to his mother every year: on Mother's Day. Each time, he assures her he is fine, refuses to answer her frantic questions, then hangs up. Even the death of his father, a corporate lawyer, in the tragedy of 9/11 does not bring him home or break the pattern of his calls.Mack's sister, Carolyn, is now twenty-six, a law school graduate, and has just finished her clerkship for a civil court judge in Manhattan. She has endured two family tragedies, yet she realizes that she will never be able to have closure and get on with her life until she finds her brother. She resolves to discover what happened to Mack and why he has found it necessary to hide from them. So this year when Mack makes his annual Mother's Day call, Carolyn interrupts to announce her intention to track him down, no matter what it takes. The next morning after Mass, her uncle, Monsignor Devon MacKenzie, receives a scrawled message left in the collection basket: ""Uncle Devon, tell Carolyn she must not look for me.""Mack's cryptic warning does nothing to deter his sister from taking up the search, despite the angry reaction of her mother, Olivia, and the polite disapproval of Elliott Wallace, Carolyn's honorary uncle, who is clearly in love with Olivia.Carolyn's pursuit of the truth about Mack's disappearance swiftly plunges her into a world of unexpected danger and unanswered questions. What is the secret that Gus and Lil Kramer, the superintendents of the building in which Mack was living, have to hide? What do Mack's old roommates, the charismatic club owner Nick DeMarco and the cold and wealthy real estate tycoon Bruce Galbraith, know about Mack's disappearance? Is Nick connected to the disappearance of Leesey Andrews, who had last been seen in his trendy club? Can the police possibly believe that Mack is not only alive, but a serial killer, a shadowy predator of young women?

Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Neuroscience', 'Personal Development', 'Biology']","A New York Times bestseller The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert—Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab—reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.  An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.  Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, Why We Sleep is a crucial and illuminating book.",,1st edition,,October 3rd 2017,[],Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1556604137l/34466963._SY475_.jpg,4.38,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Science & Technology (2017)'],1025.0,11.0,,,,96.0,75964.0,368,Scribner,"['42854', '23068', '7275', '1656', '1111']",,[],,['Matthew Walker']

World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Apocalyptic', 'War']","The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",World War Z,,,09/12/06,"['Zombies', 'Kwang Jing-shu', 'Nury Televaldi', 'Stanley MacDonald', 'Todd Wainio', 'Maria Zhuganova', 'Jesika Hendricks', 'Joe Muhammad']",Hardcover,,9780307346605,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647l/8908._SX318_.jpg,4.01,"['Audie Award for Multi-Voiced Performance (2014)', 'Premio Ignotus Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera (Best Foreign Novel) (2009)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2012)', 'Seiun Award 星雲賞 Nominee for Best Translated Long Form (2011)']",17610.0,222.0,,,,92.0,439825.0,342,Crown,"['168192', '153281', '83042', '25068', '10242']",,[],,['Max Brooks']

H recalls when he himself was sixteen—his godson’s age—as they search for the site of H’s life-altering friendship with a boy named Finn. Finn lives alone on an isolated slip of land and follows no rules: he spends his days swimming, fishing, and collecting driftwood for his tiny beach hut. H, on the other hand, is an upper-class boarding school boy stifled by monotony and endless rules. They meet by chance on the beach, and H is immediately awed by (and jealous of) Finn’s way of life. They strike up an unlikely friendship but the gap between their lives becomes difficult to bridge, and before long the idyll that nurtured their relationship is shattered by heart-wrenching scandal.

It was the crisis that led her to reflect upon the incidents that had brought her to a place so incomprehensible. She was born the third of seven children to the beautiful actress Maureen O'Sullivan and successful writer/director John Farrow, but the isolation of a polio ward brought her childhood to an abrupt end at the age of nine. Several years later, two deaths shattered the security of the family forever, and Mia Farrow embarked upon a journey that would lead her away from the convent education that was to sustain her spiritual courage, to starring roles in Peyton Place and Rosemary's Baby, a marriage to Frank Sinatra, divorce, a defining trip to India, work on the London stage and in film, and marriage to Andre Previn.

When he awakes, the nightmare's grip still affects him to such a point, he can't tell the difference between the dream he was just having, and reality. Mickey knows every detail of his nightmare when he first awakes, but as time passes, and his heart and breathing slow, he has already forgotten most of the details. The overwhelming emotions he goes through from first awakening until he is fully awake is; terror, fear, confusion, then helplessness. What Mickey has just gone through is very rare, and still largely misunderstood. Mickey is suffering from ""Night Terrors"". A symptom of the ""Terrors"" is a continued, long-term memory of impossible danger, terrifying monsters, and strange situations, that seem so real, Mickey can swear that they aren't dreams. Mickey has been through three sleep studies to see if anything can be done to eliminate the terrors, or at least slow them down. What his body goes through---both physically and emotionally---is taking a toll. The doctors have a real fear that Mickey will suffer a heart attack, or stroke, or embolism during one of the more intense episodes. None of the suggestions the doctors have previously given him have worked; exercise, eliminating caffeine, taking medication, and even yoga, have helped. Lately, Mickey has begun to think of his dreams in an entirely new way. What if, instead of bad dreams, this is real? In his frazzled mind, this bizarre notion actually makes sense to him. What if he really is being attacked by monsters from other worlds and dimensions? Oddly, compared to what he is already going through, this new idea doesn't scare him.

Why I Love Black Women,,"['Nonfiction', 'African American']","Son and husband, soulmate and teacher, Michael Eric Dyson owes his success to the love and support of the black women in his life. Yet too often, he warns, African American women are the victims of negative stereotypes that dominate the larger culture and even many quarters of black America. It's time to stop viewing black women as scolding sapphires, welfare queens, professional prima donnas-and carping competitors with white women -and to start giving them the respect and the love they deserve. Why I Love Black Women is an act of cultural restoration that rescues black women from vicious rhetoric and irresponsible generalizations. It is a catalogue of virtues, an unapologetically cheerful view of black women that rescues their strengths and beauties from callous denial or cruel indifference. Deeply personal and socially provocative, Dyson singles out the defining virtues of African American women. More than a colored knock-off of ""vanilla"" virtues, these qualities evoke praise and conjure awe in the face of black women's struggles. In an era marred by bigoted and baleful beliefs about black women-from hip-hop to the pulpit, from the streets to scholarly focus-Dyson offers a welcome reprieve from cultural madness.

What Does God Want?,,['Theology'],"What does God want?  Sounds like a simple question, but if you give it a bit of thought, it’s really not. For starters, you have to know who’s asking the question. People will ask it for a lot of different reasons. It’s pretty obvious that the question is a religious one. Questions about God naturally get filed in that folder.  If you’ve spent a lot of your life in church, you might think you already know the answer. You might know parts of it, but I can guarantee you’ll see a lot that’s new here. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill “Christianity 101” book. Unfortunately, the thing that most often gets in the way of the wonder of the story is religion, and that isn’t what this book offers. And if you’ve never been in a church or heard much about the Bible, don’t worry. You’ve got nothing to unlearn or re-learn. It’s all fresh. That makes you an ideal reader.  So what does God want? Best-selling author, Dr. Michael S. Heiser, shows readers that the answer is pretty simple. God wants YOU. That might surprise you. You may doubt it. That’s okay. But it’s the right answer. But it isn’t enough of an answer. You can’t get a sense of how amazing and profound the answer is by just that one sentence. There’s actually a long, remarkable story behind the answer—one that isn’t well known by most people interested in the question.",,,,October 31st 2018,[],Kindle Edition,,B07K31MS5M,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541236118l/42617841._SX318_.jpg,4.69,[],67.0,1.0,,,,98.0,244.0,106,Blind Spot Press,"['187', '43', '10', '3', '1']",,[],,['Michael S.

Otwierały się tylko na „specjalne” okazje by uwięzić wszelkie pomioty zła. Królewna, mając tak ogromny potencjał złych mocy, siała prawdziwy postrach i nic dziwnego, że świadoma swojej władzy zaczęła podbijać sąsiednie krainy. Był jednak pewien mankament. Wrota potrafiły działać bez zgody swojej pani, przejmując niekiedy całkowicie władzę nad jej umysłem i ciałem. Stąd był już tylko krok do opętania, a łatwo się domyślić, co może się stać z krainą rządzoną przez opętaną czarownicę.Powieść Mileny Wójtowicz nosi wszelkie znamiona bajki. Ale jest to wyjątkowo przewrotna bajka. Królewna wcale nie jest piękna, jej największym zagrożeniem nie są obcy wojownicy, lecz egzorcyści, i nawet żaba podająca się za księcia tak naprawdę jest tylko zaczarowanym pastuchem.

  New York Times
   bestselling book 
  Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? 
  and the creator and star of 
  The Mindy Project
   comes a collection of essays that are as hilarious and insightful as they are deeply personal.
  In Why Not Me?,  Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it's falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you're constantly reminded that no one looks like you.  In ""How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet's Confessions"", Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, (""Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn't the land of appropriate-this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman s traditional hair color is honey blonde."") ""Player"" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (""I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs."") In ""Unlikely Leading Lady"", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses, (""Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture."") And in ""Soup Snakes"", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak (""I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell."")  Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to.

What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for the 100 Percent Gold Dollar,,"['Economics', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'Money', 'Government', 'Political Science']","The Mises Institute is pleased to present this very beautiful hardbound edition of Rothbard's most famous monetary essay--the one that has influenced two generations of economists, investors, and business professionals. The Mises Institute has united this book with its natural complement: a detailed reform proposal for a 100 percent gold dollar. The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar was written a decade before the last vestiges of the gold standard were abolished. His unique plan for making the dollar sound again still holds up. Some people have said: Rothbard tells us what is wrong with money but not what to do about it. Well, by adding this essay, the problem and the answer are united in a comprehensive whole. After presenting the basics of money and banking theory, he traces the decline of the dollar from the 18th century to the present, and provides lucid critiques of central banking, New Deal monetary policy, Nixonian fiat money, and fixed exchange rates. He also provides a blueprint for a return to a 100 percent reserve gold standard. The book made huge theoretical advances. He was the first to prove that the government, and only the government, can destroy money on a mass scale, and he showed exactly how they go about this dirty deed. But just as importantly, it is beautifully written. He tells a thrilling story because he loves the subject so much. The passion that Murray feels for the topic comes through in the prose and transfers to the reader. Readers become excited about the subject, and tell others. Students tell professors. Some, like the great Ron Paul of Texas, have even run for political office after having read it. Rothbard shows precisely how banks create money out of thin air and how the central bank, backed by government power, allows them to get away with it. He shows how exchange rates and interest rates would work in a true free market. When it comes to describing the end of the gold standard, he is not content to describe the big trends. He names names and ferrets out all the interest groups involved. Since Rothbard's death, scholars have worked to assess his legacy, and many of them agree that this little book is one of his most important. Though it has sometimes been inauspiciously packaged and is surprisingly short, its argument took huge strides toward explaining that it is impossible to understand public affairs in our time without understanding money and its destruction.",,,11/06/63,September 20th 2005,[],Hardcover,,9780945466444,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1285008975l/81977.jpg,4.26,[],54.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2634.0,191,Ludwig von Mises Institute,"['1333', '837', '325', '88', '51']",,[],,['Murray N.

What They Asked Me: The Fear of Living and Dying Young,,[],"This small book was written by Mr. Mwanandeke Kindembo. The author focused on answering some crucial questions asked by different people. Therefore, he decided to combine all the minds into One by giving general answers upon each question posed. These answers are his own opinions based upon what he experienced in life. In other words, “feel think” instead of “think feel”. These answers were provided to act as motivational as well as illuminating the minds instead of arousing only. It is unknown whether he is a naturalist, idealist or realist. But the answers seem to offer that first-hand experience instead of mere facts that doesn’t lead anywhere. It’s given therefore upon the reader to decide on his/her own conclusion of this little book of questionnaires. Instead of focusing on the famous sentence “arise, ye who are dead”.

Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Business', 'Film', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Art', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']","From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of ""Walt Disney's America."" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",,,,October 31st 2006,['Walt Disney'],Hardcover,,9780679438229,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353778664l/118824.jpg,4.06,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (2006)'],93.0,1.0,,,,91.0,8814.0,851,Alfred A.

  From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nelson DeMille comes a suspenseful new novel featuring Detective John Corey and an all-too-plausible conspiracy to detonate a nuclear bomb in two major American cities.
Welcome to the Custer Hill Club--an informal men's club set in a luxurious Adirondack hunting lodge whose members include some of America's most powerful business leaders, military men, and government officials. Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics. But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate. Their plan is finalized and set into motion. That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing. His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve. The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts. As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire. 
  Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.

He comes from the Left. When he was a child, his mother would search supermarket shelves for politically reputable citrus fruit, and despair. Aged 13, when he learned his kind and thoughtful English teacher voted Conservative, he nearly fell off his chair: 'To be good, you had to be on the Left.' Today he's no less confused. When he looks around him, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, he sees a community of Left-leaning liberals standing on their heads. Why do apologies for a militant Islam standing for everything the liberal-Left is against come from a section of it? After the US/UK wars in Bosnia and Kosovo against Milosevic's ethnic cleansers, why were some on the Left denying the existence of Serb concentration camps? Why is Palestine a cause for the liberal-Left, but not, for instance, China, the Sudan, Zimbabwe or North Korea? Why can't those who say they support the Palestinian cause tell you what type of Palestine they'd like to see? After the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC, why were you as likely to read that a conspiracy of Jews controlled US or UK foreign policy in a liberal literary journal as in a neo-Nazi rag? It's easy to know what the Left is fighting against--the evils of Bush and corporations--but what and who are they fighting for? As he tours the follies of the Left, he asks us to reconsider what it means to be liberal today. With the angry satire of Swift, he reclaims the values of democracy and solidarity that united the movement against fascism, asking: What's Left?.",,1st Edition,,2007,"['George W.

Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Unfinished', 'Own', 'History']","It all started when Douglas Adams demolished planet Earth in order to make way for an intergalactic expressway–and then invited everyone to thumb a ride on a comical cosmic road trip with the likes of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the other daft denizens of deep space immortalized in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book “trilogy” that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you’ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you’ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python’s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic; and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat–while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration– a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject’s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust.

William Faulkner,The Sound and the Fury ; As I Lay Dying,Literary Criticism,"This book explores the puzzling phenomenon of new veiling practices among lower middle class women in Cairo, Egypt. Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women's protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.",,,,1999.0,,,023112189X,9780231121897,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3_DKH4sX-4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.96,,,,,,,,,192.0,,,4.0,,,['Nicolas Tredell']

What Is to Be Done?,,"['Fiction', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Novels', '19th Century', 'Russian History']","""No work in modern literature, with the possible exception of Uncle Tom's Cabin, can compete with What Is to Be Done? in its effect on human lives and its power to make history. For Chernyshevsky's novel, far more than Marx's Capital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution.""--Joseph Frank, The Southern ReviewAlmost from the moment of its publication in 1863, Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done?, had a profound impact on the course of Russian literature and politics. The idealized image it offered of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals transforming society by means of scientific knowledge served as a model of inspiration for Russia's revolutionary intelligentsia. On the one hand, the novel's condemnation of moderate reform helped to bring about the irrevocable break between radical intellectuals and liberal reformers; on the other, Chernyshevsky's socialist vision polarized conservatives' opposition to institutional reform. Lenin himself called Chernyshevsky ""the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx""; and the controversy surrounding What Is to Be Done? exacerbated the conflicts that eventually led to the Russian Revolution.Michael R. Katz's readable and compelling translation is now the definitive unabridged English-language version, brilliantly capturing the extraordinary qualities of the original. William G. Wagner has provided full annotations to Chernyshevsky's allusions and references and to the, sources of his ideas, and has appended a critical bibliography. An introduction by Katz and Wagner places the novel in the context of nineteenth-century Russian social, political, and intellectual history and literature, and explores its importance for several generations of Russian radicals.",,,10/30/63,January 1st 1989,[],Paperback,,9780801495472,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348353496l/178196.jpg,3.44,[],95.0,1.0,,,,78.0,2029.0,445,Cornell University Press,"['502', '513', '569', '263', '182']",,[],,"['Nikolai Chernyshevsky', 'Michael R.

Walking Naked,,"['Fiction', 'British Literature']","Laura is happily married, a mother, and a successful novelist. Although prey to night terrors, she is adept at smoothing the disorder of reality into controlled prose. Interweaving memory, conversation, and reflection, Walking Naked telescopes the whole of Laura's life—childhood, marriages, triumphs, and disappointments—into a day in which the past and the present converge. It begins with a game of tennis played for duty rather than amusement and progresses, via an afternoon party of old friends and jaded emotions, to a bewildering visit to Laura's son, who is imprisoned on a drugs charge. At its close, the possibility of death within the family brings unresolved conflicts to center stage, and Laura strips herself of the posturing and self-deceit with which she has cloaked her vulnerability.

In these lectures, he presents a lifetime of philosophical reflection on all three of these areas of research, to which he has contributed for over half a century.In clear, precise, and nontechnical language, Chomsky elaborates on fifty years of scientific development in the study of language, sketching how his own work has implications for the origins of language, the close relations that language bears to thought, and its eventual biological basis. He expounds and criticizes many alternative theories, such as those that emphasize the social, the communicative, and the referential aspects of language. Chomsky reviews how new discoveries about language overcome what seemed to be highly problematic assumptions in the past. He also investigates the apparent scope and limits of human cognitive capacities and what the human mind can seriously investigate, in the light of history of science and philosophical reflection and current understanding. Moving from language and mind to society and politics, he concludes with a searching exploration and philosophical defense of a position he describes as ""libertarian socialism,"" tracing its links to anarchism and the ideas of John Dewey and even to the ideas of Marx and Mill, demonstrating its conceptual growth out of our historical past and urgent relation to matters of the present.",,,,December 15th 2015,[],Hardcover,,9780231175968,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444892866l/26263022.jpg,3.73,[],100.0,1.0,,,,89.0,696.0,200,Columbia University Press,"['169', '264', '187', '61', '15']",,[],,['Noam Chomsky']

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'""

"Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide",,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Africa', 'Memoir', 'Animals', 'Adventure', 'Humor', 'Biography', 'Nature', 'Botswana']","A hilarious, highly original collection of essays based on the Botswana truism: “only food runs!”In the tradition of Bill Bryson, a new writer brings us the lively adventures and biting wit of an African safari guide. Peter Allison gives us the guide’s-eye view of living in the bush, confronting the world’s fiercest terrain of wild animals and, most challenging of all, managing herds of gaping tourists. Passionate for the animals of the Kalahari, Allison works as a top safari guide in the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta. As he serves the whims of his wealthy clients, he often has to stop the impulse to run as far away from them as he can, as these tourists are sometimes more dangerous than a pride of lions. No one could make up these outrageous-but-true tales: the young woman who rejected the recommended safari-friendly khaki to wear a more “fashionable” hot pink ensemble; the lost tourist who happened to be drunk, half-naked, and a member of the British royal family; establishing a real friendship with the continent’s most vicious animal; the Japanese tourist who requested a repeat performance of Allison’s being charged by a lion so he could videotape it; and spending a crazy night in the wild after blowing a tire on a tour bus, revealing that Allison has as much good-natured scorn for himself. The author’s humor is exceeded only by his love and respect for the animals, and his goal is to limit any negative exposure to humans by planning trips that are minimally invasive—unfortunately it doesn’t always work out that way! Peter Allison is originally from Sydney, Australia. His safaris have been featured in National Geographic, Conde Nast Traveler, and on television programs such as Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures. He travels frequently to speaking appearances, and splits most of his time between Botswana, Sydney, and San Francisco.",,,10/30/07,October 1st 2007,[],Paperback,,9780762745654,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328814881l/891224.jpg,3.98,[],99.0,1.0,,,,94.0,8802.0,246,Lyons Press,"['2847', '3543', '1919', '393', '100']",,[],,['Peter Allison']

We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families,Stories From Rwanda,History,"An unforgettable firsthand account of a people's response to genocide and what it tells us about humanity. This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda's ""genocidal logic"" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.

What's So Amazing About Grace?,,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Inspirational']","Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656In 1987, an IRA bomb buried Gordon Wilson and his twenty-year-old daughter beneath five feet of rubble. Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers, ' I have lost my daughter, but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray, tonight and every night, that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears  and out of one man's grief, the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate, and the one thing it craves above all else  for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. In What's So Amazing About Grace? award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images, tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin, says Yancey, but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking, scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse, the racist, the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. In his most personal and provocative book ever, Yancey offers compelling, true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks, How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know, What's So Amazing About Grace?",,Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656,01/01/97,February 17th 2002,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328050483l/53817.jpg,4.16,['ECPA Christian Book Award for Christian Book of the Year (1998)'],240.0,3.0,,,,93.0,37816.0,304,Zondervan,"['17902', '11833', '5451', '1489', '1141']",,[],,['Philip Yancey']

Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'Physics', 'Comedy', 'Popular Science', 'Comics', 'Adult', 'Reference']","Randall Munroe left NASA in 2005 to start up his hugely popular site XKCD 'a web comic of romance, sarcasm, math and language' which offers a witty take on the world of science and geeks. It now has 600,000 to a million page hits daily. Every now and then, Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate. 'My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning, and we agreed that you should resolve it . . . ' He liked these questions so much that he started up What If. If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide, how long would you survive? How dangerous is it, really, to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm? If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms, how much power could we produce? What if everyone only had one soulmate?When (if ever) did the sun go down on the British empire?  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?What would happen if the moon went away?In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, studded with memorable cartoons and infographics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion.

The Soviet Union had lost the heart of its industry, and the United States was not yet armed.The Allied victory in 1945 was not inevitable.

He recounts the decisive campaigns: the war at sea, the crucial battles on the eastern front, the air war, and the vast amphibious assault on Europe.

Instead, the diseases we fear--and the ones that plague us now--are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way--through fighting or fleeing.

When We Ruled: The Ancient and Medieval History of Black Civilisations,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'Race', 'Ancient History', 'History and Politics']","When We Ruled is by far the best general work on the ancient and medieval history of Black people there has ever been.This landmark publication, which is superbly illustrated with high quality photographs, maps and drawings, provides an extraordinary and cutting-edge synthesis of the archaeological data, the documentary evidence, and the historical linguistic research. It recounts the fascinating story of the origin and development of indigenous civilisations across the vast panorama of the African continent.In particular, the author answers the key question in Black history: How much documented history is there beyond the Slave Trade, Mary Seacole, and Malcolm X? In 713 pages that question is answered again and again with a vast array of evidence that explodes the widely held view that Africans were without historical distinctions. In particular, there are ancient and medieval monuments that are still standing all over Africa. In addition, there are Black families and institutions that still possess their medieval manuscripts.The history of Black people cannot be divorced from the history of peoples on other continents particularly Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Topic areas that have traditionally been ignored, such as Black Women's history, early African science and technology, and the two-way influences between Africa and Europe, are also discussed.What is remarkable about this work is that for the first time it dares to connect Egypt, and its cultural affinities, with Africa and its chronological timeline within the vast chronology (nearly 90,000 years) of African achievement. It is now untenable for Egyptologists to consider themselves to be experts on Egypt without understanding the African cultural signature embedded within Ancient Egypt and its long history.Faculty, students and parents interested in a comprehensive, critical and balanced overview of African or Black history will find no better book.",,,,2006,[],Hardcover,,9780955106804,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330280618l/2858266.jpg,4.44,[],99.0,1.0,,,,93.0,168.0,713,Every Generation Media,"['115', '30', '12', '4', '7']",,[],,"['Robin Walker', 'Fari Supiya']"

Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.When it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.",,,01/01/00,October 9th 2001,[],Paperback,,9780375758256,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435292091l/10669._SY475_.jpg,4.2,[],189.0,3.0,,,,97.0,23191.0,264,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['9842', '9134', '3421', '552', '242']",,[],,['Roger Lowenstein']

Can literature, in fact, be political at all? These are the questions Roland Barthes addresses in Writing Degree Zero, his first published book and a landmark in his oeuvre. The debate had engaged the European literary community since the 1930s; with this fierce manifesto, Barthes challenged the notion of literature's obligation to be socially committed. Yes, Barthes allows, the writer has a political and ethical responsibility. But the history of French literature shows that the writer has often failed to meet it—and from his perspective, literature is committed to little more than the myth of itself.

Weapon,,[],"
  In the world of the living and the dead, only the dead survive…
  

  
The way carbon atoms need intense heat and pressure to change structure and become a diamond is the same way some girls need mind mapping and genetic modification to become unstoppable weapons. As in love, nothing comes easy. And nothing in life will ever be the same again. Such is the nature of cause and effect in genetics. 
  
In the wake of an horrific, inevitable tragedy, everyone is forced to be someone they’re not. Brayden sinks into the Vegas nightlife learning hard lessons in love and sex; Georgia struggles to cope with the mutant changes taking place in her, specifically the death of her emotions; Dr. Holland must correct his own genetic cocktail lest he descend into a madness more reminiscent of his earlier, more homicidal days; and Margaret and Christian must face their own dire truths, not only about who they are becoming as a couple, but if they will even have a family once the truth about Abby comes out.
  
Weapon is very much a book of love and humanity, the will to endure the unthinkable, the necessity of friendship in the darkest of times and what it means to prepare yourself for the backlash of a reckless life. When love is a choice, and life is a choice, but madness and torture head toward secrecy and conspiracy, what you have is a riveting tale that begs the question: can normalcy and paranormal power co-exist? Especially if that power is otherworldly and indomitable, something most humans could never comprehend? With some slight of hand, a rash of deception, and some life-threatening choices that seem impossible in retrospect, the heart-stopping fifth novel in the ground-breaking Swann Series begins. 
  
Note to Reader: Before you purchase this book, read the short author interview below. Due to mature content, Weapon is recommended for ages 15 and up.
  

  INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR
 
  
 
  Q – The events in Masochist flip the script, so to speak. Can we expect to see Abby again?
A – If I’ve learned one thing from reading over a thousand books, it’s that you want to keep your audience on edge. You want to be unpredictable, do the unthinkable. Nothing for my characters is easy. Weapon is no different. As the series progresses, the stakes intensify; if the characters can’t keep up, failure overwhelms them. Failure sometimes equals death. Weapon continues the Swann Series tradition by being a story of ascension. Over the last three books, this series has delicately embraced the paranormal, the genetically complex, the downright insane. So will we see Abby again? Maybe more than you think, or perhaps not at all. I can promise you this, what lie ahead…you will never see it coming.
  

  Q – You use Dulce Air Force Base as a background for Weapon. What inspired this setting?
A – There’s so much conspiracy surrounding Dulce AFB, especially in 1979 when a war broke out between the military and, well…something else. Sixty-seven military personnel died; three survived. Phil Schneider, grievously wounded, survived. His wounds were consistent with his story, but his story was impossible to the logical mind. Schneider was told the only way to avoid being suicided was to tell the truth to as many people as he could, a common safety measure for whistle-blowers. Schneider was later found dead in his apartment after thirteen murder attempts.",Swann Series #5,,,January 1st 2017,[],Kindle Edition,,B01N1JLENO,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1483746721l/33809003._SY475_.jpg,4.6,[],98.0,1.0,,,,96.0,25.0,495,River City Publishing,"['17', '7', '0', '1', '0']",,[],,['Ryan Schow']

Paretsky traces the emergence of V I Warshawski from the shadows of the loner detectives that stalk the mean streets of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler’s novels, and in the process explores American individualism, the failure of the American dream and the resulting dystopia.Both memoir and meditation, Writing in an Age of Silence is a beautiful, compelling exploration of the writer’s art and daunting responsibility in the face of the assault on US civil liberties post-9/11.",,,,May 17th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781844671229,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374000307l/50664.jpg,3.9,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2007)'],96.0,1.0,,,,91.0,307.0,138,Verso,"['97', '116', '65', '24', '5']",,[],,['Sara Paretsky']

Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective,,"['LGBT', 'Nonfiction']","Get a global perspective on bisexuality from a women's viewpoint!Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective reflects the growing contribution bisexuals, and especially bisexual women, make to queer culture on an international level. This unique book presents a collection of thoughtful essays, studies, and reviews that combine to help develop a language that reflects the reality of bisexuality from a feminine/feminist viewpoint. Authors map the inroads made by bisexual studies into conventional disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, health, literature, film, history, and biography, and analyze the situations of bisexual women in areas as diverse as France, North America, Germany, Australia, and Africa.The rich and varied contributions to Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective track the spread of bisexuality from the urban and metropolitan centers of gay culture to more peripheral areas as the movement becomes more and more hospitable to transnational and transcultural people. The book's main themes--bisexuality's ability to disrupt categories and the resulting feeling of alienation many bisexuals experience--are manifested in approaches that include critical theory, deconstruction, textual analysis, cognitive psychology, personal essay, review essay, reportage, and qualitative study. Topics addressed include:the impact of feminism and women's communities on the appearance of bisexual womenmulti-sexual relationships as border existence in Australiaa South African perspective on bisexualityunderstanding bisexuality's invisibilityLillian Hellmann's bisexual fantasiesand much more!Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective follows bisexuality to the crossroads of academics and activism, presenting a wide scope of refreshing and insightful thought that reflects more than an identity or practice.

Starting with a close examination of his own belief in Hinduism, he ranges far and wide in his study of the faith. He talks about the Great Souls of Hinduism, Adi Shankara, Patanjali, Ramanuja, Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and many others who made major contributions to the essence of Hinduism. He delves deep into Hinduism’s most important schools of thought (such as the Advaita Vedanta). He explains, in easily accessible language, important aspects and concepts of Hindu philosophy like the Purusharthas and Bhakti, masterfully summarizes the lessons of the Gita and Vivekananda’s ecumenism, and explores with sympathy the ‘Hinduism of habit’ practised by ordinary believers. He looks at the myriad manifestations of political Hinduism in the modern era, including violence committed in the name of the faith by right-wing organizations and their adherents. He analyzes Hindutva, explains its rise and dwells at length on the philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, its most significant ideologue. He is unsparing in his criticism of extremist ‘bhakts’, and unequivocal in his belief that everything that makes India a great and distinctive culture and country will be imperiled if religious ‘fundamentalists’ are allowed to take the upper hand. However, he also makes the point that it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.A book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu is a revelatory and original masterwork.",,,01/06/18,January 19th 2018,[],Paperback,,9789386021106,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515038439l/37810456._SX318_.jpg,3.73,[],93.0,1.0,,,,90.0,2214.0,302,Aleph Books,"['494', '910', '586', '157', '67']",,[],,['Shashi Tharoor']

Swathed in a thick veil of fog, with but a few old trees looming above, the island appeared desolated and dead.An overwhelming sense of despair crept behind my neck as we reached the shore. Thousands of men, women, and children had been condemned to live the last of their days here, infected by the plague. Dragged away from their homes, here, they suffered their agonizing illness, shunned by society, exiled from everything they knew and held dear.”Fans of Anne Rice and Cassandra Clare will love The Unnatural Brethren series!Praise for Written in Blood: Where do I start? It's gonna be a challenge, I want to gush a fountain of spoilers! This book should be filed away under ""Guilty Pleasures."" Our hero, Ivan, is a field of wild oats, begging to be sown. While his sister Alisa is the calm and the storm.There were so many minor characters with unforgettable personalities, I found myself getting attached to every new person that popped up. (Except one, he knows who he is, and take it from me, he had it coming)The writing style is solid. The author's style was passionate and fast-paced, I sailed through this book... partly because of the pace, and partly because the drama and intrigue kept me hooked all the way through.I especially appreciated all of the traveling in this book. I enjoyed taking a tour of London, Paris, and Venice all from the comfort of my couch.☆☆☆☆☆, I loved this book! Now if you'll excuse me, I have a sequel to buy.--Ivan Lockhart is the definition of a romantic anti-hero. His heart is the right place, his life is a constant strife to do the right thing, yet circumstances have shaped him into something he abhors.There's a sense of cruel fate that haunts him. Even as a child, surviving death becomes a curse of sorts, and, in his need to be loved and accepted, he forges unconventional relationships, dragging those who hold near and dear into his dark world. And this all happens before the supernatural even shows up in this story.--An amazing read from an amazing author. I love how she combines the paranormal with the historical.

Yet he came to believe that the wars in which he and his men had fought and bled and died were all pre-planned conflicts, designed not so much to defend America as to bloat the balance sheets of US banks and corporations.War Is a Racket is the title of two works, a speech and a booklet, by retired United States Marine Corps Major General and two time Medal of Honor recipient Smedley D. Butler. In them, Butler frankly discusses from his experience as a career military officer how business interests commercially benefit from warfare.After his retirement from the Marine Corps, Gen. Butler made a nationwide tour in the early 1930s giving his speech ""War is a Racket"". The speech was so well received that he wrote a longer version as a small book with the same title that was published in 1935 by Round Table Press, Inc., of New York. The booklet was also condensed in Reader's Digest as a book supplement which helped popularize his message.

Wesley the Owl: The Remarkable Love Story of an Owl and His Girl,,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Nature', 'Science', 'Biography', 'Birds', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']","When biologist Stacey O'Brien first met a four-day-old baby barn owl with nerve damage in one wing, she knew he had no hope of surviving on his own in the wild, so gave him a permanent home living with her. This is the funny, poignant story of their two decades together.On Valentine's Day 1985, biologist Stacey O'Brien first met a four-day-old baby barn owl -- a fateful encounter that would turn into an astonishing 19-year saga. With nerve damage in one wing, the owlet's ability to fly was forever compromised, and he had no hope of surviving on his own in the wild. O'Brien, a young assistant in the owl laboratory at Caltech, was immediately smitten, promising to care for the helpless owlet and give him a permanent home. Wesley the Owl is the funny, poignant story of their dramatic two decades together. With both a tender heart and a scientist's eye, O'Brien studied Wesley's strange habits intensively and first-hand -- and provided a mice-only diet that required her to buy the rodents in bulk (28,000 over the owl's lifetime). As Wesley grew, she snapped photos of him at every stage like any proud parent, recording his life from a helpless ball of fuzz to a playful, clumsy adolescent to a gorgeous, gold-and-white, macho adult owl with a heart-shaped face and an outsize personality that belied his 18-inch stature. Stacey and Wesley's bond deepened as she discovered Wesley's individual personality, subtle emotions, and playful nature that could also turn fiercely loyal and protective -- though she could have done without Wesley's driving away her would-be human suitors! O'Brien also brings us inside the prestigious research community, a kind of scientific Hogwarts where resident owls sometimes flew freely from office to office and eccentric, brilliant scientists were extraordinarily committed to studying and helping animals; all of them were changed by the animal they loved. As O'Brien gets close to Wesley, she makes important discoveries about owl behavior, intelligence, and communication, coining the term ""The Way of the Owl"" to describe his inclinations: he did not tolerate lies, held her to her promises, and provided unconditional love, though he was not beyond an occasional sulk. When O'Brien develops her own life-threatening illness, the biologist who saved the life of a helpless baby bird is herself rescued from death by the insistent love and courage of this wild animal. Enhanced by wonderful photos, Wesley the Owl is a thoroughly engaging, heartwarming, often funny story of a complex, emotional, non-human being capable of reason, play, and, most important, love and loyalty. It is sure to be cherished by animal lovers everywhere.",,,,August 19th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9781416551737,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431654592l/3001512._SY475_.jpg,4.12,[],275.0,3.0,,,,95.0,9674.0,230,Free Press,"['4001', '3422', '1752', '381', '118']",,[],,"[""Stacey O'Brien""]"

Women R Stupid & Men R The Reason,,[],"For centuries men and women have been at each others throats about who is right and who is wrong. We end up blaming each other for our struggles and failures because we as people just don't get ""it"". How many times are we going to be blind about our own inconsistencies, insecurities and misfortunes in life despite having 20/20 vision? The violence worldwide has gotten out of control especially in our inner cities and at the end of the day it's most likely because of something foolish like: hating on someone, lack of finances, or losing touch with the more important things in life. We no longer listen to each other nor do we communicate effectively. We live in a society where settling and playing our position is accepted but why? When was it ever cool to be someone's ""Baby Daddy or Mama""? When was it okay to be ""Boyfriend or Girlfriend #2""? Why don't young men and women dread the word marriage? How do people get over bridges? When is it a good time to start dating again after suffering heartbreak? Why are people not taking responsibilities for their own actions? What if there was a book talking about overcoming failures, bad decisions and falling down? What if you could take a journey through the head of a bachelor who has seen it and all and done it all? I have a hidden agenda. I want people to know that everything from love to friendships can be solved by looking at yourself in the mirror first and then trying to ""save"" the world. Throughout this book I will try my best to dig deep and then dig even deeper not just with the topic of relationships but life in general from being who you want to be and not what people want you to be. From throwing away your past to getting rids of the R.A.A.T.s in your life and even visiting a place where our society needs to shut down for good ""Little N***A University"". We have all lost touch of why we were put on this earth.

Comparing her experience to the formative processes inside a chrysalis on a wintry tree branch, Kidd reflects on the fact that the soul is often symbolized as a butterfly. The simple cocoon, a living parable of waiting, becomes an icon of hope for the transformation that the author sought. Kidd charts her re–ascent from the depths and offers a new understanding of the passage away from the self, which is based upon others' expectations, to the true self of God's unfolding intention.

"Without You, There Is No Us: My Time with the Sons of North Korea's Elite",,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Asia', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Asian Literature']","A haunting memoir of teaching English to the sons of North Korea's ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il's reignEvery day, three times a day, the students march in two straight lines, singing praises to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: Without you, there is no motherland. Without you, there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime. Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them, everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins.

When he arrives he's scared and angry, exploding at the least thing, and quick to flee.

Years of investigation have produced intriguing answers—and even more perplexing questions. But the truth is closer than ever before when a second robot, more massive than the first, materializes and lashes out with deadly force. Now humankind faces a nightmare invasion scenario made real, as more colossal machines touch down across the globe. But Rose and her team at the Earth Defense Corps refuse to surrender.

Works of Love,,"['Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Unfinished', 'Denmark', 'Classics']","The various kinds and conditions of love are a common theme for Kierkegaard, beginning with his early Either/Or, through ""The Diary of the Seducer"" and Judge William's eulogy on married love, to his last work, on the changelessness of God's love. Works of Love, the midpoint in the series, is also the monumental high point, because of its penetrating, illuminating analysis of the forms and sources of love. Love as feeling and mood is distinguished from works of love, love of the lovable from love of the unlovely, preferential love from love as the royal law, love as mutual egotism from triangular love, and erotic love from self-giving love.This work is marked by Kierkegaard's Socratic awareness of the reader, both as the center of awakened understanding and as the initiator of action. Written to be read aloud, the book conveys a keenness of thought and an insightful, poetic imagination that make such an attentive approach richly rewarding. Works of Love not only serves as an excellent place to begin exploring the writings of Kierkegaard, but also rewards many rereadings.",,Kierkegaard's Writings #16,09/29/47,March 23rd 1998,[],Paperback,,9780691059167,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388373530l/83324.jpg,4.36,[],71.0,1.0,,,,97.0,1619.0,576,Princeton University Press,"['893', '487', '186', '41', '12']",,[],,"['Søren Kierkegaard', 'Howard Vincent Hong', 'Edna Hatlestad Hong )']"
Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition,,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Nutrition', 'Food', 'Science', 'Vegan', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Reference', 'Diets']","What happens when you eat an apple? The answer is vastly more complex than you imagine.Every apple contains thousands of antioxidants whose names, beyond a few like vitamin C, are unfamiliar to us, and each of these powerful chemicals has the potential to play an important role in supporting our health. They impact thousands upon thousands of metabolic reactions inside the human body. But calculating the specific influence of each of these chemicals isn’t nearly sufficient to explain the effect of the apple as a whole. Because almost every chemical can affect every other chemical, there is an almost infinite number of possible biological consequences.And that’s just from an apple.Nutritional science, long stuck in a reductionist mindset, is at the cusp of a revolution. The traditional ""gold standard” of nutrition research has been to study one chemical at a time in an attempt to determine its particular impact on the human body. These sorts of studies are helpful to food companies trying to prove there is a chemical in milk or pre-packaged dinners that is ""good” for us, but they provide little insight into the complexity of what actually happens in our bodies or how those chemicals contribute to our health.In The China Study, T. Colin Campbell (alongside his son, Thomas M. Campbell) revolutionized the way we think about our food with the evidence that a whole food, plant-based diet is the healthiest way to eat. Now, in Whole, he explains the science behind that evidence, the ways our current scientific paradigm ignores the fascinating complexity of the human body, and why, if we have such overwhelming evidence that everything we think we know about nutrition is wrong, our eating habits haven’t changed.Whole is an eye-opening, paradigm-changing journey through cutting-edge thinking on nutrition, a scientific tour de force with powerful implications for our health and for our world.",,,,May 7th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9781937856243,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379393042l/13587039.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Food & Cookbooks (2013)'],97.0,1.0,,,,90.0,5150.0,352,BenBella Books,"['1826', '1695', '1130', '372', '127']",,[],,"['T.

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them—for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say.In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword—to invoke within himself something more noble.

Who Killed the Constitution?: The Assault on American Law and the Unmaking of a Nation,,"['Politics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Law', 'Political Science', 'American', 'Government']","“Let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”—Thomas JeffersonThe United States Constitution—the bedrock of our country, the foundation of our federal republic—is . . . dead. You won’t hear that from the politicians who endlessly pay lip service to the Constitution. It’s the dirty little secret that bestselling authors Thomas E. Woods Jr. and Kevin R. C. Gutzman expose in this provocative new book. The fact is that government officials—Democrats and Republicans, presidents, judges, and congresses alike—long ago rejected the idea that the Constitution possesses a fixed meaning limiting the U.S. government’s power. In case you’ve forgotten, this idea was not a minor aspect of the Constitution; it was the document’s very purpose. Woods and Gutzman round up the suspects responsible for the death of the government the Founding Fathers designed. Going right to the scenes of the crimes, they dissect twelve of the most egregious assaults on the Constitution—some virtually unknown. In chronicling this “dirty dozen,” the authors show that the attacks began long before presidents declared preemptive wars, congresses built pork-barrel bridges to nowhere, and Supreme Court justices began to behave as our supreme legislators. In Who Killed the Constitution? Woods and Gutzman• REVEAL the federal government’s “great gold robbery”—the flagrant assault on the Constitution you never heard about in history class• DESTROY the phony case for presidential war power• EXPOSE how the federal government has actively discriminated to end . . . discrimination• TEAR DOWN the “wall of separation” between church and state—an invention that completely contradicts what the Constitution says• DARE to touch the “third rail of American jurisprudence,” Brown v. Board of Education—showing why a government decision that seems “right” isn’t necessarily constitutionalNever shying away from controversy, Woods and Gutzman reveal an unsettling but unavoidable truth: now that the federal government has broken free of the Constitution’s chains, government officials are restrained by little more than their sense of what they can get away with.Who Killed the Constitution? is a rallying cry for Americans outraged by government run amok and a warning to take heed before we lose the liberties we are truly entitled to.",,,,July 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780307405753,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320410930l/2191970.jpg,4.14,[],140.0,2.0,,,,94.0,291.0,288,Crown Forum,"['127', '103', '44', '8', '9']",,['United States of America'],,"['Thomas E.

Wisdom of Our Fathers: Lessons and Letters from Daughters and Sons,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Inspirational', 'Memoir', 'Parenting', 'History', 'Family', 'Self Help', 'Biography Memoir', 'Short Stories']","What does it really mean to be a good father? What did your father tell you, that has stayed with you throughout your life? Was there a lesson from him, a story, or a moment that helped to make you who you are? Is there a special memory that makes you smile when you least expect it?After the publication of Tim Russert’s number one New York Times bestseller about his father, Big Russ & Me, he received an avalanche of letters from daughters and sons who wanted to tell him about their own fathers, most of whom were not superdads or heroes but ordinary men who were remembered and cherished for some of their best moments–of advice, tenderness, strength, honor, discipline, and occasional eccentricity.Most of these daughters and sons were eager to express the gratitude they had carried with them through the years. Others wanted to share lessons and memories and, most important, pass them down to their own children. This book is for all fathers, young or old, who can learn from the men in these pages how to get it right, and to understand that sometimes it is the little gestures that can make the big difference for your child. For some in this book, the appreciation came later than they would have liked. But as Wisdom of Our Fathers reminds us, it is never too late to embrace it. From the father who coached his daughter in sports (and life), attending every meet, game, performance, and tournament, to the daughter who, after a fifteen-year estrangement, learned to make peace with her difficult father just before he died, to the son who came, at last, to appreciate the silent way his father could show affection, Wisdom of Our Fathers shares rewarding lessons, immeasurable gifts, and lasting values.Heartfelt, humorous, engaging, irresistibly readable, and bound to bring back memories of unforgettable moments with our own fathers, Tim Russert’s new book is not only a fitting companion to his own marvelous memoir, but also a celebration of the positive qualities passed down from generation to generation.",,,01/01/06,May 15th 2007,[],Paperback,,9780812975437,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388303337l/367322.jpg,4.17,[],90.0,1.0,,,,97.0,1966.0,320,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['811', '753', '334', '58', '10']",,[],,['Tim Russert']

Who on Earth is Tom Baker?,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Doctor Who', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature']","One of the great British television phenomena of the 60's and 70's, known to all who are now entering or firmly placed in mid-life, was the advent of Doctor Who. This original and most British of television series chronicled the travels and tribulations of the famous Doctor Who and his merry band of followers. Tom Baker, though not the first but probably the most unforgettable of the actors who took on this role, has published an autobiography that not only lets us explore the man made famous but also the man himself. Tom inhabited the world of television production agencies, the BBC with its cast of thousands, and the drinking haunts of Soho with the likes of Jeffery Bernard, Anthony Hopkins and actors for whom feast and famine were a daily way of life.  Tom, with his expressive face and kind eyes was born in Liverpool to a raucous and lively Irish family where love and a good respect for the teachings of the Catholic Church were able to prepare him for an interesting and fulfilling life. In fact, Tom's early experiences with the church involved a trial at a monastery for an unsuccessful preparation as a priest and an insight into the daily workings of these institutions. A slow starting but rapidly improving acting career was followed by time spent pulling pints and on London construction sites before the big break. Then came with the casting agent and the meeting that allowed for instant world-wide recognition for the famous Doctor Who that still exists today.  The style of the story is very much that of a black comedy with a marriage, children and a certain fixation with a lawnmower and the mowing of the grass around his own gravestone, making for an enjoyable read. He is now happily married and living in a rural utopia outside of London, millions of miles and light years away from the hectic and all- consuming career of both straight acting and in the television role that has made him famous in more that 70 countries. --Brian Reinker",,,11/06/97,October 5th 1998,"['Laurence Olivier', 'Jeffrey Bernard', 'Tom Baker']",Paperback,,9780006388548,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180292188l/1020842.jpg,4.08,[],91.0,1.0,,,,94.0,700.0,262,HarperCollins,"['267', '273', '119', '33', '8']",,[],,['Tom Baker']

In Wellbeing: The Five Essential Elements, these bestselling authors team up to share the results of a landmark study of wellbeing and its implications for organizations and individuals. Their groundbreaking research reveals how organizations can help employees boost their overall wellbeing — from their satisfaction with their careers to their financial security and level of community involvement. After conducting this extensive study, Rath and Harter discovered that much of what we think will improve our wellbeing is either misguided or just plain wrong. When striving to improve our lives, we’re quick to buy into programs that promise to help us make money, lose weight or strengthen our relationships. While it might be easier to treat these critical areas in our lives as if they are independent, they’re not. Gallup’s comprehensive study of people in more than 150 countries revealed five universal, interconnected elements that shape our lives: Career Wellbeing, Social Wellbeing, Financial Wellbeing, Physical Wellbeing and Community Wellbeing. Wellbeing: The Five Essential Elements provides you with a holistic view of what contributes to your wellbeing over a lifetime. Written in a conversational style, this book is filled with fascinating research and innovative ideas for boosting your wellbeing in each of these five areas. As a complement to the book, you’ll have the opportunity to use Gallup’s online Wellbeing Finder to track and improve your wellbeing. By the time you finish reading this book, you’ll have a better understanding of what makes life worthwhile.

Wild Ducks Flying Backward,,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'American', 'Contemporary', 'Collections', 'Audiobook']","Known for his meaty seriocomic novels, Tom Robbins’s shorter work has appeared in publications ranging from Esquire to Harper’s, from Playboy to the New York Times. Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations—and even some untypical country-music lyrics—offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original. Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso’s Guernica, lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls “the genius waitress,” Tom Robbins’s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation.

But if Wilt can do nothing about his job, he can do something about his wife, in imagination at least, and his fantasies grow daily more murderous and more concrete.

Lewis Carroll first made us ponder this and, years later, Walt Disney again made viewers wonder who Maryann might be in his classic feature length film based on Carroll's book. Now, the amazingly talented folks at SLG Publishing, through a licensing deal with Disney, have finally answered this age-old question. In their beautifully executed comic book series, WONDERLAND, readers experience Alice's fantastic world as they've never seen it before. Writer Tommy Kovac's Wonderland is missing Alice herself, but it's still populated by the other characters that make the world such a curiously exciting place. The Queen of Hearts is present, barking orders to lop off people's heads, as is the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter and the rest of Wonderland's beloved cast.

After twenty-seven years of marriage and three children, Annie has fallen in love with Viveca, the wealthy, cultured, confident Manhattan art dealer who orchestrated her professional success.Annie and Viveca plan to wed in the Oh family's hometown of Three Rivers, Connecticut, where gay marriage has recently been legalized. But the impending wedding provokes some very mixed reactions and opens a Pandora's box of toxic secrets—dark and painful truths that have festered below the surface of the Ohs' lives.We Are Water is an intricate and layered portrait of marriage, family, and the inexorable need for understanding and connection, told in the alternating voices of the Ohs—nonconformist Annie; her ex-husband, Orion, a psychologist; Ariane, the do-gooder daughter, and her twin, Andrew, the rebellious only son; and free-spirited Marissa, the youngest Oh. Set in New England and New York during the first years of the Obama presidency, it is also a portrait of modern America, exploring issues of class, changing social mores, the legacy of racial violence, and the nature of creativity and art.With humor and breathtaking compassion, Wally Lamb brilliantly captures the essence of human experience in vivid and unforgettable characters struggling to find hope and redemption in the aftermath of trauma and loss. We Are Water is vintage Wally Lamb—a compulsively readable, generous, and uplifting masterpiece that digs deep into the complexities of the human heart to explore the ways in which we search for love and meaning in our lives.",,,,October 22nd 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780061941023,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361329815l/17349023.jpg,3.81,"['Lambda Literary Award Nominee for Lesbian General Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2013)']",194.0,2.0,,,,91.0,49001.0,561,Harper,"['12387', '20355', '11901', '3209', '1149']",,[],,['Wally Lamb']

The government’s ferocious response, and the refusal of the demonstrators to back down, sparked a brutal civil war that over the past five years has escalated into the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our times.Yet despite all the reporting, the video, and the wrenching photography, the stories of ordinary Syrians remain unheard, while the stories told about them have been distorted by broad brush dread and political expediency. This fierce and poignant collection changes that. Based on interviews with hundreds of displaced Syrians conducted over four years across the Middle East and Europe, We Crossed a Bridge and It Trembled is a breathtaking mosaic of first-hand testimonials from the frontlines. Some of the testimonies are several pages long, eloquent narratives that could stand alone as short stories; others are only a few sentences, poetic and aphoristic.

Since its first publication in 1646 it has remained absolutely unsurpassed as an accurate and concise statement of Christian doctrine. Among all the shifting sands of theological opinion here is solid truth, for it has its foundation in the unchanging truth of Scripture--witness the copious references from the Bible which are printed on each page. Because of its faithfulness to Scripture the Confession has permanent worth and abiding relevance.The Church of Christ cannot be creedless and live. Especially in an age of doubt and confusion, it is her duty to define the Christian faith and to proclaim it to the world. Nowhere has the Reformed Church done this so effectively as in The Westminster Confession of Faith. While always recognising the supreme place of the Word of God in all matters of faith and practice, one can always turn to the Confession as one's subordinate standard.

The lion is Sean, hero of this tremendous drama of the men who took possession of South Africa in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.Sean and his twin-brother Garrick grew up on their father's farm in Natal. The first part of the book deals with his childhood and youth and his longing to become a successful farmer and hard-hitting fighter like his father.The tough life of cattle-farming is brusquely interrupted by the Zulu Wars, when Sean and his brother see fighting for the first time. Wilbur Smith vividly recreates the excitement of the war for the young men-their hope of winning their own cattle, the horror of the massacre at Isandhlwana, the heroism of the defence at Rorkes Drift.'Witwatersrand' is the name of the second part of this book and it tells the story of Sean's fabulous success in the gold rush and his rich life with Duff Charleywood and the beautiful Candy in the new town of Johannesburg, where huge fortunes were made and lost in a morning's dealing on the Exchange.The atmosphere of this feverish, violent time is brilliantly drawn: the heavy drinking, the elaborate houses, the ruthless abandonment of the failure. Sean and Duff are caught at last in a trap laid by their rival, the sinister and clever Hradsky, and leave Johannesburg for the wilderness to seek their fortunes once more.And now the book moves to its climax. At last it seems as though Sean will settle to a quiet married life – but fate has other plans for him. They return to Johannesburg and tragedy strikes quickly. Sean finds himself alone once more...Filled with action scenes in war and the early heady days of the gold rush, and adventure among the vast game herds of the African wilderness, this novel is dominated by the towering compelling personality of Sean, whose life story is continued in The Sound of Thunder and A Sparrow Falls.Reviews * 'Plenty of incident and colour' – The Observer, 1966 * 'Pride of place goes to When the Lion Feeds because it is bigger, wider and more full of plot than all the others put together ...' – The Daily Telegraph, 1966. * 'Wilbur Smith has built up his wide-screen adventure story with energy and shrewdness.' – Sunday Times, 1966 * 'Mr. Smith is a natural story-teller who moves confidently and often splendidly in his period and sustains a flow of convincing incident without repeating his excitement.' – The Scotsman. 1966 * 'A very impressive book in its wide scope and its descriptive colour.' – Sphere",Courtney #1,,10/28/64,October 3rd 2006,['Sean Courtney'],Paperback,,9780312940669,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388892414l/16951.jpg,4.19,[],671.0,7.0,,,,97.0,13496.0,544,St. Martin's Paperbacks,"['5798', '5100', '2136', '351', '111']",,['South Africa'],,['Wilbur Smith']

White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India,,"['History', 'India', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Travel', 'Asia', '18th Century', 'Indian Literature', 'British Literature']","White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time. James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—'Most excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",,,March 29th 2002,April 27th 2004,[],Paperback,,9780142004128,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309285574l/124432.jpg,3.93,"['Wolfson History Prize (2003)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2004)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize Nominee (2003)']",26.0,1.0,,,,93.0,4091.0,580,Penguin Books,"['1239', '1676', '900', '210', '66']",,[],,['William Dalrymple']

Here is a tough-minded exploration of why we're in trouble, starting with the basic issues of who gets heard, who gets ignored, and why. Greider shows us the realities of power in Washington today, uncovering the hidden relationships that link politicians with corporations and the rich, and that subvert the needs of ordinary citizens.

"Writings, 1878-1899",,Fiction,"William James, a member of America's most illustrious intellectual family, is widely acclaimed as the country's foremost philosopher, the first of its psychologists, and a champion of religious pluralism. As the apostle of pragmatism, his influence on American thought is as strong now as it has ever been. James's emphasis on the creative power of faith, will, and action, his opening up of philosophy to the fresh air of ordinary experience, his fascination with alternative forms of belief and states of consciousness, and his impatience with dogmas of any kind--all make him a defender of individual experience, and earn him a place beside Emerson and Whitman as an exponent of American democratic culture. In this volume are the brilliant, engagingly written works of James's early and middle years. The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy advances the liberating argument that each of us has the right to believe in hypotheses that are not susceptible to proof and that such beliefs might actually change the world. The conversational style of these essays reflects their origin in public lectures, as well as James's conviction that truth can be discovered as much in the course of everyday life as in the activities of science or of philosophical speculation. Talks to Teachers and to Students, also drawn from lectures, helped transform the emerging science of education. Here James applies his new psychology to classroom theory and conduct, especially for the primary grades. This immensely influential book has never gone out of print. It emphasizes the role in learning of instinct, play, and habit, along with the importance of engaging the voluntary interests of students. James's warm and sympathetic nature informs his treatment of children, who can best be taught by those who respect the child's autonomy and who avoid what he calls ""hammering in."" Psychology: Briefer Course is far more than a shortened version of his monumental Principles of Psychology. It significantly revises parts of the earlier work and adds important new materials. (Students liked to call the longer book ""James"" and the shorter one ""Jimmy"".) James's new psychology moved away from discussions of the soul, morality, and logic, and focused instead on instinct, will, and the importance of action and habit. Passages comparing human consciousness to ""a wonderful stream"" inspired the ""stream of consciousness"" in the future work of Joyce, Woolf, and Gertrude Stein, a student of James's at Harvard. ""Human Immortality,"" which defends the possibility of life after death, and eight more of James's most important essays round out this second volume devoted to a writer who was called by John Dewey ""almost a Columbus of the inner world.""",,,,1992.0,,,0940450720,9780940450721,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rr6kPc52tI4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.22,,,,,,,,,1212.0,,,87.0,,,['William James']

It later became known all over Japan, and during the Second World War Jōchō’s precept ‘I found that the Way of the Samurai is death’, became a slogan to spur on Kamikaze pilots. But the Hagakure is not only about death. In this, his adaptation and interpretation of it, Yukio Mishima deals with its teachings on action, subjectivity, strength of character, passion and love, and delights in giving prolific examples of Jōchō’s practical advice from proper behavior at a drinking party to child rearing. In the Hagakure, the most important influence on his life – and his death – Mishima saw striking similarities between his criticisms of materialistic post-war Japan and Jōchō’s criticisms of the sumptuous decadence of his contemporaries; and it is this emphasis which gives it its immediacy.",,,10/30/67,August 4th 1977,['Yamamoto Tsunetomo'],Hardcover,,9780465090891,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311234224l/162374.jpg,3.89,[],96.0,1.0,,,,93.0,592.0,166,Basic Books,"['179', '217', '155', '36', '5']",,[],,"['Yukio Mishima', 'Kathryn Sparling', 'Yamamoto Tsunetomo']"

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”). Samad’s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal’s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith.
