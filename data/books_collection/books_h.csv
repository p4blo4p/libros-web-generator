Shame holds onto a past that haunts him. Damaged by the parents that should have taught him unconditional love; they imprisoned him with violence and disregard. Even now, Shame struggles to find both the independence and love he deserves. Knowing the blood that runs through him is stained merely by reputation, Hem seeks acceptance while he searches for ways to redeem himself in the eyes of those that have judged him his entire life.

Hotel World,,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Short Stories', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Queer', '21st Century']","Five disparate voices inhabit Ali Smith's dreamlike, mesmerising Hotel World, set in the luxurious anonymity of the Global Hotel, in an unnamed northern English city. The disembodied yet interconnected characters include Sara, a 19-year-old chambermaid who has recently died at the hotel; her bereaved sister, Clare, who visits the scene of Sara's death; Penny, an advertising copywriter who is staying in the room opposite; Lise, the Global's depressed receptionist; and the homeless Else who begs on the street outside. Smith's ambitious prose explores all facets of language and its uses. Sara takes us through the moment of her exit from the world and beyond; in her desperate, fading grip on words and senses she gropes to impart the meaning of her death in what she terms ""the lift for dishes""--then comes a flash of clarity: ""That's the name for it, the name for it; that's it; dumb waiter dumb waiter dumb waiter."" Blended with hers are other voices: Penny's bland journalese and Else's obsession with metaphysical poetry.  Hotel World is not an easy read: disturbing and witty by turns, with its stream-of-consciousness narrators reminiscent of Virgina Woolf's The Waves, its deceptively rambling language is underpinned by a formal construction. Exploring the ""big themes"" of love, death and millennial capitalism, it takes as its starting point Muriel Spark's Momento Mori (""Remember you must die"") and counteracts this axiom with a resolute ""Remember you must live"".

How to Be Both,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Art', 'Literary Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Novels', 'Queer', 'British Literature', 'Historical']","Passionate, compassionate, vitally inventive and scrupulously playful, Ali Smith’s novels are like nothing else. A true original, she is a one-of-a-kind literary sensation. Her novels consistently attract serious acclaim and discussion—and have won her a dedicated readership who are drawn again and again to the warmth, humanity and humor of her voice. How to be both is a novel all about art’s versatility. Borrowing from painting’s fresco technique to make an original literary double-take, it’s a fast-moving genre-bending conversation between forms, times, truths and fictions. There’s a Renaissance artist of the 1460s. There’s the child of a child of the 1960s. Two tales of love and injustice twist into a singular yarn where time gets timeless, structural gets playful, knowing gets mysterious, fictional gets real—and all life’s givens get given a second chance.A NOTE TO THE READER:Who says stories reach everybody in the same order?This novel can be read in two ways and this book provides you with both.In half of all printed editions of the novel the narrative EYES comes before CAMERA.In the other half of printed editions the narrative CAMERA precedes EYES.The narratives are exactly the same in both versions, just in a different order.

Yet returning to her hometown also brings her back to Hollis, March’s former soul mate and lover. March’s father had taken the teenaged Hollis, an abandoned child, and the product of a series of detention homes, into his house as a boarder, and treated him like a son. Yet March and Hollis’s passionate love was hardly a normal sibling relationship. When Hollis left her after a petty fight, March waited for him three long years, wondering what she had done wrong.Encountering Hollis again makes March acutely aware of the choices that she has made, and the choices everyone around her has made—including Mrs. Dale, who knew more of love than March could ever have suspected, and her brother Alan, whose tragic history has left him grief-struck, with alcohol as his only solace. Her attraction to Hollis is overwhelming—and March jeopardizes her marriage, her relationship with her daughter and her own happiness in an attempt to reclaim the past.",,,10/28/97,July 1st 1999,"['Hank Cooper', 'March Murray', 'Hollis']",Paperback,,9780425169698,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388299278l/5159._SY475_.jpg,3.69,[],290.0,3.0,,,,90.0,45446.0,336,Berkley,"['10019', '16846', '14122', '3472', '987']",,['Jenkintown (United States)'],,['Alice Hoffman']

Heavy Sand,,"['Fiction', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'War', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Jewish']","Two main parts of Anatoly Rybakov are titled after the writer’s major novels, Children of the Arbat and Heavy Sand, and explore the continuing relevance of these works for contemporary Russia. In contrast to Germany and its former allies, which went through an effective de-Nazification campaign, the Soviet Union experienced two aborted attempts to re-evaluate its totalitarian past and to dismantle Stalinist ideology and institutions: the Thaw and perestroika. However, as the filmmaker claims, in the Soviet Union the efforts of de-Stalinization and broader de-Sovietization were only half-hearted and never completed. The myth of the great Stalinist Empire and the heroic myth of the Great Patriotic War still obscure from Russians’ communal memory the uncomfortable narratives about Stalinist purges, the Holocaust, and Soviet-era anti-Semitism. Goldovskaia’s film cuts from footage of Stalin-era parades to present-day rallies in Moscow by fascists and nationalists, suggesting that the unfinished de-Sovietization breeds a new type of totalitarian mentality.The section about Rybakov’s Heavy Sand explores Soviet-style Holocaust denial. The communal myth of Soviet martyrdom and victory in World War II is used to replace memories of the Holocaust. Goldovskaia links this Soviet experience of purposeful and state-endorsed manipulation of the historical past with the revival of anti-Semitism in present-day Russia. Anatoly Rybakov is, indeed, “the Russian story,” since it explains graphically how Russia’s way of dealing with its totalitarian past is different from the Western treatment of a similar social disease. The filmmaker’s message is clearly articulated by her observational cinema style: the agenda of de-Sovietization, including the acknowledgment of the Holocaust, has to become part of Russians’ collective memory before the country can exorcise its totalitarian demons.",,,10/30/78,September 30th 1982,[],Paperback,,9780140055351,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423751566l/694321.jpg,4.44,[],151.0,2.0,,,,98.0,436.0,384,Penguin Books,"['261', '120', '46', '6', '3']",,[],,"['Anatoli Rybakov', 'Harold Shukman']"

But as her mental health steadily declined, and with no one else left to care for him, authorities arrived and tore Andrew from his screaming mother's arms. In that moment, the life he knew came crashing down around him. He was only seven years old.

Naked on a bed in an unfamiliar, empty room, she is unable to move her limbs. Worse, she cannot remember who she is. Panic-stricken, Hillary desperately searches her mind for answers, but finds nothing more than fear and confusion.A man enters the room—a stranger to Hillary. He introduces himself as Dr. Morrison. Seemingly benign, he informs Hillary that she is there for her own good…that she is under his care until she regains her memory. Hillary cannot remember anything, but her instincts warn her not to trust this man who claims to be her doctor. She can only hope that someone will come looking for her…that someone will find her before it is too late. Several weeks later, Hillary’s situation has grown even more dismal.

How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'Philosophy', 'Comedy', 'Audiobook', 'Political Science', 'Reference', 'History', 'Cultural']","Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover editionISBN 10: 1400054184ISBN13: 9781400054183See: Original Cover HereWelcome to the world of Ann Coulter. With her monumental bestsellers Treason, Slander, and High Crimes and Misdemeanors, Coulter has become the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual in years—and certainly the most controversial. Now, in How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), which is sure to ignite impassioned debate, she offers her most comprehensive analysis of the American political scene to date. With incisive reasoning, refreshing candor, and razor-sharp wit, she reveals just why liberals have got it so wrong.In this powerful and entertaining book, which draws on her weekly columns, Coulter ranges far and wide. No subject is off-limits, and no comment is left unsaid. After all, she writes, “Nothing too extreme can be said about liberals because it’s all true.” How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must) offers Coulter’s unvarnished take on: •The essence of being a liberal: “The absolute conviction that there is one set of rules for you, and another, completely different set of rules for everyone else.”•John Kerry: “A reporter asked Kerry, ‘Are you for or against gay marriage?’ As usual, his answer was, ‘Yes.’ ”•Her 9/11 comments: “I am often asked if I still think we should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity. The answer is: Now more than ever!”•The state of the Democratic Party: “Teddy Kennedy crawls out of Boston Harbor with a quart of Scotch in one pocket and a pair of pantyhose in the other, and Democrats hail him as their party’s spiritual leader.” •Her philosophy for arguing with liberals: “Tough love, except I don’t love them. My ‘tough love’ approach is much like the Democrats’ ‘middle-class tax cuts’—everything but the last word.”•The “Treason Lobby”: “Want to make liberals angry? Defend the United States.”In this full-on Coulterpalooza, you’ll find the real, uncensored Ann Coulter. A special concluding chapter even includes the pieces that squeamish editors refused to publish—“what you could have read if you lived in a free country,” says Coulter. How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must) is a stunning reminder of why Ann Coulter’s commentary has achieved must-read status.Note: All information herein, such as number of pages, publisher, etc., refer to this alternate cover edition and may or may not coincide with the main entry for this ISBN or any other alternate covers.~",,,01/01/04,October 5th 2004,"['Bill Clinton', 'Ann Coulter', 'Liberals']",Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1425510947l/266380.jpg,3.31,[],316.0,5.0,,,,73.0,2771.0,353,Crown Forum,"['673', '751', '612', '235', '500']",,[],,['Ann Coulter']

The authors--Anne Berest, Audrey Diwan, Caroline de Maigret, and Sophie Mas--unmarried but attached, with children--have been friends for years. Talented bohemian iconoclasts with careers in the worlds of music, film, fashion and publishing, they are untypically frank and outspoken as they debunk the myths about what it means to be a French woman today.

They admit to being snobs, a bit self-centered, unpredictable but not unreliable. Bossy and opinionated, they are also tender and romantic.You will be taken on a first date, to a party, to some favorite haunts in Paris, to the countryside, and to one of their dinners at home with recipes even you could do -- but to be out with them is to be in for some mischief and surprises. They will tell you how to be mysterious and sensual, look natural, make your boyfriend jealous, and how they feel about children, weddings and going to the gym. And they will share their address book in Paris for where to go: At the End of the Night, for A Birthday, for a Smart Date, for a A Hangover, for Vintage Finds and much more.

The fountainhead of that stream was William Tyndale's New Testament of 1526; marking its course King James Version of 1611 (KJV), the English Revised Version of 1885 (RV), the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV), and the Revised Standard Version of 1952 and 1971 (RSV). In that stream, faithfulness to the text and vigorous pursuit of accuracy were combined with simplicity, beauty, and dignity of expression. Our goal has been to carry forward this legacy for a new century.During the Reformation, a renewed interest in Scripture brought great light to the church and the world. In The Reformation Study Bible, general editor R. C. Sproul aims to present the light of the Reformation anew by combining an accessible translation with study notes that stand firmly in the theological tradition of the Reformation.No other study Bible gives the reader more assistance in understanding the great doctrines and themes of the Christian faith as found in the Scriptures. Extensive notes have been researched and written by a team of more than fifty scholars, including J. I. Packer, James Boice, and Wayne Grudem.All Christians that want to dig deeper in their study of Scripture will appreciate the Bible’s many features, including section introductions, book introductions and outlines, comments on the biblical text, theological notes, charts, in-text maps, and cross-references.The first study bible based on the English Standard Version, The Reformation Study Bible is the perfect choice for men and women that want to study God’s word in a language they can understand.",,,,February 16th 2005,[],Hardcover,,9780875526430,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170434976l/53948._SX318_.jpg,4.68,[],197.0,2.0,,,,98.0,1564.0,1948,P & R Publishing,"['1229', '222', '80', '14', '19']",,[],,

How and Why God Evolved: An Alternative Perspective,,[],"""Focusing on some of the more unusual verses from the Bible, the Qur’an, and Gita, author Babar Shah Khan highlights certain facts about holy book verses and clarifies some misguided interpretations about these verses, and he shares his ideas on God’s evolution by comparing these spiritual texts.  How and Why God Evolved highlights the link among pagan, polytheistic, and monotheistic beliefs. Khan points out misrepresentations of Holy Scriptures and discusses some of the political reasons involved. He brings to the forefront the importance of understanding how the notion of God evolved throughout history, in keeping with the human brain’s development. He also shows how God and humans have fashioned each other in an attempt to understand and reach one another.  Khan exposes the textual commonalities among Holy Books and shows how modern-day religions spring from previous religions. How and Why God Evolved discusses why no one religion is truly unique or separate from others. They are all connected deeply by similar rites, rituals, and reasons; all religions share more commonalities than differences.""

In Holy Envy, she contemplates the myriad ways other people and traditions encounter the Transcendent, both by digging deeper into those traditions herself and by seeing them through her students’ eyes as she sets off with them on field trips to monasteries, temples, and mosques. Troubled and inspired by what she learns, Taylor returns to her own tradition for guidance, finding new meaning in old teachings that have too often been used to exclude religious strangers instead of embracing the divine challenges they present. Re-imagining some central stories from the religion she knows best, she takes heart in how often God chooses outsiders to teach insiders how out-of-bounds God really is.Throughout Holy Envy, Taylor weaves together stories from the classroom with reflections on how her own spiritual journey has been complicated and renewed by connecting with people of other traditions—even those whose truths are quite different from hers.  The one constant in her odyssey is the sense that God is the one calling her to disown her version of God—a change that ultimately enriches her faith in other human beings and in God. ",,,March 2019,March 12th 2019,[],ebook,,9780062406583,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1533926080l/35068512.jpg,4.4,[],44.0,1.0,,,,98.0,2575.0,256,HarperOne,"['1357', '940', '232', '33', '13']",,[],,['Barbara Brown Taylor']

The last thing Daddy needs to know is why—she yearns for a lover who’s man enough for a relationship but animal enough to give her the wild ride of her dreams. After a treadmill mishap lands her in a tangled heap with Jason Cannon, she wonders if she’s finally found her beast, er, man. One session in bed and one bite later, she’s sure. Now if only she can keep her father from mounting Jason’s head on a wall…Jason is all man on the surface, but wolf shifter down to the bone. He’s more than ready to stop “playing the pack” and find his one true mate, and Sydney of the luscious curves is the woman of his dreams. Finding out that she comes from a family sworn to eradicate his kind isn’t a deal-breaker. But her outrageous plan for him to masquerade as the wolf in hunter’s clothing, right under her father’s very nose, could be asking more than he ever expected to give.Warning: Readers, be aware of stranger side effects.

Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up,,"['Art', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Pop Culture', 'Art History', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']","From Library JournalThe former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Colacello has an insider's story to tell. This book is as bitchy and packed with names as its readers could want. The Andy Warhol Factory is described (not surprisingly) as an exploitative place where Andy got richer and richer while his drones worked harder and harder. Colacello's straightforward chronology of working and partying in Warhol's circle is tinged by his bitterness over a heavy workload and little pay at the Factory. His tone captures perfectly the self-obsessed philosophy that drove Warhol, his hangers-on, and the subculture of sex, drugs, parties, discos, and the New York art scene of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Henry Miller: The Paris Years,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'France', '20th Century']","Miller didn't just inhabit Paris, he devoured it. Not the Paris of the guidebooks, but the City of Light's lurid backways and backwaters, the dens of vice where he could slough off the pale cast of American puritanism and embrace the hedonistic facts of life. The Parisian life of Miller was a turbulent quest for new sensations and avenues, a roisterous, slumming exploration of the soul. This world Miller shared with Brassai, one of the greatest photographers of our century. Miller and Brassai's friendship was a recognition of kindred spirits, born of mutual admiration for each other's tireless, restless fascination with Paris and its inhabitants. In Miller, Brassai found his most compelling subject. Using unpublished letters, recollected conversations, and references to Miller's workand featuring sixteen unforgettable examples of Brassai's photography""Henry Miller: The Paris Years"" is an intimate account of a writer's self-discovery, seen through the unblinking eye of a master photographer. Brassai delves into Miller's relationships with Anais Nin and Lawrence Durrell, as well as his hopelessly tangled though wildly inspiring marriage to June. Brassai remembers Miller's favorite cafes and haunts, revives Miller's idols and anathemas, and evokes their shared passion for the street life of a Montparnasse and Montmartre captured, even during those depression years, in a dazzling moment of illumination.",,,11/05/75,August 1st 2007,[],Paperback,,9781559703475,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348005316l/84036.jpg,4.14,[],94.0,1.0,,,,97.0,344.0,240,Arcade Publishing,"['133', '137', '65', '8', '1']",,[],,"['Brassaï', 'Timothy Bent']"

Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Sports', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Canada', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'History']","In his own words, Bret Hart’s honest, perceptive, startling account of his life in and out of the pro wrestling ring.The sixth-born son of the pro wrestling dynasty founded by Stu Hart and his elegant wife, Helen, Bret Hart is a Canadian icon. As a teenager, he could have been an amateur wrestling Olympic contender, but instead he turned to the family business, climbing into the ring for his dad’s western circuit, Stampede Wrestling. From his early twenties until he retired at 43, Hart kept an audio diary, recording stories of the wrestling life, the relentless travel, the practical jokes, the sex and drugs, and the real rivalries (as opposed to the staged ones). The result is an intimate, no-holds-barred account that will keep readers, not just wrestling fans, riveted.Hart achieved superstardom in pink tights, and won multiple wrestling belts in multiple territories, for both the WWF (now the WWE) and WCW. But he also paid the price in betrayals (most famously by Vince McMahon, a man he had served loyally); in tragic deaths, including the loss of his brother Owen, who died when a stunt went terribly wrong; and in his own massive stroke, most likely resulting from a concussion he received in the ring, and from which, with the spirit of a true champion, he has battled back.Widely considered by his peers as one of the business’s best technicians and workers, Hart describes pro wrestling as part dancing, part acting, and part dangerous physical pursuit. He is proud that in all his years in the ring he never seriously hurt a single wrestler, yet did his utmost to deliver to his fans an experience as credible as it was exciting. He also records the incredible toll the business takes on its workhorses: he estimates that twenty or more of the wrestlers he was regularly matched with have died young, weakened by their own coping mechanisms, namely drugs, alcohol, and steroids. That toll included his own brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith. No one has ever written about wrestling like Bret Hart. No one has ever lived a life like Bret Hart’s.For as long as I can remember, my world was filled with liars and bullshitters, losers and pretenders, but I also saw the good side of pro wrestling. To me there is something bordering on beautiful about a brotherhood of big tough men who pretended to hurt one another for a living instead of actually doing it.

Deep beneath its surface lies the remnants of an obliterated alien civilization and the buried memories of its unrecorded past that, when unearthed, could tear the galaxy apart.",Hellhole Trilogy #1,,,March 15th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780765322692,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435768340l/8734164._SY475_.jpg,3.69,[],95.0,1.0,,,,88.0,2102.0,517,Tor Books,"['488', '808', '560', '156', '90']",,[],,"['Brian Herbert', 'Kevin J.

Hunters of Dune,,Fiction,"Hunters of Dune and the concluding volume, Sandworms of Dune, bring together the great story lines and beloved characters in Frank Herbert's classic Dune universe, ranging from the time of the Butlerian Jihad to the original Dune series and beyond. Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades. At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune--Frank Herbert's final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark counterparts to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. The nearly invincible Honored Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to revive key figures from Dune's past--including Paul Muad'Dib and his beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington Yueh. Each of these characters will use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them. Failure is unthinkable--not only is their survival at stake, but they hold the fate of the entire human race in their hands.",,,,2006.0,,,0765312921,9780765312921,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gGlnvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.65,,,,,,,,,524.0,,,10459.0,,,"['Brian Herbert', 'Kevin J.

It’s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God’s call to recognize that we’re really nothing without Him. It’s pride versus humility. And it’s a fight we can’t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God’s abundant favor. “This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.” —Isaiah 66:2, ESV God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble.

A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses.

But it has not always been easy to see how to apply these insights in the real world – until now.   In How to Have a Good Day, Webb explains exactly how to apply this science to our daily tasks and routines. She translates three big scientific ideas into step-by-step guidance that shows us how to set better priorities, make our time go further, ace every interaction, be our smartest selves, strengthen our personal impact, be resilient to setbacks, and boost our energy and enjoyment. Through it all, Webb teaches us how to navigate the typical challenges of modern workplaces—from conflict with colleagues to dull meetings and overflowing inboxes—with skill and ease.  Filled with stories of people who have used Webb’s insights to boost their job satisfaction and performance at work, How to Have a Good Day is the book so many people wanted when they finished Nudge, Blink and Thinking Fast and Slow and were looking for practical ways to apply this fascinating science to their own lives and careers.    A remarkable and much-needed book, How to Have a Good Day gives us the tools we need to have a lifetime of good days.From the Hardcover edition.",,,,February 2nd 2016,[],Kindle Edition,,B00X2F7RPG,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491959924l/28370086._SY475_.jpg,4.02,[],99.0,1.0,,,,93.0,2119.0,370,Crown Business,"['790', '768', '412', '121', '28']",,[],,['Caroline Webb']

The book culminates in ""The Forbidden Poems""--a retelling of the stories of the Old and New Testaments, a reshaping of religion and history in the present.

Hard Times,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Victorian', 'British Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Classic Literature']","""My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,"" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a ""fanatic of the demonstrable fact,"" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: ""He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.""",,,10/28/54,October 9th 2003,"['Thomas Gradgrind', ""Mr. M'Choakumchild"", 'Stephen Blackpool', 'Josiah Bounderby', 'Sissy Jupe']",Paperback,,9780321107213,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348651243l/5344.jpg,3.54,[],3103.0,43.0,,,,85.0,56829.0,353,Pearson Longman,"['11022', '19008', '18460', '6062', '2277']",,['Coketown (United Kingdom)'],,['Charles Dickens']

Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain,,"['Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Rock N Roll', 'Pop Culture', 'Autobiography', 'The United States Of America']","The art of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was all about his private life, but written in a code as obscure as T.S. Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography Heavier Than Heaven, an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets, thanks to 400-plus interviews, and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created, how lies helped him die, how his family and love life entwined his art--plus, what the heck ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl, Cobain, and the ""over-bored and self-assured"" Tobi Vail, who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia, Washington, ""outcast teen"" underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like ""Aneurysm"" and ""Drain You."")  Cross uncovers plenty of news, mostly grim and gripping. As a teen, Cobain said he had ""suicide genes,"" and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family, then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet, popular teen athlete and sinister berserker, a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat, a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one), a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest, best friends. In fact, his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross, the coauthor of Nevermind: Nirvana, the definitive book about the making of the classic album, puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on Nevermind was a tidal slough, so nobody could sleep under it.)

    Damaged Portland detective Archie Sheridan spent ten years tracking Gretchen Lowell, a beautiful serial killer, but in the end she was the one who caught him. Two years ago, Gretchen kidnapped Archie and tortured him for ten days, but instead of killing him, she mysteriously decided to let him go. She turned herself in, and now Gretchen has been locked away for the rest of her life, while Archie is in a prison of another kind---addicted to pain pills, unable to return to his old life, powerless to get those ten horrific days off his mind. Archie's a different person, his estranged wife says, and he knows she's right. He continues to visit Gretchen in prison once a week, saying that only he can get her to confess as to the whereabouts of more of her victims, but even he knows the truth---he can't stay away.
    When another killer begins snatching teenage girls off the streets of Portland, Archie has to pull himself together enough to lead the new task force investigating the murders. A hungry young newspaper reporter, Susan Ward, begins profiling Archie and the investigation, which sparks a deadly game between Archie, Susan, the new killer, and even Gretchen. They need to catch a killer, and maybe somehow then Archie can free himself from Gretchen, once and for all. Either way, Heartsick makes for one of the most extraordinary suspense debuts in recent memory.

With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor’s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna’s twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race—and the ways in which love can complicate them all.

These days there are many people whom we need to question: politicians, lawyers, doctors, teachers, clergy members, bankers, car salesmen, and your boss. This book will empower you with the ability to spot faulty reasoning and, by asking the right sorts of questions, hold people accountable not only for what they believe but how they behave. By using this book you’ll learn to analyze your own thoughts, ideas, and beliefs, and why you act on them (or don’t). This, in turn, will help you to understand why others might hold opposing views. And the best way to change our own or others’ behavior or attitudes is to gain greater clarity about underlying motives and thought processes.

As activist and writer Cristina Page shows, the gains made by birth-control advocates (historically) and pro-choice organizations (currently) have formed the bedrock of freedoms few Americans would choose to live without. Now, not only is the future of legal abortion far from guaranteed, in many parts of the country ready access to many forms of contraception is in jeopardy as well. And that development, Page argues, should have everyone, regardless of moral or political persuasion, deeply concerned. For these basic freedoms are not just for the freewheeling gals of ""Sex and the City,"" but are central to the lives of working mothers and fathers from Phoenix to Duluth, churchgoers and nonbelievers alike. Page crystallizes the thoughts and attitudes of a generation of women and men whose voices are seldom heard in the political arena. How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America is the first book to address the positive transformation our society has undergone because of our ability to plan when and if to have children. It also exposes the anti-choice movement's far-reaching-and dangerous-agenda.

His response is an exploration of German society and its ingrained anti-semitism that demands a fundamental revision of our thinking about the years 1933-1945.

Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'World War II', 'Germany', 'War', 'European History', 'Politics', 'Military History', 'Historical']","This groundbreaking international bestseller lays to rest many myths about the Holocaust: that Germans were ignorant of the mass destruction of Jews, that the killers were all SS men, and that those who slaughtered Jews did so reluctantly. Hitler's Willing Executioners provides conclusive evidence that the extermination of European Jewry engaged the energies and enthusiasm of tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. Goldhagen reconstructs the climate of ""eliminationist anti-Semitism"" that made Hitler's pursuit of his genocidal goals possible and the radical persecution of the Jews during the 1930s popular. Drawing on a wealth of unused archival material, principally the testimony of the killers themselves, Goldhagen takes us into the killing fields where Germans voluntarily hunted Jews like animals, tortured them wantonly, and then posed cheerfully for snapshots with their victims. From mobile killing units to the camps to the death marches, Goldhagen shows how ordinary Germans, nurtured in a society where Jews were seen as unalterable evil and dangerous, willingly followed their beliefs to their logical conclusion.""Hitler's Willing Executioners is an original, indeed brilliant contribution to the...literature on the Holocaust.""--New York Review of Books""The most important book ever published about the Holocaust...Eloquently written, meticulously documented, impassioned...A model of moral and scholarly integrity.""--Philadelphia Inquirer",,,10/30/96,January 28th 1997,[],Paperback,,9780679772682,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430013923l/784848.jpg,3.68,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (1996)'],131.0,2.0,,,,85.0,4350.0,634,Vintage,"['1233', '1451', '1020', '352', '294']",,[],,['Daniel Jonah Goldhagen']

Now, in House of Spies, Gabriel Allon is back and out for revenge – determined to hunt down the world’s most dangerous terrorist, a shadowy ISIS mastermind known only as Saladin. Four months after the deadliest attack on the American homeland since 9/11, terrorists leave a trail of carnage through London’s glittering West End. The attack is a brilliant feat of planning and secrecy, but with one loose thread. The thread leads Gabriel Allon and his team of operatives to the south of France and to the gilded doorstep of Jean-Luc Martel and Olivia Watson. A beautiful former British fashion model, Olivia pretends not to know that the true source of Martel’s enormous wealth is drugs. And Martel, likewise, turns a blind eye to the fact he is doing business with a man whose objective is the very destruction of the West. Together, under Gabriel’s skilled hand, they will become an unlikely pair of heroes in the global war on terrorism.Written in seductive and elegant prose, the story moves swiftly from the glamour of Saint-Tropez to the grit of Casablanca and, finally, to an electrifying climax that will leave readers breathless long after they turn the final page.",Gabriel Allon #17,,,July 11th 2017,[],ebook,,9780062354365,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493739728l/31371230.jpg,4.3,[],1907.0,20.0,,,,97.0,28958.0,576,Harper,"['13848', '11331', '2842', '584', '353']",,[],,['Daniel Silva']

How Old Is the Universe?,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Astronomy', 'Nature']","Astronomers have determined that our universe is 13.7 billion years old. How exactly did they come to this precise conclusion? How Old Is the Universe? tells the incredible story of how astronomers solved one of the most compelling mysteries in science and, along the way, introduces readers to fundamental concepts and cutting-edge advances in modern astronomy. The age of our universe poses a deceptively simple question, and its answer carries profound implications for science, religion, and philosophy. David Weintraub traces the centuries-old quest by astronomers to fathom the secrets of the nighttime sky. Describing the achievements of the visionaries whose discoveries collectively unveiled a fundamental mystery, he shows how many independent lines of inquiry and much painstakingly gathered evidence, when fitted together like pieces in a cosmic puzzle, led to the long-sought answer. Astronomers don't believe the universe is 13.7 billion years old--they know it. You will too after reading this book. By focusing on one of the most crucial questions about the universe and challenging readers to understand the answer, Weintraub familiarizes readers with the ideas and phenomena at the heart of modern astronomy, including red giants and white dwarfs, cepheid variable stars and supernovae, clusters of galaxies, gravitational lensing, dark matter, dark energy and the accelerating universe--and much more. Offering a unique historical approach to astronomy, How Old Is the Universe? sheds light on the inner workings of scientific inquiry and reveals how astronomers grapple with deep questions about the physical nature of our universe.",,,01/01/10,December 5th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780691147314,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340740142l/9867149.jpg,4.19,[],97.0,1.0,,,,95.0,62.0,370,Princeton University Press,"['28', '22', '9', '2', '1']",,[],,['David A.

Hank Brodt Holocaust Memoirs - A Candle and a Promise,,[],"Hank Brodt Holocaust Memoirs - A Candle and a PromiseThe troubling but ultimately triumphant memoirs of Holocaust survivor Hank BrodtA story of resilience, A Candle and a Promise makes the Holocaust memories of survivor Hank Brodt come alive. It offers a detailed historical account of being a Jewish teenager under the Nazi regime, shedding light on sickening truths in an honest, matter-of-fact way.Hank Brodt (b. 1925) lived through one of the darkest periods of human history and survived the devastation of World War II. Born into a poor family in Boryslaw (Poland), he was placed in a Jewish orphanage. Losing his whole family when the Germans invaded Poland, he waged a daily battle to survive. Moving from forced labor camps to concentration camps, one of which features in Schindler’s List, his world behind the barbed wire consisted of quiet resistance, invisible tears and silent cries for years on end.This story of survival includes rare photographs from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum that powerfully illustrate these intimate and shocking memoirs. One recently discovered picture shows Hank Brodt in prison uniform removing the dead on carts at the liberated Ebensee concentration camp on May 7, 1945.It is hard to believe that someone who endured such horrific events could go on to live a life of gratitude. Through his unwavering compassion towards others, Hank Brodt managed to keep his humanity and find a way to move forward.After the Second World War, Hank Brodt testified at the trial of Nazi war criminal Amon Goeth in Dachau, Germany. He has joined the March of the Living since 2006, walking from Auschwitz to Birkenau on Yom Hashoah to pay tribute to the millions that died.

Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of US Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan,,"['Military Fiction', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Biography', 'Military History', 'Audiobook', 'Horses', 'Historical', 'Media Tie In']","The inspiration for the major motion picture 12 Strong from Jerry Bruckheimer, starring Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon.From the New York Times bestselling author of In Harm’s Way comes a true-life story of American soldiers overcoming great odds to achieve a stunning military victory.Horse Soldiers is the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy army across the mountainous Afghanistan terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential to defeat their opponent throughout the country.The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators as they rode into the city, and the streets thronged with Afghans overjoyed that the Taliban regime had been overthrown.Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed by the would-be POWs. Dangerously overpowered, they fought for their lives in the city’s immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the entire effort to outmaneuver the Taliban was likely doomed.Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton’s account of the Americans’ quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The soldiers on horses combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople proved a valuable lesson for America’s ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.",,,,May 5th 2009,"['General Doustoum', 'Mike Spann', 'Mitch Nelson', 'Mark Mitchell', 'Cal Spencer', 'Sam Diller', 'Atta Mohammed Noor', 'Lt.

The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.",,,10/12/57,10/04/04,"['Max Cannon', 'Cindy Lou Who', 'Grinch']",Hardcover,,9780007173044,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958149l/113946.jpg,4.36,[],98302.0,1267.0,,,,95.0,330214.0,64,Harper Collins Children's Books,"['196470', '77848', '40129', '10035', '5732']",,"['Who-ville, Mount Crumpit']",,['Dr. Seuss']

Harold Larwood,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Sports']","Harold Larwood is an England cricketing legend. During the MCC's notorious 1932–3 Ashes tour of Australia, his ""Bodyline"" bowling left Australia's batsmen bruised and battered, halved the batting average of the great Don Bradman—and gave England a 4–1 series victory. But the diplomatic row that followed brought Anglo-Australian relations to the brink of collapse. Larwood was used as a scapegoat by the MCC, which demanded he apologize for bowling Bodyline. Arguing that he had simply obeyed the instructions of his captain, Douglas Jardine, Larwood refused. He never played for England again. The Bodyline saga has been told before, but Larwood’s story has not. Using materials provided by the fast bowler’s family, Duncan Hamilton has created an intimate and compelling portrait of Larwood's life: from his mining village upbringing, through the trauma of 1932–3 and its bitter aftermath, to his emigration to Australia, where he and his family found happiness.

Now, with Homer & Langley, this master novelist has once again created an unforgettable work.Homer and Langley Collyer are brothers – the one blind and deeply intuitive, the other damaged into madness, or perhaps greatness, by mustard gas in the Great War. They live as recluses in their once grand Fifth Avenue mansion, scavenging the city streets for things they think they can use, hoarding the daily newspapers as research for Langley’s proposed dateless newspaper whose reportage will be as prophecy. Yet the epic events of the century play out in the lives of the two brothers – wars, political movements, technological advances – and even though they want nothing more than to shut out the world, history seems to pass through their cluttered house in the persons of immigrants, prostitutes, society women, government agents, gangsters, jazz musicians... and their housebound lives are fraught with odyssean peril as they struggle to survive and create meaning for themselves.

Before that, my life had been perfect and then I was stripped away from my family. And while it certainly wasn’t what you’d call the typical family, it had been my family, my life. I had everything: loving parents, a huge biker family (even though they did fight like cat and dogs a lot), and the love from every member of one of the most notorious clubs in United States history. The Reapers blood flew through every vein in my body.  It took my years to find out why—or better who—had stripped me of my life, never knowing who the man was that’d taken everything from me. But he certainly knew who I was and, more importantly, he knew my parents. He took me hostage just to get back at my parents for something that had happened years ago.  I was the price my parents paid. Worst of all, I’ve been stuck here for years. Nothing about my stay with the Demons of Hell motorcycle club is glorious, especially not with the things they say and worst of all, the things they force me to do. I started out as a girl full of light but having spent so much time in the dark has sucked almost every bit of light I had left.  Darkness was all I’d known until I met him, and he lit the last remaining ember I’d had left inside me.  Damon  When I agreed to go undercover at the Demons of Hell motorcycle club, I had no idea exactly what my father had been signing me up for.  My father’s personal gain had been my sole purpose. Growing up in the Brotherhood Motorcycle Club had given me a good idea of the club life but being thrown into Rage’s idea of a club was something that nobody could’ve prepared me for.  Four years in this club and I’d learned next to nothing. Every day, I could feel myself getting closer to the information my father sent me for, that my family needed. My father had abandoned everything, and it had all been Rage’s fault. Even so, my father had vowed to return, to right every and all wrongdoing that Rage had had a hand in and he would fulfill that promise.  And while I may have come here for my father’s bidding, that wasn’t the reason I’d decided to stay. I could’ve made the choice a long time ago to run back home, to return even if it was with nothing useful. Every single day that I’m here, I stare in the face of the person I’ve decided to stay for. Her face screams how lost and broken she is, how she’s had everything ripped from her by him. Rage calls her his property and I’m letting him think that for now.

Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood. We catch glimpses of bombing raids, street crimes, a cattle car from which human cries emerge, an Italian soldier succumbing to frostbite on the Russian front, the dumb endurance of peasants who have lived their whole lives with nothing and now must get by with less than nothing.",La Storia #1-2,,10/30/74,February 8th 2000,['Ida Mancuso'],Paperback,,9781586420048,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388594061l/1158380.jpg,4.24,['National Book Award Finalist for Translation (1978)'],166.0,2.0,,,,94.0,4227.0,754,Steerforth,"['2186', '1190', '609', '184', '58']",,['Italy'],,"['Elsa Morante', 'Lily Tuck']"

Escaping gray London in 1972, a beautiful, determined mother takes her daughters, aged 5 and 7, to Morocco in search of adventure, a better life, and maybe love. Hideous Kinky follows two little English girls -- the five-year-old narrator and Bea, her seven-year-old sister -- as they struggle to establish some semblance of normal life on a trip to Morocco with their hippie mother, Julia. Once in Marrakech, Julia immerses herself in Sufism and her quest for personal fulfillment, while her daughters rebel -- the older by trying to recreate her English life, the younger by turning her hopes for a father on a most unlikely candidate. Shocking and wonderful, Hideous Kinky is at once melancholy and hopeful. A remarkable debut novel from one of England's finest young writers, Hideous Kinky was inspired by the author's own experiences as a child.

But while escaping through the Pool of Tears (the portal connecting Wonderland to our world), crushing centrifugal force pulled them apart, and Alyss was lost. In this geographic parallel adventure, Hatter finds himself in Paris, France in the year 1859 shockingly separated from the child he had been sworn to protect.Unbeknownst to Hatter, Alyss had exited a puddle in London, England. Lost and alone, she was befriended by an aspiring author to whom she told the surreal, violent, heartbreaking story of her young life only to see it published as the nonsensical children's fairytale Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. But Carrol had got it all wrong.He even misspelled her name! Alyss had trusted Lewis Carrol to tell the truth so that Hatter would find her and bring her home. Instead, Hatter must endure a non-stop quest, crisscrossing the globe for 13 years in search of the lost Princess. While formidable with blades, a moment must be taken to introduce his signature weapon, the Hat. Woven and blocked from a material not available in any realm except the origins of wonder, the Hat, when hurled by his expert hand, instantly unfolds into a circle of blades to attack or defend.The mad odyssey begins here...",Hatter M #1,,09/01/04,October 16th 2008,['Hatter Madigan'],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179349l/3563478.jpg,3.6,[],72.0,1.0,,,,85.0,2412.0,176,Automatic Pictures,"['590', '712', '754', '273', '83']",,[],,"['Frank Beddor', 'Liz Cavalier', 'Ben Templesmith']"

Hitchcock,,"['Film', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Media Tie In', 'Art', 'History', 'Criticism', 'France', '20th Century', 'Reference']","Any book-length interview with Alfred Hitchcock is valuable, but considering that this volume's interlocutor is François Truffaut, the conversation is remarkable indeed. Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like Rear Window (""I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged""), his technical insight into Psycho's shower scene (""the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]""), and his ruminations on flops such as Under Capricorn (""If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'"").

Heretics,,"['Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Classics', 'Catholic', 'Faith', 'Essays']","G. K. Chesterton, the ""Prince of Paradox,"" is at his witty best in this collection of twenty essays and articles from the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing on ""heretics"" — those who pride themselves on their superiority to Christian views — Chesterton appraises prominent figures who fall into that category from the literary and art worlds. Luminaries such as Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and James McNeill Whistler come under the author's scrutiny, where they meet with equal measures of his characteristic wisdom and good humor.In addition to incisive assessments of well-known individuals (""Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Making the World Small"" and ""Mr. H. G. Wells and the Giants""), these essays contain observations on the wider world. ""On Sandals and Simplicity,"" ""Science and the Savages,"" ""On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of the Family,"" ""On Smart Novelists and the Smart Set,"" and ""Slum Novelists and the Slums"" reflect the main themes of Chesterton's life's work. Heretics roused the ire of some critics for censuring contemporary philosophies without providing alternatives; the author responded a few years later with a companion volume, Orthodoxy. Sardonic, jolly, and generous, both books are vintage Chesterton.He is criticizing those who hold incomplete and inadequate views about ""life, the universe, and everything."" He is, in short, criticizing all that host of non-Christian views of reality, as he demonstrated in his follow-up book Orthodoxy. The book is both an easy read and a difficult read.

Part ontological synthesis, philosophical rambling, magickal diary, visual grimoire, inspired mystical poem, revelatory/individuation process, and part alchemical vessel of expression, the book exists under the umbrella of what the author refers to as Gnostic Luciferianism. First and foremost, however, (h)Auroræ exists as an act of eternal remembrance.“This alchemical treatise walks us through a startling expression of emotive gnosis… (h)Auroræ seeks beyond and above the all-too-human condition in order to understand it, and advance it vis-à-vis a sensual Sophianic psychology, witnessed in cogitation. Mind in tandem with vision, incorporates a veiled process of subtle Jungian analysis leading to a Grail quest, of intent to remove the blindfold from the Holy Fool… A work of pilgrimage, conjunction and apotheosis, it directs the reader through pause, anticipation and intake. Sometimes rapturous, sometimes ponderous.”  (~Shani Oates, Preface to (h)Aurorae.)G. McCaughry writes:“This Opus Alchymicum is presented in a certain “light” and, at its core, (h)Auroræ is centred on the sempiternal theosophical discourse which sparks anew the Flame of Old within the heart of the predisposed reader, struggling, yet inclined, to separate the subtil from the dross so that we may uncover our inner philosophers stone or perfected being.“Tis a work of Agapae, in the purest sense of the words“This manuscript, far from being a modern-day grimoire by any means, is, primarily, a mystical handbook. A useful resource to have by ones side upon undertaking an initiatory odyssey on the Path of Exile & Exalt – regardless of which favoured system or tradition the practitioner employs.”(h)Auroræ is Gabriel McCaughrys first published manuscript, a tome which correlates directly with Anathema Publishings mandate, and his views and methodologies on alchemical book-making. This is very much a continuation in the spirit of his previous contributions to the PILLARS occult periodical (and elsewhere), but within (h)Auroræ these concepts are fully developed and actualized.“A supreme work of Beauty, in every sense of that aesthetic. A sublime work of Arte, in every sense of that metaphysic. In short, a meditational treatise of transformative alchemy of – and for – the Soul.”  (~Shani Oates)¶ Hardcover Standard Edition (limited to approx. 500 copies):5.25 x 8.5 inches. 304 pages.

Het fantoom van Alexander Wolf,,[],"Een journalist heeft er jaren later nog spijt van dat hij als jonge soldaat in de Russische burgeroorlog een man die hem in de steppe achtervolgde neerschoot, en op diens paard ontvluchtte. Wanneer hij deze gebeurtenis vele jaren later in een Engelstalige roman van een zekere Alexander Wolf tot in het kleinste detail beschreven vindt, concludeert hij dat zijn toenmalige achtervolger nog moet leven. Hij doet er alles aan om de mysterieuze auteur van het boek te vinden. Iedereen die hij ontmoet blijkt de schrijver op een andere manier te kennen, en merkwaardig genoeg is ook zijn vriendin Jelena opvallend geïnteresseerd in Wolf. Gajto Gazdanov (1903-1971) meldde zich op zestienjarige leeftijd vrijwillig bij het leger en leerde zo de verschrikkingen van de burgeroorlog kennen. Na een conflict met een meerdere belandde hij via Turkije en Bulgarije in Parijs. Aanvankelijk was hij dakloos, maar al snel vond hij werk en begon hij deel uit te maken van het literaire leven van de Russische ballingen in Frankrijk. Vanaf zijn eerste publicaties werd hij geprezen om zijn talent en in één adem genoemd met onder anderen Vladimir Nabokov.`Wie dit boek leest, houdt daarna nog meer van het leven!

Next came his only series, in which this hard-smoking, hard-drinking, all around manipulator walked the thin line of magic between this world and hell. So when Irishman Garth Ennis was asked to write this comic book, he had asked himself, ""What could I possibly do to John Constantine that hadn't been done before? And one course of action suddenly stood out above all others: Kill him."" The result is a tense supernatural drama that begins with Constantine being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Hegel's last major published work, is an attempt to systematize ethical theory, natural right, the philosophy of law, political theory, and the sociology of the modern state into the framework of Hegel's philosophy of history. Hegel's work has been interpreted in radically different ways, influencing many political movements from far right to far left, and is widely perceived as central to the communitarian tradition in modern ethical, social, and political thought.

It begins with a Preface, created after the rest of the manuscript was completed, that explains the core of his method and what sets it apart from any preceding philosophy. The Introduction, written before the rest of the work, summarizes and completes Kant's ideas on skepticism by rendering it moot and encouraging idealism and self-realization. The body of the work is divided into six sections of varying length, entitled ""Consciousness,"" ""Self-Consciousness,"" ""Reason,"" ""Spirit,"" ""Religion,"" and ""Absolute Knowledge."" A myriad of topics are discussed, and explained in such a harmoniously complex way that the method has been termed Hegelian dialectic.

Hegel's Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit,,Philosophy,"This is a new translation, with running commentary, of what is perhaps the most important short piece of Hegel's writing. The Preface to Hegel's first major work, the Phenomenology of Spirit, lays the groundwork for all his other writing by explaining what is most innovative about Hegel's philosophy. This new translation combines readability with maximum precision, breaking Hegel's long sentences and simplifying their often complex structure. At the same time, it is more faithful to the original than any previous translation. The heart of the book is the detailed commentary, supported by an introductory essay. Together they offer a lucid and elegant explanation of the text and elucidate difficult issues in Hegel, making his claims and intentions intelligible to the beginner while offering interesting and original insights to the scholar and advanced student. The commentary often goes beyond the particular phrase in the text to provide systematic context and explain related topics in Hegel and his predecessors (including Kant, Spinoza, and Aristotle, as well as Fichte, Schelling, Hölderlin, and others). The commentator refrains from playing down (as many interpreters do today) those aspects of Hegel's thought that are less acceptable in our time, and abstains from mixing his own philosophical preferences with his reading of Hegel's text. His approach is faithful to the historical Hegel while reconstructing Hegel's ideas within their own context.",,,,2005.0,,,0691120528,9780691120522,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=woV2QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.04,,,,,,,,,223.0,,,103.0,,,"['Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel', 'Yirmiyahu Yovel']"

Hardball,Are You Playing to Play Or Playing to Win?,Business & Economics,"Hardball takes leaders deep inside the world of hardball competition - a world where the players are zealously committed to winning and relentlessly driven to strengthen their competitive positions, creating a virtuous cycle that puts them far out of competitors' reach. Based on twenty-five years of experience advising and observing a range of companies, Stalk and Lachenauer reveal how hardball competitors achieve decisive victories - without bending the law and without compromising their obligations to customers and stakeholders. These companies often play rough, and they don't apologize for it. Yet they are also extraordinarily adept at the ""soft"" side of management - rallying talent and building culture through a laserlike focus on the few issues most critical to success. Using detailed and engaging stories from many industries, Hardball outlines seven classic hardball strategies: unleash massive and overwhelming force, exploit anomalies, threaten competitors' profit sanctuaries, take it and make it your own, entice competitors' into retreat, break industry compromises, and hardball M&A. The authors reveal who uses hardball strategies, under what circumstances each strategy is most effective, and how to orchestrate the attack.",,,,2004.0,,,1591391679,9781591391678,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cscGBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.49,,,,,,,,,192.0,,,82.0,,,"['George Stalk', 'Robert Lachenauer', 'John Butman']"

Her approach to writing is impossible to summarize, but many critics see a strain of American humor in her work, borne out immediately by some of the chapter titles: “Saving the Sentence,” “Arthur a Grammar,” “Regular Regularly in Narrative,” and “Finally George a Vocabulary.”Readers who have not encountered Gertrude Stein or who have had difficulty with her other work will find this book useful as an entry into her writing.

The definitive one-volume Urdu text by Ghalib Lakhnavi and Abdullah Bilgrami appeared toward the end of the nineteenth century, but English translations of this text have always been censored and abridged-until now.In Musharraf Ali Farooqi's faithful rendition, ""The Adventures of Amir Hamza"" is captured with all its colorful action, ribaldry, and fantastic elements intact. Here is the spellbinding story of Amir Hamza, the adventurer who loves Mehr-Nigar, the daughter of the Persian emperor, Naushervan. Traveling to exotic lands in the service of his emperor, Amir Hamza defeats many enemies, loves many women, and converts hundreds of infidels to the True Faith of Islam before finding his way back to his first love. Guided by a Merlin-like clairvoyant called Buzurjmehr, protected by legendary prophets, and accompanied by his loyal friend, the ingenious trickster Amar Ayyar, Amir Hamza rides his devoted winged demon-steed, Ashqar, into combat against a marvelous array of opponents, from the deadly demon, Sufaid Dev, to his own rebellious sons.Appreciated as the seminal Islamic epic or enjoyed as a sweeping tale as rich and inventive as Homer's epic sagas, ""The Adventures of Amir Hamza"" is an extraordinary creation and a true literary treasure.",,,11/06/55,October 23rd 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780679643548,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266609006l/655785.jpg,3.82,[],66.0,1.0,,,,92.0,177.0,992,Modern Library,"['46', '72', '45', '10', '4']",,[],,"['Ghalib Lakhnavi', 'Abdullah Bilgrami', 'Musharraf Ali Farooqi']"

Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life,,"['Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Academic', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Italy', 'Anthropology']","The work of Giorgio Agamben, one of Italy’s most important and original philosophers, has been based on an uncommon erudition in classical traditions of philosophy and rhetoric, the grammarians of late antiquity, Christian theology, and modern philosophy. Recently, Agamben has begun to direct his thinking to the constitution of the social and to some concrete, ethico-political conclusions concerning the state of society today, and the place of the individual within it.In Homo Sacer, Agamben aims to connect the problem of pure possibility, potentiality, and power with the problem of political and social ethics in a context where the latter has lost its previous religious, metaphysical, and cultural grounding. Taking his cue from Foucault’s fragmentary analysis of biopolitics, Agamben probes with great breadth, intensity, and acuteness the covert or implicit presence of an idea of biopolitics in the history of traditional political theory. He argues that from the earliest treatises of political theory, notably in Aristotle’s notion of man as a political animal, and throughout the history of Western thinking about sovereignty (whether of the king or the state), a notion of sovereignty as power over “life” is implicit.The reason it remains merely implicit has to do, according to Agamben, with the way the sacred, or the idea of sacrality, becomes indissociable from the idea of sovereignty. Drawing upon Carl Schmitt’s idea of the sovereign’s status as the exception to the rules he safeguards, and on anthropological research that reveals the close interlinking of the sacred and the taboo, Agamben defines the sacred person as one who can be killed and yet not sacrificed—a paradox he sees as operative in the status of the modern individual living in a system that exerts control over the collective “naked life” of all individuals.",Homo Sacer #I,,11/06/94,April 1st 1998,[],Paperback,,9780804732185,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547126393l/85826._SY475_.jpg,4.04,[],91.0,1.0,,,,92.0,4163.0,208,Stanford University Press,"['1691', '1398', '731', '234', '109']",,[],,"['Giorgio Agamben', 'Daniel Heller-Roazen']"
Hamlet's Mill,An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time,Philosophy,"Ever since the Greeks coined the language we commonly use for scientific description, mythology and science have developed separately. But what came before the Greeks? What if we could prove that all myths have one common origin in a celestial cosmology? What if the gods, the places they lived, and what they did are but ciphers for celestial activity, a language for the perpetuation of complex astronomical data? Drawing on scientific data, historical and literary sources, the authors argue that our myths are the remains of a preliterate astronomy, an exacting science whose power and accuracy were suppressed and then forgotten by an emergent Greco-Roman world view. This fascinating book throws into doubt the self-congratulatory assumptions of Western science about the unfolding development and transmission of knowledge. This is a truly seminal and original thesis, a book that should be read by anyone interested in science, myth, and the interactions between the two.",,,,1977.0,,,0879232153,9780879232153,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ql7ATHGee50C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.27,,,,,,,,,450.0,,,458.0,,,"['Giorgio de Santillana', 'Hertha von Dechend']"

It’s the best relationship advice you’ll ever receive. For ages, women have come together over coffee, cocktails, or late-night phone chats to analyze the puzzling behavior of men.

Unfortunately, guys are too terrified to ever directly tell a woman, “You're not the one.” But their actions absolutely show how they feel. Reexamining familiar scenarios and classic mindsets that keep us in unsatisfying relationships, Behrendt and Tuccillo’s wise and wry understanding of the sexes spares women hours of waiting by the phone, obsessing over the details with sympathetic girlfriends, and hoping his mixed messages really mean, “I’m in love with you and want to be with you.” He’s Just Not That Into You is provocative, hilarious, and, above all, intoxicatingly liberating. It deserves a place on every woman’s night table. It knows you’re a beautiful, smart, funny woman who deserves better.

Homer's Odyssey,,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Classics', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary']","Once in nine lives, something extraordinary happens... The last thing Gwen Cooper wanted was another cat. She already had two, not to mention a phenomenally underpaying job and a recently broken heart. Then Gwen’s veterinarian called with a story about a three-week-old eyeless kitten who’d been abandoned. It was love at first sight.Everyone warned that Homer would always be an ""underachiever,"" never as playful or independent as other cats. But the kitten nobody believed in quickly grew into a three-pound dynamo, a tiny daredevil with a giant heart who eagerly made friends with every human who crossed his path. Homer scaled seven-foot bookcases with ease and leapt five feet into the air to catch flies in mid-buzz. He survived being trapped alone for days after 9/11 in an apartment near the World Trade Center, and even saved Gwen’s life when he chased off an intruder who broke into their home in the middle of the night.But it was Homer’s unswerving loyalty, his infinite capacity for love, and his joy in the face of all obstacles that inspired Gwen daily and transformed her life. And by the time she met the man she would marry, she realized Homer had taught her the most important lesson of all: Love isn’t something you see with your eyes.Homer’s Odyssey is the once-in-a-lifetime story of an extraordinary cat and his human companion.

Meanwhile, browsing through an online memorial for Spencer put together by his classmates, Betsy Hill is struck by a photo that appears to have been taken on the night of her son's death and he wasn't alone. She thinks it is Adam Baye standing just outside the camera's range; but when Adam goes missing, it soon becomes clear that something deep and sinister has infected their community.

And that is possible, even if others remain as they are.If you’re not free now, it might be because you’ve been preoccupied with the people or institutions that you feel have restrained your freedom. I don’t expect you to stop worrying about them merely because I suggest that you do.I do hope to show you, though, that those people and institutions are relatively powerless to stop you — once you decide how you will achieve your freedom. There are things you can do to be free, and if you turn your attention to those things, no one will stand in your way. But when you become preoccupied with those who are blocking you, you overlook the many alternatives you could use to bypass them.The freedom you seek is already available to you, but it has gone unnoticed.

As Helga witnessed Nazi brutality toward her friends and neighbors and eventually her own family she began documenting her experiences in a diary. In 1941, Helga and her parents were sent to the concentration camp of Terezin, where she continued to write with astonishing insight about her daily life. Before she was sent to Auschwitz in 1944, Helga's uncle, who worked in the Terezin records department, hid her diary and drawings in a brick wall.

Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,,"['History', 'Japan', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'World History', 'War', 'Asia', 'Japanese History', 'Japanese Literature']","Winner of the Pulitzer PrizeIn this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.",,,08/22/00,September 4th 2001,['Hirohito'],Paperback,,9780060931308,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407707626l/93959.jpg,3.85,"['Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (2001)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography/Autobiography (2000)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2000)']",89.0,1.0,,,,92.0,2351.0,832,Harper Perennial,"['636', '960', '567', '134', '54']",,[],,['Herbert P.

Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.",,,June 10th 2013,June 10th 2014,['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],Hardcover,,9781476751443,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402198745l/17727276.jpg,3.61,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2014)'],35.0,1.0,,,,85.0,13069.0,788,Simon Schuster,"['3237', '4364', '3485', '1095', '888']",,[],,['Hillary Rodham Clinton']
Hiroshi Sugimoto,,"['Photography', 'Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Art and Photography']","Genius of the large-format camera, the long exposure and the silverprint, New York-based photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto has made pictures that seem to contain whole aeons of time within themselves, and suggest an infinite palette of tonal wealth in blacks, grays and whites. Many of these images have now become a part of art culture's popular image bank (as U2's use of Sugimoto's ""Boden Sea"" for the cover of their 2009 album, No Line on the Horizon, demonstrated), while simultaneously evoking photography's earliest days: ""I probably call myself a postmodern-experienced pre-postmodern modernist,"" he once joked to an interviewer. This absolutely exquisite retrospective is an expanded edition of Hatje Cantz's 2005 volume. It is the first to feature works from all of Sugimoto's series to date: his celebrated portraits of wax figures, his incredible seascapes that seem to suggest a person's first conscious view of the ocean, the extremely long exposures of theaters which elevate the white, luminescent cinema screen and transform it into a magical image of an altar and the fascinating dioramas of scientific display cases, which invite us to travel far into the past.

Howie Mandel is one of the most recognizable names in entertainment–respected by his peers and beloved by audiences as the host of the enormously popular prime-time game show Deal or No Deal. With a career that spans three decades and many different show-business platforms–he’s a renowned stand-up comedian who continues to perform more than 150 sold-out shows a year, he created the award-winning TV show Bobby’s World, he’s starred in feature films and the hit TV series St. Elsewhere, and he’s also hosted his own daytime talk show–he’s one of the most versatile performers anywhere. But there are aspects of his personal and professional life he’s never talked about publicly–until now.Eleven years ago, Mandel first told the world about his “germophobia.” He’s recently started discussing his adult ADHD as well. Now, for the first time, he reveals the details of his struggle with these challenging disorders. He catalogs his numerous fears and neuroses and shares entertaining stories about how he has tried to integrate them into his act. “If I’m making myself laugh,” he writes, “then I’m distracted from all the other things going on in my head that are, at times, torturous.” And he speaks frankly and honestly about the ways his condition has affected his personal life–as a son, husband, and father of three.Fans who’ve been dying to know “the deal” behind Mandel’s remarkable rise through the show-business ranks will be rewarded with many never-before-told anecdotes, each one generously leavened with Mandel’s trademark humor.

Kershaw's Hitler brings us closer than ever before to the character of the bizarre misfit in his 30-year ascent from a Viennese shelter for the indigent to uncontested rule over the German nation that had tried & rejected democracy in the crippling aftermath of WWI. With extraordinary vividness, Kershaw recreates the settings that made Hitler's rise possible: the virulent anti-Semitism of prewar Vienna, the crucible of a war with immense casualties, the toxic nationalism that gripped Bavaria in the 20s, the undermining of the Weimar Republic by extremists of the Right & the Left, the hysteria that accompanied Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 & then mounted in brutal attacks by his storm troopers on Jews & others condemned as enemies of the Aryan race. In an account drawing on many previously untapped sources, Hitler metamorphoses from an obscure fantasist, a drummer sounding an insistent beat of hatred in Munich beer halls, to the instigator of an infamous failed putsch &, ultimately, to the leadership of a ragtag alliance of right-wing parties fused into a movement that enthralled the German people. This volume, 1st of two, ends with the promulgation of the infamous Nuremberg laws that pushed German Jews to the outer fringes of society, & with the march of the German army into the Rhineland, Hitler's initial move toward the abyss of war.",Hitler #1,,10/30/98,April 12th 2000,['Adolf Hitler'],Paperback,,9780393320350,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389660286l/93996.jpg,4.21,['Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (1999)'],101.0,2.0,,,,93.0,5049.0,912,W.W.

Hamsunas. Svajotojas ir užkariautojas,,"['Biography', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'History']","Knutas Hamsunas (1859–1952) – garsus norvegų rašytojas, pakeitęs pasaulio literatūrą, savo romanais padaręs didžiulę įtaką ne vienai Europos ir Amerikos kūrėjų kartai. 1920 m. buvo apdovanotas Nobelio literatūros premija. Savo kūryboje jis atskleidžia nesąmoningą individo, gyvenančio tarsi už visuomenės, dvasios pasaulį. Jaučiama Nyčės filosofijos įtaka.

Hilma AF Klint: A Pioneer of Abstraction,,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Art History', 'Sweden']","Just before her death in 1944 at the age of 81, the Swedish painter and mystic Hilma af Klint stipulated that her paintings were not to be publicly exhibited for 20 years. In fact, another 40-plus years were to pass before inklings of her vast oeuvre began to reach public consciousness, with the landmark 1987 exhibition and book The Spiritual in Art. Since then, critics, artists and historians have praised her with ever-increasing awe, and today af Klint's paintings, watercolors and sketches--numbering over 1,000 in total--have never looked so contemporary, presaging as they do the works of Beatriz Milhazes, Elizabeth Murray and Tal R., and Agnes Martin, Emma Kunz and Arthur Dove before them. For af Klint herself, as a medium for an art she was despairingly unable to comprehend, contemporaneity was irrelevant: her work--much of which was dictated by a spirit guide named Ananda--unfolded in complete ignorance of Kandinsky, Malevich or Mondrian, who likewise practised an abstraction informed by theosophy and occult philosophy. Af Klint's abstractions preceded those of Kandinsky, who is usually credited with inventing abstract painting: as early as 1906, she was devising large-scale canvases filled with grids, circles, spirals and petal-like forms--sometimes diagrammatic, sometimes biomorphic. She was painting watercolor monochromes in 1916, and making automatic drawings long before the Surrealists. This monumental 280-page monograph, with 200 color plates, is the first full Hilma af Klint overview. A landmark publication, it not only reveals the moving lucidity of her art, but challenges the narrative of abstract art in the twentieth century.",,,May 31st 2013,June 30th 2013,[],Paperback,,9783775734899,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389574274l/17195164.jpg,4.63,[],44.0,1.0,,,,100.0,51.0,280,Hatje Cantz,"['35', '13', '3', '0', '0']",,[],,"['Iris Muller-Westermann', 'Pascal Rousseau', 'David Lomas', 'Hilma Af Klint']"

Suddenly, that life was over. Her husband, Josiah, announced that he was leaving her and their two young sons.When Josiah took a teaching job at a Midwestern college, Isabel and their sons moved with him from New York City to Ohio, where Isabel taught acting, threw herself into the college community, and delighted in the less-scheduled lives of toddlers raised away from the city. But within a few months, the marriage was over. The life Isabel had made crumbled.

Several bullets from a banned gun end his dream of returning the building to its former glory. With everyone around her talking about the supernatural, pragmatic Eve won't let rumors of ghosts distract her from hard evidence. The case becomes even more bizarre when it appears to be linked to the suspicious disappearance of a rock star eighty-five years ago. As Eve searches for the connection, logic clashes with the unexplainable. She may be forced to face the threat of something more dangerous than a flesh-and-blood killer.Duration: Approximately 180 min.",In Death #22.5,Unabridged,September 29th 2006,March 28th 2007,"['Eve Dallas', 'Roarke']",Audio Cassette,,9781423337188,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171163374l/89694._SY475_.jpg,4.19,[],44.0,1.0,,,,97.0,11957.0,3,Brilliance Audio,"['5338', '3949', '2260', '365', '45']",,"['New York City, New York (United States)']",,"['J.

And when the battle gets personal, their wild side is unleashed…. Ryon Hunter sees dead people—spirits that beg him for help in ways he can’t understand.

When Ryon locates Daria in the Shoshone National Park, it is almost too late, but nursing her back to health at the Alpha Pack compound brings a new complication—Daria is his destined mate, and Ryon is afraid of what will happen when she discovers what he is, and what he had to do to save her life.

Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club']","From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a powerful account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America’s white working classHillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance’s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.",,,,June 28th 2016,[],Hardcover,,9780062300546,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463569814l/27161156.jpg,3.93,"['Audie Award for Nonfiction (2017)', 'Ohioana Book Award for About Ohio or an Ohioan (2017)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2016)']",240.0,3.0,,,,93.0,302052.0,257,Harper,"['92226', '122846', '65341', '16023', '5616']",,"['Middletown, Ohio (United States)', 'New Haven, Connecticut (United States)', 'Jackson, Kentucky (United States)']",,['J.

A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.--scholastic.com",Harry Potter #3,,07/08/99,05/01/04,"['Sirius Black', 'Draco Malfoy', 'Ron Weasley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley', 'Dudley Dursley', 'Severus Snape', 'Rubeus Hagrid', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Neville Longbottom', 'Fred Weasley', 'George Weasley', 'Percy Weasley', 'Ginny Weasley', 'Colin Creevey', 'Filius Flitwick', 'Pomona Sprout', 'Arthur Weasley', 'Molly Weasley', 'Cho Chang', 'Marjorie Dursley', 'Cornelius Fudge', 'Remus Lupin', 'Sybil Trelawney', 'Peter Pettigrew', 'Poppy Pomfrey', 'Stan Shunpike', 'Oliver Wood', 'Cedric Diggory', 'Dean Thomas', 'Seamus Finnigan', 'Rolanda Hooch', 'Katie Bell', 'Ernie Prang', 'Albus Dumbledore', 'Harry Potter', 'Hermione Granger']",Mass Market Paperback,,9780439655484,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499277281l/5.jpg,4.57,"['Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers (1999)', 'Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (2000)', 'Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2000)', ""Whitbread Award for Children's Book of the Year (1999)"", ""Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature (2008)"", 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (2005)', 'Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award (2004)', 'Maine Student Book Award (2001)', 'Golden Archer Award for Intermediate (2001)', 'Indian Paintbrush Book Award (2004)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2002)', 'Hotze de Roosprijs (2001)', 'Nestlé Smarties Book Prize for 9–11 years (1999)']",247736.0,2770.0,,,,99.0,2806471.0,435,Scholastic Inc.,"['1892635', '668920', '205266', '27227', '12423']",,"['Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (United Kingdom)', 'London, England']",,"['J.

History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction,,"['History', 'Medicine', 'Nonfiction', 'Medical', 'Science', 'World History', 'Biology', 'History Of Medicine', 'Read For School', 'Textbooks']","Jacalyn Duffin's History of Medicine provides a brief survey of the history of Western medicine with reference to recent scholarly literature and current issues in health care. Organized conceptually around the major fields of medical endeavour - anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, surgery, obstetrics, psychiatry, pediatrics, and family medicine - this book is an accessible overview of medical history as a vibrant component of social, intellectual, and cultural history, and as a research discipline in its own right.Each chapter begins in antiquity and ends in the twentieth century. Throughout, Duffin shows that alternative interpretations can be found for most elements of our past and that topics of interest can go well beyond 'great men' and 'great discoveries' to include ideas, diseases, patients, institutions, and great mistakes. This approach does not mean that the 'great men' (and women) are neglected; rather they appear in context. Medical disasters such as chloramphenicol and thalidomide, are covered along with the triumphs, and examples from Canada's past, largely ignored in other medical histories, are included. A chapter on methodology, suggestions for further reading with special attention to Canadian sources, and a careful index make it possible to research a specific event or historical debate, or to satisfy a more general curiosity.By presenting the material in a structure that resonates with the broad outlines of medical training, and by focusing on the questions asked most often, this text is a relevant guide for students to the history of the profession they are about to embrace, and for those who would teach them, be they physicians or historians. Duffin's clear and entertaining prose and the many illustrations will help to demystify medicine for general readers and for students in other domains, such as history, philosophy, and sociology.",,,11/06/99,October 30th 1999,[],Paperback,,9780802079121,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396837097l/202681.jpg,4.03,"[""Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction Nominee (1999)""]",83.0,1.0,,,,96.0,93.0,384,"University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division","['30', '40', '19', '4', '0']",,[],,['Jacalyn Duffin']

Herzog & De Meuron: Natural History,,['Architecture'],"More than any of their contemporaries, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are challenging the boundaries between architecture and art. Natural History explores that challenge, examining how the work of this formidable pair has drawn upon the art of both past and present, and brought architecture into dialogue with the art of our time. Echoing an encyclopedia, this publication reflects the natural history museum structure of the exhibition which it accompanies, organized by the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Models and projects by Herzog & de Meuron, as well as by other artists, are structured around six thematic portfolios that suggest an evolutionary history of the architects' work: Appropriation & Reconstruction, Transformation & Alienation, Stacking & Compression, Imprints & Moulds, Interlocking Spaces, and Beauty & Atmosphere. Each section is introduced with a statement from Herzog, and more than 20 artists, scholars, and architects have contributed essays, including Carrie Asman, Georges Didi-Huberman, Kurt W.

Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls ""the author of the plot behind the plot."" Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world. Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world.

What constitutes a telling detail? When is a metaphor successful? Is Realism realistic? Why do some literary conventions become dated while others stay fresh?James Wood ranges widely, from Homer to Make Way for Ducklings, from the Bible to John le Carré, and his book is both a study of the techniques of fiction-making and an alternative history of the novel.

Happy Accidents,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'LGBT', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Comedy', 'Adult']","In the summer of 1974, a fourteen-year-old girl in Dolton, Illinois, had a dream. A dream to become an actress, like her idols Ron Howard and Vicki Lawrence. But it was a long way from the South Side of Chicago to Hollywood, and it didn't help that she'd recently dropped out of the school play, The Ugly Duckling. Or that the Hollywood casting directors she wrote to replied that ""professional training was a requirement.""  But the funny thing is, it all came true. Through a series of Happy Accidents, Jane Lynch created an improbable and hilarious path to success. In those early years, despite her dreams, she was also consumed with anxiety, feeling out of place in both her body and her family. To deal with her worries about her sexuality, she escaped in positive ways such as joining a high school chorus not unlike the one in Glee but also found destructive outlets. She started drinking almost every night her freshman year of high school and developed a mean and judgmental streak that turned her into a real- life Sue Sylvester. Then, at thirty-one, she started to get her life together. She was finally able to embrace her sexuality, come out to her parents, and quit drinking for good. Soon after, a Frosted Flakes commercial and a chance meeting in a coffee shop led to a role in the Christopher Guest movie Best in Show, which helped her get cast in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Similar coincidences and chance meetings led to roles in movies starring Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, and even Meryl Streep in 2009's Julie & Julia. Then, of course, came the two lucky accidents that truly changed her life. Getting lost in a hotel led to an introduction to her future wife, Lara. Then, a series she'd signed up for abruptly got canceled, making it possible for her to take the role of Sue Sylvester in Glee, which made her a megastar.  Today, Jane Lynch has finally found the contentment she thought she'd never have. Part comic memoir and part inspirational narrative, this is a book equally for the rabid Glee fan and for anyone who needs a new perspective on life, love, and success. WITH A FOREWORD BY CAROL BURNETT Excerpt from Happy Accidents:If I could go back in time and talk to my twenty-year-old self, the first thing I would say is: ""Lose the perm."" Secondly I would say: ""Relax. Really. Just relax. Don't sweat it."" I can't remember a time when I wasn't anxious and fearful that the parade would pass me by. And I was sure there was someone or something outside of myself with all the answers. I had a driving, anxiety-filled ambition. I wanted to be a working actor so badly. I wanted to belong and feel like I was valued and seen. Well, now I am a working actor, and I guarantee you it's not because I suffered or worried over it.  As I look back, the road to where I am today has been a series of happy accidents I was either smart or stupid enough to take advantage of. I thought I had to have a plan, a strategy. Turns out I just had to be ready and willing to take chances, look at what's right in front of me, and put my heart into everything I do. All that anxiety and fear didn't help, nor did it fuel anything useful. My final piece of advice to twenty-year-old me: Be easy on your sweet self. And don't drink Miller Lite tall boys in the morning.

At seven he made a PowerPoint presentation, “My Dog,” with headings like “A Childhood Without a Dog is a Sad Thing.” His parents, Janet and Rich, were steadfast; bringing a dog into their fast-paced New York City lives was utterly impractical. However, on a trip to Italy, a chance happening leads Janet to reconsider, a decision then hastened by a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Janet decides the excitement of a new puppy would  be the perfect antidote to the strain on the family of months of arduous treatments for her illness. The prospect of a new puppy would be an affirmation of life, a powerful talisman for them all. On Thanksgiving weekend, soon after the grueling months of treatments are over, Huck, a sweet, mischievous, red-haired, toy poodle joins the family and wins everyone’s heart. A few months later the family ventures to baseball’s spring training, leaving Huck with Janet’s sister in Ramsey, New Jersey.  Barely twenty-four hours into the trip, Janet receives the dreaded phone call: Huck has slipped through the backyard fence and run away.  Broken-hearted and frantic, the family catches the first plane to New Jersey to begin a search for their lost puppy. It is a race against time, for little Huck is now lost in an area entirely unfamiliar to him, facing the threat of bears and coyotes, swamps and freezing temperatures, rain and fast cars.  Moved by the family’s plight, strangers – from school children to townspeople to the police lieutenant – join the search, one that proves to be an unyielding test of determination and faith. Touching and warm-hearted, Huck is a spirit-lifting story about resilience, the generosity of strangers, and hope.",,,,September 28th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780767931342,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320546103l/7790308.jpg,3.66,[],93.0,1.0,,,,83.0,1685.0,304,Broadway Books,"['518', '428', '455', '218', '66']",,[],,['Janet Elder']

During the divorce proceedings, he and Evelyn signed a child custody bond, and Steven is demanding the money guaranteed by the bond to find Annie. The money was secured by a mortgage on Evelyn's grandmother's house, and the True Blue Bonds Bail Agency wants to take possession of the house.Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter.

Hollywood Hypocrites,,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Society', 'Cultural']","From the New York Times bestselling author of Obama Zombies comes a sharp and humorous critique of the Hollywood left.THE BOOK YOU’RE ABOUT TO READ WILL PISS YOU OFF. Are you sick of self-important celebrities preaching against “global warming,” yet flying private planes to their countless homes? Fed up with lectures about charity and philanthropy from miserly rockers who will do anything for a tax break? Disgusted by leftist stars decrying the evils of the Second Amendment as their personal bodyguards pack more heat than a Chuck Norris kick to the face? The same Hollywood loons who got Barack Hussein Obama elected in 2008 will do so again in 2012. That is, unless we muzzle them. Four years ago, Republicans sat back like wimps and let Obama’s celebrity-fueled cool machine steamroll them into electoral smithereens. This time, we must do the steamrolling. New York Times bestselling author of Obama Zombies and gonzo journalist Jason Mattera takes the first stand with Hollywood Hypocrites, as he slays the Left’s sacred celebrity cows and teaches Obama’s Tinseltown foot soldiers their most important lesson yet: No longer can they attempt to deny Americans the very liberties they use to catapult themselves to prosperity and stardom. In his trademark eye-opening, no-holds-barred, and hilarious style, Mattera puts scores of A-list celebrities, including Sting, Madonna, Bono, Al Gore, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Cameron Diaz, Bruce Springsteen, and many, many more under the microscope to analyze whether they live by the same environmental, health, anti-violence, civil rights, and other policy prescriptions they seek to inflict on Americans. What he uncovers will shock you. Hollywood’s megaphone is powerful, and the mainstream media’s love affair with the president will roar back with a vengeance when their guy is against the wall. Anyone who thinks Barack Obama’s abysmal first term will be enough to demoralize the Liberal Left Coast from flexing its mediated political muscle is a fool. It’s time to recognize the marketing and fund-raising power the Hollywood Progressives wield. It’s time to dig into the data and set the record straight. It’s time to turn the media spotlight back on the image makers and prevent the Hollywood elite from hoodwinking American voters once again.",,,,March 13th 2012,[],Hardcover,,9781451625615,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344392408l/13260238.jpg,3.75,[],100.0,1.0,,,,90.0,202.0,272,Threshold Editions,"['55', '69', '57', '14', '7']",,[],,['Jason Mattera']

Harriet Tubman: The Life and the Life Stories,,"['Biography', 'History']","    Harriet Tubman’s name is known world-wide and her exploits as a self-liberated Underground Railroad heroine are celebrated in children’s literature, film, and history books, yet no major biography of Tubman has appeared since 1943. Jean M. Humez’s comprehensive Harriet Tubman is both an important biographical overview based on extensive new research and a complete collection of the stories Tubman told about her life—a virtual autobiography culled by Humez from rare early publications and manuscript sources. This book will become a landmark resource for scholars, historians, and general readers interested in slavery, the Underground Railroad, the Civil War, and African American women.    Born in slavery in Maryland in or around 1820, Tubman drew upon deep spiritual resources and covert antislavery networks when she escaped to the north in 1849. Vowing to liberate her entire family, she made repeated trips south during the 1850s and successfully guided dozens of fugitives to freedom. During the Civil War she was recruited to act as spy and scout with the Union Army. After the war she settled in Auburn, New York, where she worked to support an extended family and in her later years founded a home for the indigent aged. Celebrated by her primarily white antislavery associates in a variety of private and public documents from the 1850s through the 1870s, she was rediscovered as a race heroine by woman suffragists and the African American women’s club movement in the early twentieth century. Her story was used as a key symbolic resource in education, institutional fundraising, and debates about the meaning of ""race"" throughout the twentieth century.    Humez includes an extended discussion of Tubman’s work as a public performer of her own life history during the nearly sixty years she lived in the north. Drawing upon historiographical and literary discussion of the complex hybrid authorship of slave narrative literature, Humez analyzes the interactive dynamic between Tubman and her interviewers. Humez illustrates how Tubman, though unable to write, made major unrecognized contributions to the shaping of her own heroic myth by early biographers like Sarah Bradford. Selections of key documents illustrate how Tubman appeared to her contemporaries, and a comprehensive list of primary sources represents an important resource for scholars.",,,,November 19th 2003,[],Hardcover,,9780299191207,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347495247l/886232.jpg,3.85,[],14.0,1.0,,,,92.0,13.0,488,University of Wisconsin Press,"['4', '4', '4', '1', '0']",,[],,['Jean M.

Now, in Half Broke Horses, she brings us the story of her grandmother, told in a first-person voice that is authentic, irresistible, and triumphant. ""Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did."" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (""I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place"") and fly a plane. And, with her husband Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit.

Hard Wired: A Crash Course in Small College Football,,"['Sports', 'Nonfiction']","This work reveals competitive strategy and insider knowledge of college football, college life and the grass roots evolution of politics that began in academia and now shapes the political aspects of our everyday life. This fast paced, biographical work contains layers of storyline with twists and turns that are poignant, and startling.Join three young men’s true stories as they launch themselves onto the college football scene and refuse to be denied their impact both on and off the field. These mistakenly overlooked college football players take over a struggling football team with their drive and motivation, all in an effort to rise to the challenge of one more football season. Living on the edge of college life as driven athletes, they face a dramatic conspiracy as they struggle in the face of athletic romance, real world politics of organizational behavior and creating their own futures as they are forced to lead the world around them much sooner than they ever expected.Heavy is the head that wears the crown as these extraordinary athletes have decisions to make that are crowded by circumstances that continually provide opportunities for them to fail in rising to the level of achievement that they know they have earned. Understanding their romantic interests and hearing their sex stories as they struggle not to be dragged under provides a highly insightful gaze into their world.The dynamics of college football, deciding on a future and motivation for achievement are illustrated here in a true story of the thin line between being an exceptional football player and the ever expanding world of claims that all performers are equal despite the results that prove to differentiate those same performers. At a new school, on a new team, joining the college ranks, these young men face more reality than they anticipated as they hold their future in their own hands and are first hand participants in the real world evolution of organizational politicking, power struggles and the freedom to pursue the college endeavor as they see fit. This true story is worth picking up simply to have an accurate overview of the inner workings and value of university education, college football and organizational manipulation. It serves as both a remarkable story of college life and as an instruction manual to the pitfalls of the people surrounding exceptional individuals, in addition to the political motivations of higher education organizations. College football, coaching motivations and the nature of organizational leaders is clearly depicted here as your guide.

Hemingway,A Biography,Literary Collections,"Distinguished by its precision, its graceful use of language, and its resonant depth, the innovative style of Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) radically altered literary conventions and influenced generations of writers. In The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea, and numerous short stories, he explored such universal themes as stoicism in adversity, as well as our futile struggles against nature and mortality.This evocative, sympathetic biography illuminates the events that informed Hemingway's vigorous life: an accident-prone youth and early rivalry with his father; his experiences in World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II; his stormy relationships with writers and women; his sudden fame, slow decline, and suicide.

How to Make Love Like a Porn Star,A Cautionary Tale,Biography & Autobiography,"When the stewardess brought me off the plane in a wheelchair, I lowered my head. I was too scared to even look at my father. I didn't want to see the disappointment and horror on his face. All that hate I had accumulated for him over the years, all the resentment against him for not understanding what I was going through, just released with the tears. ""So, where are your parents?"" the stewardess asked me after a few minutes. ""I can't wait here with you much longer."" I looked up and wiped my eyes. My father was standing ten feet away. He didn't even recognize me. In the underbelly of Las Vegas, a cesspool of warring biker gangs and seedy strip clubs transformed the gawky, brace-faced Jenna Massoli into the bombshell Jenna Jameson. Today, Jenna Jameson is the biggest star in the history of adult movies, consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful women alive. But behind the glamour and the meteoric rise to fame was a path paved with tragedy and heartbreak. As a teenager drawn into a chaotic world ruled by rape, abuse, and murder, Jenna plunged into a downward spiral of addiction, even as she became one of the most photographed women in adult magazines. Determined to overcome this past, Jenna rebounded in the adult-film business, where she encountered sadistic directors, experienced lovers of both sexes, amorous celebrities (from Howard Stern to Marilyn Manson to Tommy Lee), bitter rival starlets, and finally, glory, as she went on to become the biggest porn star the world has ever seen. But her struggle for happiness did not end when the accolades began. For years she wrestled with her resentment at her estranged father, the loneliness of growing up from the age of two without a mother, and her enduring childhood desire to find a man who could give her the security and love she never had. Her unforgettable memoir is many things at once: a shocking sexual history, an insider's guide to the secret workings of the billion-dollar adult-film industry, and a gripping thriller that probes deep into Jenna's dark past. An unparalleled exploration of sexual freedom, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ventures far beyond the flesh, into the heart-shredding tragedies and adrenaline-pumping triumphs of a woman who has already lived a hundred lifetimes. Always witty and humorous even as she faces the demons of her past, Jenna offers hilarious anecdotes about one of the most controversial businesses in history, and shares outrageous advice, including her ten commandments of dating and sex, how to become a ""suitcase pimp,"" and how to make it in the business as a female (or a male).

After a failed courtship, Tyler thought the best he could hope for in a wife was mere companionship. But spirited Beth is the one he longs to protect, and hold close. Earning her trust is the hardest thing he's ever had to do. And soon, both will discover that forgiveness and understanding are gifts that only rekindled faith--along with the happiest of holidays--can bring.

Hitler,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Germany', 'Politics', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'German Literature', 'Nazi Party']","A bestseller in its original German edition and subsequently translated into more than a dozen languages, Joachim Fest's Hitler has become a classic portrait of a man, a nation, and an era. Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man's and a nation's rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post-World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the scope of his projects and the theatricality of their presentation. Fest also, perhaps most importantly, brilliantly uncovers the destructive personality who aimed at and achieved devastation on an unprecedented scale.

There, seventeen-year-old Wilhelmina started a seamstress business and kept cows on a vacant city lot.Wilhelmina was, above all things, a passionate social reformer. She encountered American society first during the Civil War, a time of great social unrest. Her involvement with the Colored Orphan Asylum put her in the center of the New York City Draft Riots, the largest uprising in the history of the United States.Wilhelmina's story inspired Kelly, who fleshed out the few hard facts she could find with a lovingly researched fictional visit to a long-lost time and place in America's history.""Joanna Kelly...draws special strength from her Quaker faith as well as her insatiable thirst for history in writing her first novel, ""Hooligan's Alley.""

The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet...but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him...yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy. Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose ""the better part""-a joyful life of ""living-room"" intimacy with him that flows naturally into ""kitchen service"" for him. How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.

Five years later the past has found her and to protect herself and her beloved child she'll have to perform one last act of dazzling daring more audacious than any she has previously attempted.With her internationally bestselling novels Chocolat, Blackberry Wine, Five Quarters of the Orange, and Coastliners, Joanne Harris has woven intoxicating spells that celebrate the sensuous while exposing the passion, secrets and folly beneath the surface of rustic village life.

After the birth of her daughter, she takes up the veil, and a new name, Soeur Auguste. But the peace she has found in remote isolation is shattered five years later by the events that follow the death of her kind benefactress, the Reverend Mother. When a new abbess -- the daughter of a corrupt noble family elevated by the murder of King Henri IV -- arrives at Sainte Marie-de-la-mer, she does not arrive alone. With her is her personal confessor and spiritual guide, Père Colombin, a man Soeur Auguste knows all too well. For the newcomer is Guy LeMerle, a charlatan and seducer now masquerading as a priest, and the one man she fears more than any other. Soeur Auguste has a secret. Once she was l'Ailée, ""The Winged One,"" star performer of a troupe led by LeMerle, before betrayal forced her to change her identity. But now the past has found her. Before long, thanks to LeMerle, suspicion and debauchery are breeding like a plague within the convent's walls -- fueled by dark rumors of witchcraft, part of the false priest's brilliantly orchestrated scheme of revenge.

Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he's usually right.But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms:

How to Argue like Jesus: Learning Persuasion from History's Greatest Communicator,,"['Christianity', 'Leadership', 'Communication', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian']","Uses Jesus' words and actions found in the New Testament to systematically evaluate his rhetorical stylings, drawing real lessons from his teachings that today's readers can employ. Jesus of Nazareth never wrote a book, held political office, or wielded a sword. He never gained sway with the mighty or influential. He never took up arms against the governing powers in Rome. He was a lower-class worker who died an excruciating death at the age of thirty-three. Yet, in spite of all odds-obscurity, powerlessness, and execution-his words revolutionized human history. How to Argue like Jesus examines the life and words of Jesus and describes the various ways in which he sought-through the spoken word, his life, and his disciples-to reach others with his message. The authors then pull some very simple rhetorical lessons from Jesus' life that readers can use today.

Healthy at 100: The Scientifically Proven Secrets of the World's Healthiest and Longest-Lived Peoples,,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Food', 'Nutrition', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Vegan', 'Fitness', 'Medical', 'Personal Development']","Why do some people age in failing health and sadness, while others grow old with vitality and joy?
  
In this revolutionary book, bestselling author John Robbins presents us with a bold new paradigm of aging, showing us how we can increase not only our lifespan but also our health span. Through the example of four very different cultures that have the distinction of producing some of the world’s healthiest, oldest people, Robbins reveals the secrets for living an extended and fulfilling life in which our later years become a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness. From Abkhasia in the Caucasus south of Russia, where age is beauty, and Vilcabamba in the Andes of South America, where laughter is the greatest medicine, to Hunza in Central Asia, where dance is ageless, and finally the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa, the modern Shangri-la, where people regularly live beyond a century, Robbins examines how the unique lifestyles of these peoples can influence and improve our own.Bringing the traditions of these ancient and vibrantly healthy cultures together with the latest breakthroughs in medical science, Robbins reveals that, remarkably, they both point in the same direction. The result is an inspirational synthesis of years of research into healthy aging in which Robbins has isolated the characteristics that will enable us to live long and–most important–joyous lives. With an emphasis on simple, wholesome, but satisfying fare, and the addition of a manageable daily exercise routine, many people can experience great improvement in the quality of their lives now and for many years to come. But perhaps more surprising is Robbins’ discovery that it is not diet and exercise alone that helps people to live well past one hundred. The quality of personal relationships is enormously important. With startling medical evidence about the effects of our interactions with others, Robbins asserts that loneliness has more impact on lifespan than such known vices as smoking. There is clearly a strong beneficial power to love and connection.“We all have the tools to live longer lives, and to remain active, productive, and resourceful until the very end,” Robbins writes.

How We Decide,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Business', 'Neuroscience', 'Self Help', 'Economics', 'Brain', 'Sociology', 'Personal Development']","The first book to use the unexpected discoveries of neuroscience to help us make the best decisions.Since Plato, philosophers have described the decision-making process as either rational or emotional: we carefully deliberate, or we “blink” and go with our gut. But as scientists break open the mind’s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they’re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason—and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, it’s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when we’re picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.Jonah Lehrer arms us with the tools we need, drawing on cutting-edge research as well as the real-world experiences of a wide range of “deciders”—from airplane pilots and hedge fund investors to serial killers and poker players.Lehrer shows how people are taking advantage of the new science to make better television shows, win more football games, and improve military intelligence. His goal is to answer two questions that are of interest to just about anyone, from CEOs to firefighters: How does the human mind make decisions?

How Not to Be Wrong: The Hidden Maths of Everyday Life,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Philosophy', 'Education', 'Personal Development', 'Popular Science']","The Freakonomics of math—a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands The math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot through with it.   Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer?   How Not to Be Wrong presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God.   Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way.

Mencken, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Bertrand Russell, Lionel Trilling, Chiua Achebe, and Philip Gourevitch""Heart of Darkness,"" which appeared at the very beginning of our century, was a Cassandra cry announcing the end of Victorian Europe, on the verge of transforming itself into the Europe of violence,"" wrote the critic Czeslaw Milosz.        Originally published in 1902, Heart of Darkness remains one of this century's most enduring--and harrowing--works of fiction. Written several years after Conrad's grueling sojourn in the Belgian Congo, the novel tells the story of Marlow, a seaman who undertakes his own journey into the African jungle to find the tormented white trader Kurtz. Rich in irony and spellbinding prose, Heart of Darkness is a complex meditation on colonialism, evil, and the thin line between civilization and barbarity. This edition contains selections from Conrad's Congo Diary of 1890--the first notes, in effect, for the novel which was composed at the end of that decade.Virginia Woolf wrote of Conrad, ""His books are full of moments of vision.

Here is the free-spending landowner whose debts to English merchants instilled him with a prickly resentment of imperial power.

How to Choose the Best Laptop for a Writer?: A Guide for Selecting a Notebook or Tablet for Writing,,[],"Are you someone who writes a lot? If so, you probably faced the issue of eye fatigue after a long time working at the laptop. Or you struggled with the slow startup, uncomfortable keyboard, or noisy cooling fan of your laptop. In addition, you probably do not work all the time at your desk but want to use your laptop on the go.  To overcome all those issues and meet other specific requirements of persons writing a lot, a thoughtful selection of a laptop or tablet is necessary. It turns out that choosing the right laptop for a writer becomes quite hard when considering different requirements at the same time. In this guide, I help you to cope with that issue. I provide numerous advises on how to choose the best laptop or tablet for writing.  All recommendations given in this book have been developed over many years of tests and trials. As a Ph.D., computer scientist, software developer, and a writer, I personally checked a number of laptops and tablets. Frankly, I am a passionate user of them.  In contrast to numerous advice available on the Web, in this guide, I accurately justify all my recommendations. Thanks to those justifications, you will be able to evaluate by yourself how the actual conditions in which you work affect technical properties that your laptop or tablet should possess. Thus, you will be able to choose the best laptop or tablet for you.  I also assess in this guide the impact of different technical properties on the price of laptops and tablets. Using that information, it will be easier for you to decide to which particular property you are sticking to, and which you are ready to give up, due to the increased price of the device.  You may have your own idea about a laptop or tablet most suitable for writing. In spite of that, I strongly recommend you to confront your expectations with mine. In this guide, I indicate numerous specific requirements you might have not considered yet. In addition, it is always worth it to verify or supplement your preferences before making a final decision to buy an often expensive device.  Let me underline that in this guide, I do not use any brand names, names of laptops, tablets or companies producing them. Instead, I provide specific technical properties which the laptop or tablet suitable for writing should possess.  The chapters of this guide are ordered in accordance with the priorities, which in my opinion should be given to individual properties of the laptop or tablet suitable for writers. In this way, while reading the following chapters, you will be able to gradually precise your requirements regarding screen type and size, type of the processor, disk, keyboard and other.  The conclusion coming from all given advices are two recommended specifications: one for the laptop and second for the tablet. Both specifications which I present in the last chapter of this guide should meet the writers’ expectations.

Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism,,"['History', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'World History']","Socialism was man's most ambitious attempt to supplant religion with a doctrine claiming to ground itself in 'science'. Indeed, no religion ever spread so far so fast. Yet while socialism had established itself as a fact of life by the beginning of the 20th century, it did not create societies of abundance or give birth to 'the New Man'. Each failure inspired new searches for the path to the promised land: revolution, communes, social democracy, Communism, Fascism, Third World socialism. None worked, and some exacted staggering human tolls. Then, after two hundred years of wishful thinking and fitful governance, socialism suddenly imploded in a fin du siecle drama of falling walls and collapsing regimes. This book traces this fiery trajectory through sketches of the thinkers and leaders who developed the theory, led it to power, and presided over its collapse.

Healing Water: A Hawaiian Story,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical']","Nineteenth-century Hawai'i. Thirteen-year-old Pia's life is forever changed by leprosy. Pia has never known his real father. But Kamaka, a family friend, has taught him how to work, explore, and take on physical challenges. Pia believes Kamaka is fearless. He never suspects that a time will come when Kamaka could actually be afraid of him. Neither does he expect his own body to betray him, or his government to tear him from his family and send him into exile. When Pia finds himself abandoned on Moloka’i, in Hawai’i's leprosy settlement, he turns to the skills he learned from Kamaka to help him survive. But the conditions are harsh. Pia discovers that he must choose between lawlessness and aloha, revenge and forgiveness, his own willfulness and the example of someone worthy of being like a father. This fictional account was inspired by the experiences of the many Hawaiians who were sent to Moloka’is isolated Kalaupapa peninsula starting in 1866 and by the life of Father Damien deVeuster, who chose to live and work there in the late 1800s. The author conducted extensive research, working with experts and visiting the leprosy settlement.Suddenly I felt my power. Kamaka wanted my friendship. But I did not want his.    I looked at him and smiled a slow, taunting smile. Then I poured the water down the side of the mountain and watched it turn into a cool stream. It rippled over the rocks like an old song. But it was not a happy sound.""Swim by yourself, Kamaka,"" I said.

Himmelweg,,['Plays'],"A primera vista, ""Himmelweg"" es una obra de teatro histórico. En realidad, es -quiere ser- una obra acerca de la actualidad. Habla de un hombre que se parece a casi toda la gente que conozco: tiene una sincera voluntad de ayudar a los demás; quiere ser solidario; le espanta el dolor ajeno. Sin embargo, también como casi toda la gente que conozco, ese hombre no es lo bastante fuerte para desconfiar de lo que le dicen y le muestran. No es lo bastante fuerte para ver con sus propios ojos y nombrar con sus propias palabras. Se conforma con las imágenes que otros le dan. Y con las palabras que otros le dan. ""Camino-del-cielo"", por ejemplo. No es lo bastante fuerte para descubrir que ""Camino del cielo"" puede ser el nombre del infierno. No es lo bastante fuerte para ver el infierno que se extiende bajo sus pies. Un delegado de la Cruz Roja al que se encarga inspeccionar un campo de concentración y ante el que se presenta una mentira aceptable. Ese personaje fue mi punto de partida. Pero siguiendo sus pasos en ese viaje por un infierno que no lo parece, encontré a otros personajes no menos actuales, no menos cercanos. Para empezar, el conductor de la representación, el comandante del campo. Tiene ante sí la ocasión de realizar el más ambicioso sueño que ningún director de escena concibió jamás: la obra de arte total. Pero la perfección de esa obra exige de él que sólo piense en el arte y en nada más. Que deseche cualquier rasgo de compasión en su mirada. Entonces sí, entonces todas las vidas reunidas en el campo estarán a su completa disposición, como muñecos en manos del titiritero. Entre esas vidas amenazadas está la del hombrecillo que sirve al comandante de portavoz ante sus actores. Ese hombre ha de soportar una responsabilidad enorme. No sabe si está trabajando por la salvación de su pueblo o si está cooperando con los verdugos. Si está ganando tiempo o si está entregando a su gente a un destino peor que la muerte.

  Life has never been easy for Dr. Samantha Malone especially since the day all those years ago that her family was taken in a tragic car accident. Now at almost twenty-nine years old and an aspiring surgeon, she is faced with putting her life back together once again after being kidnapped and left for dead. Had it not been for six feet two inches of walking muscle in ripped jeans and worn cowboy boots with crystal blue eyes and a cheeky grin that made her wonder what he was up to, she might never have seen the light of day.

Fear is not something the fierce Dragon Guardsman is used to feeling but it is something he has become accustomed to over the last seven months. Fear that he will not catch the traitor and his cohorts before they hurt those he cares most deeply for. Fear that he will not be able to protect the one the Universe made especially for him. Fear that he is not what Samantha needs but then…

  Lance has spent his long life cracking jokes and making fun of his brethren as each succumbed to the sappiness of everlasting love with the one that completes them like no other. Now the Universe is the one laughing and his fellow Guardsmen are the ones making jokes as the mating call of his kin and his dragon push him headlong towards the one that will bring light to his soul in this life and the next. He can no longer deny that he is meant to spend the rest of his many years with Sam but his obligation to eliminate any threats to her life must come first…right? For the Guardsman who has hot-dogged his way through one hundred and twelve years, one brown-eyed curly-headed doctor will make him rethink everything he ever knew!

And the growing attraction between them will threaten their lives—Ian is a sworn enemy of the House.In Silent Bend, people disappear, the threat of a demented King and the legend of his resurrecting Queen hang over everyone’s heads, and proving loyalty means far more than blood.

In this book you will find the whole biblical rationale for the postmillennial hope, from its incipient beginning in Genesis to its glorious conclusion in Revelation. Your faith will be re-invigorated as you begin to recognize that ""the gospel is the power of God unto salvation"" (Rom 1:16) and that our Lord Jesus really meant it when he commanded us to ""go and make disciples of all the nations"" (Matt 28:19).The Third edition includes an enlarged appendix on the Errors of Hyper-preterism; both theological and exegetical.",,,01/01/09,Published,[],Paperback,,9781597524940,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373360962l/2058227.jpg,4.35,[],76.0,1.0,,,,96.0,144.0,619,Wipf & Stock Publishers,"['77', '49', '12', '3', '3']",,[],,['Kenneth L.

Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror.

Heavy: An American Memoir,,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'Anti Racist', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'African American', 'Social Justice', 'Essays']","In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.",,,,October 16th 2018,[],Hardcover,,9781501125652,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517524042l/29430746._SY475_.jpg,4.44,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Christopher Isherwood Prize for Autobiographical Prose (2018)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)']",98.0,1.0,,,,97.0,24304.0,241,Scribner,"['14246', '7521', '1763', '462', '312']",,[],,['Kiese Laymon']

In this book Dr. Gubacs describes the major expected and unexpected life transitions and their key components.

The book brilliantly probes the psychodynamics of alienation, obsession, and self-destruction, painting an unforgettable portrait of a man driven by forces beyond his control to the edge of the abyss.

We In the midst of the darkest epoch season in human history, Jesus Christ had the audacity to teach us a prayer so powerful that it defies human reason. It would be forever remembered as “The Lord’s Prayer.” Jesus turned to his tattered brigade of spiritual warriors and said, “Pray that My Father’s kingdom would come and His will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.”           Was this prayer a sort of wish upon a star, intended to be prayed by billions, but only to be experienced by a few in some distant eternity? Is the earth eroding, or is it evolving? Is global warming the beginning of the intense heat that will reduce our world to a hot rock spinning hopelessly through space? Will evil finally triumph over good, leaving terrorism to ravage the righteous, rape the innocent, and pillage our children? Will some maniac dictator finally push the button and blow us into obliteration?         The purpose of this book is to unearth the ancient mysteries that answer these questions and prepares the Church for a revolution that transforms every realm of society. God wants heaven to invade earth so that earth will look like heaven.

Seth is controlling and all they seem to do anymore is fight. If that’s what love is, Hanna doesn’t want any part of it. Besides, she has something else on her mind: graduation. But she’s been ignoring the school’s community service requirement, and now she needs to rack up some hours in a hurry.Hanna volunteers as a caretaker for her neighbor Mrs. Schoenmaker—an elderly woman with advanced Parkinson’s whose husband can’t always be there to watch over her.

It includes lots of cursing, descriptive sex, biting sarcasm, and dark themes. HYDE was inspired by Stevenson's novella but is not a retelling, in part because he and this author have very different definitions of 'bad boy'.Honesty is impossible when you don't know the truth to begin with.Mitchell Turner is everything women want most in a man--he's charismatic, successful, and undeniably gorgeous. But he's not a man--he's a monster. By venting his rage 24/7, Mitch keeps people out of the danger zone that surrounds him. But, after the most incredible night of his life, he realizes that might not be possible. Except the woman he wakes up with claims she doesn't remember any of it. And that kind of thing can make a guy insecure.Eden Colfax is kind, loyal, honest to a fault, and cavity-inducing sweet. To rid herself of the monsters that haunted her broken childhood, Eden doesn't lie, doesn't curse, and definitely never wakes up naked in strangers' beds...until the day she does. Then the flashbacks start--places she's never been, people she's never met, blood she's never spilled. And the only person with any answers is a man she never wants to see again.What they don't know is that someone is manipulating them, determined to find out exactly what they're capable of. And when the truth leaves them nothing to hold onto, they will be forced into a partnership neither expected. Or wanted.But in life, who you trust is as important as who you are. And when you can't even trust yourself, sometimes the only person you can rely on is the last person on earth you should be falling for.","Hyde, #1",,,July 8th 2012,"['Nick Landon', 'Mitchell Turner', 'Eden Colfax', 'Carter Poole', 'Jolie Cabot']",Kindle Edition,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1570228342l/15734163.jpg,3.75,[],186.0,2.0,,,,87.0,3768.0,378,Off The Hook Publishing,"['1100', '1296', '874', '335', '163']",,[],,['Lauren Stewart']

Eight months later the Bolsheviks stood at the helm. They were little known to anybody when the year began, and their leaders were still under indictment for state treason when they came to power. You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people. It is clear that the events of 1917, whatever you think of them, deserve study.”—Leon Trotsky, from History of the Russian RevolutionRegarded by many as among the most powerful works of history ever written, this book offers an unparalleled account of one of the most pivotal and hotly debated events in world history. This book reveals, from the perspective of one of its central actors, the Russian Revolution’s profoundly democratic, emancipatory character.Originally published in three parts, Trotsky’s masterpiece is collected here in a single volume. It serves as the most vital and inspiring record of the Russian Revolution to date.“[T]he greatest history of an event that I know.”—C. L. R. James“In Trotsky all passions were aroused, but his thought remained calm and his vision clear.... His involvement in the struggle, far from blurring his sight, sharpens it.... The History is his crowning work, both in scale and power and as the fullest expression of his ideas on revolution.

Hannibal,Enemy Of Rome,History,"In the year 216 B.C., Hannibal of Carthage, faced with an opposing Roman army twice the size of his own, outwitted the enemy at Cannae by means of a strategy which has become a classic of its kind. As a result of his famous ”double pincer” maneuver, 70,000 Roman soldiers died within the space of a few hours on a field the size of New York's Central Park. Yet, as devastating and startling as Cannae was, it was only one of a long list of incredible achievements. Hannibal's fantastic 1,000-mile march across the Alps from Spain to Italy was one of the wonders of ancient times. He began his hazardous journey with 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants. By the time he reached the Valley of the Po, more than 30,000 troops and many of his elephants had perished, but he still managed to stay in Italy for sixteen years.Blending biography and military adventure, Hannibal is a portrait of a military genius who was also a highly civilized man. The son of Hamilcar Barca, a famous general in his own right, Hannibal was a student of the Greek classics. But his father's lifelong grudge against Rome fostered in the son a deep hatred for that Republic and a fierce determination to subdue it forever. This resulted in the bloody battles of Lake Trasimene, Campania, Nole, Capua, and Zama, all of which Leonard Cottrell describes with vigor and authority. In gathering material for Hannibal, Cottrell traveled the entire route that Hannibal took across the Alps, thus bringing to his account a valuable firsthand knowledge of his subject. With the drama and authenticity for which he is famous, Leonard Cottrell describes Hannibal's amazing campaign—a saga of victory after victory which fell just short of its ultimate goal: the annihilation of Rome.",,,,1992.0,,,0306804980,9780306804984,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TZLStAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.89,,,,,,,,,248.0,,,128.0,,,['Leonard Cottrell']

Hardy Californians: A Woman's Life with Native Plants,,"['Nonfiction', 'Gardening', 'Horticulture']","Lester G. E. Rowntree (1879-1979), free-spirited adventurer and pioneering botanist, was fifty-two when she traded a comfortable home for the life of a peripatetic traveler in the California mountains, deserts, and forests. Through hundreds of magazine and journal articles, two acclaimed books, and uncounted public lectures, Rowntree shared her vast knowledge of California native plants and at the same time argued passionately for the protection of the state's bountiful flora. A mountain mystic who worshipped on Sierra peaks, bathed in alpine streams, and lived for months on beans and bread, Rowntree has remained an inspiration in native plant horticulture and plant conservation to this day.A beloved classic first published in 1936, Hardy Californians is Rowntree's poetic sketch of California and its plant life. In charming prose, she takes us along on her annual seed-collecting journey through the state and gives a concise introduction to the complexities of California flora, climate, and geography. The book also gives information on the suitability of many native California plants for the garden.

How We Live and Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Popular Science', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Genetics']","Biologist Lewis Wolpert eloquently narrates the basics of human life through the lens of its smallest component—the cell. Everything about our existence—movement and memory, imagination and reproduction, birth and, ultimately, death—is governed by our cells. They are the basis of all life in the universe, from the tiniest bacteria to the most complex animals. In the tradition of the classic Lives of a Cell, but with the benefit of the latest research, internationally acclaimed embryologist Lewis Wolpert demonstrates how human life derives from a single cell and then grows into a body, an incredibly complex society made up of billions of them. When we age, our cells cannot repair the damage they have undergone; when we get ill, it is because cells are so damaged they stop working and die. Wolpert examines the science behind topics that are much discussed but rarely understood—stem cell research, cloning, DNA, mutating cancer cells—and explains how all life evolved from just one cell. Lively and passionate, this is an accessible guide to understanding the human body and life itself. .",,,01/01/09,October 19th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780393072211,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347691433l/7005615.jpg,3.58,[],88.0,1.0,,,,88.0,267.0,256,W.

Not only does Seph know rather more about Vivian's disappearance than the other witches realize, but the epic struggle she's just survived has left her with some highly unusual powers--ones that could be dangerous to reveal. Despite her reluctance, she agrees to participate, if only to prevent snooty Hunter Hopewell, an obnoxious but talented witch, from ending up in the winner's circle. Can Seph hide her secrets--including her connection to the master vampire-wizard Menessos--from the terrifyingly wise judges? Plus, there's her rock 'n' roll werewolf boyfriend, Johnny, and some angry fairies to deal with....Once the competition begins, a finalist turns up dead. It looks as if one of the contestants is willing to do anything--including murder--to win. Suddenly Seph has even more on her plate than she thought, from solving a murder to working out what her new powers really are...and exactly why they're creating so much havoc in her love life.",Persephone Alcmedi #2,,12/14/09,December 29th 2009,[],Paperback,,9781439156780,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388879396l/6329337.jpg,3.88,[],90.0,1.0,,,,94.0,2417.0,384,Pocket Books,"['653', '988', '630', '114', '32']",,[],,['Linda Robertson']

But shadows are falling on the usually festive season for Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté de Québec. Most of his best agents have left or been transferred out of the Homicide Department; his old friend and lieutenant Jean-Guy Beauvoir hasn't spoken to him in months; and hostile forces are lining up against him. When Gamache receives a message from Myrna Landers, in the village of Three Pines, he welcomes the chance to get away from the city for a few hours.

As events come to a head at the Sûreté, Gamache is drawn ever deeper into the world of Three Pines.

Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,,"['Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Business', 'History', 'Finance', 'Psychology', 'Money']","In the foreword to 
  Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,
 Mises explains complex market phenomena as ""the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid undesired consequences."" It is individual choices in response to personal subjective value judgments that ultimately determine market phenomena—supply and demand, prices, the pattern of production, and even profits and losses. Although governments may presume to set ""prices,"" it is individuals who, by their actions and choices through competitive bidding for money, products, and services, actually determine ""prices"". Thus, Mises presents economics—not as a study of material goods, services, and products—but as a study of human actions. He sees the science of human action, praxeology, as a science of reason and logic, which recognizes a regularity in the sequence and interrelationships among market phenomena. Mises defends the methodology of praxeology against the criticisms of Marxists, socialists, positivists, and mathematical statisticians.Mises attributes the tremendous technological progress and the consequent increase in wealth and general welfare in the last two centuries to the introduction of liberal government policies based on free-market economic teachings, creating an economic and political environment which permits individuals to pursue their respective goals in freedom and peace. Mises also explains the futility and counter-productiveness of government attempts to regulate, control, and equalize all people's circumstances: ""Men are born unequal and ... it is precisely their inequality that generates social cooperation and civilization.""Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.Bettina Bien Greaves is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as Human Events, Reason, and The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty. A student of Mises, Greaves has become an expert on his work in particular and that of the Austrian School of economics in general. She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.",,,10/28/40,March 14th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780865976306,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564757597l/81912._SX318_.jpg,4.32,[],300.0,3.0,,,,94.0,3405.0,1128,Liberty Fund Inc.,"['1960', '883', '349', '120', '93']",,[],,"['Ludwig von Mises', 'Bettina Bien Greaves']"

This was the time when the Artefacts of Power were created, and lives were torn apart by the Mage Wars. In those days, the Magefolk were comprised of four disparate races: the human Wizards, masters of earth magic; the winged Skyfolk, who controlled the magic of air; the Leviathan, who ruled the powers of the watery realms; and the great Dragonfolk, whose province was the magic of fire.

Healing Naturally and Primary Reflexes - Restore energy with organic moves,,[],"'Healing Naturally and Primary Reflexes' will provide you with insight into the probable cause of your constant lack of energy and will give you practical tools to regain your vitality in a 100% natural way. You may never have heard about primary reflexes, or primitive reflexes, but they can be the source of many health problems.The book highlights the devastating influence primary reflexes can have on the human body from the age of 12 months onwards. Knowing about these reflexes, you will be able to find a solution in the form of primary reflex inhibition by which these reflexes are controlled and hence stop the energy drain and stress. Knowledge of uninhibited primary reflexes is scarce. Therefore you may not be aware of the disturbing effects of these repetitive movements on your nervous system.All of us, regardless of our origin, education or culture, can suffer from uninhibited primary reflexes.In the womb, babies develop primary reflexes or movement patterns that help them to survive the birthing process and the following couple of months. They enable essential functions like breathing, feeding and reacting to stimuli. However necessary these reflexes may be at the start of our lives, a baby needs to learn to control them. In the majority of cases this happens naturally, but not always. It is generally unknown that these primary reflexes can linger on uninhibited, resulting in chronic stress.This stress can come in a variety of disguises. Symptoms may vary, ranging from inflammation, muscle and bone pain to motoric and postural problems; from emotional instability to psychiatric disorders; from concentration issues and dizzy spells to food and metabolism problems; from learning difficulties to autistic symptoms; and from all sorts of difficulties surrounding pregnancy, giving birth and feeding to relational and social problems.This book sheds light on a phenomenon about which little is known.RPRM®, Remembering Primary Reflexes, presents a fast method to regain your vitality by inhibiting these reflexes and releasing related stress. You will be guided through the natural process of primary reflex movements by a therapist who has successfully applied this method to many patients. Simply by remembering primary reflex movements you can help yourself heal. There is no need for pills. Parents will find RPRM to be a friendly way to help their children without harmful side effects and therapists who take the RPRM® training will have a very powerful tool to help their clients. The book contains a practical list of symptoms and their relation to uninhibited primary reflexes.",,,02/28/11,September 22nd 2016,[],Kindle Edition,,B01LZK89WE,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474568369l/32182433._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,4.0,120,Amsterdam Publishers,[],,[],,['Margaret Mulder']

Healthcare Kaizen: Engaging Front-Line Staff in Sustainable Continuous Improvements,,[],"Healthcare Kaizen focuses on the principles and methods of daily continuous improvement, or Kaizen, for healthcare professionals and organizations. Kaizen is a Japanese word that means ""change for the better,"" as popularized by Masaaki Imai in his 1986 book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success and through the books of Norman Bodek, both of whom contributed introductory material for this book.Winner of a 2013 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award!In 1989, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, endorsed the principles of Kaizen in the New England Journal of Medicine, describing it as ""the continuous search for opportunities for all processes to get better."" This book shows how to make this goal a reality.Healthcare Kaizen shares some of the methods used by numerous hospitals around the world, including Franciscan St. Francis Health, where co-author Joe Swartz has led these efforts. Most importantly, the book covers the management mindsets and philosophies required to make Kaizen work effectively in a hospital department or as an organization-wide program. All of the examples in the book were shared by leading healthcare organizations, with over 200 full-color pictures and visual illustrations of Kaizen-based improvements that were initiated by nurses, physicians, housekeepers, senior executives and other staff members at all levels.Healthcare Kaizen will be helpful for organizations that have embraced weeklong improvement events, but now want to follow the lead of ThedaCare, Virginia Mason Medical Center, and others who have moved beyond just doing events into a more complete management system based on Lean or the Toyota Production System. It's often said, without much reflection, that people hate change. The experiences shared in this book prove that people actually love change when they are fully engaged in the process, get to make improvements that improve patient care and make their day less frustrating, and when they don't fear being laid off as a result of their improvements.Mark Graban explains why his new book Healthcare Kaizen is a great resource for healthcare organizations looking to make improvements on the frontlines.(www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4JdaH03Dbo&a...)

Havana.

Part cultural history, part travelogue, with recipes, historic engravings, photographs, and Kurlansky's own pen-and-ink drawings throughout, Havana celebrates the city's singular music, literature, baseball, and food; its five centuries of outstanding, neglected architecture; and its extraordinary blend of cultures.Like all great cities, Havana has a rich history that informs the vibrant place it is today--from the native Taino to Columbus's landing, from Cuba's status as a U.S. protectorate to Batista's dictatorship and Castro's revolution, from Soviet presence to the welcoming of capitalist tourism. Havana is a place of extremes: a beautifully restored colonial city whose cobblestone streets pass through areas that have not been painted or repaired since the revolution.Kurlansky shows Havana through the eyes of Cuban writers, such as Alejo Carpentier and José Martí, and foreigners, including Graham Greene and Hemingway. He introduces us to Cuban baseball and its highly opinionated fans; the city's music scene, alive with the rhythm of Son; its culinary legacy. Once the only country Americans couldn't visit, Cuba is now opening to us, as is Havana, not only by plane or boat but also through Mark Kurlansky's multilayered and electrifying portrait of the long-elusive city.",,1,03/07/17,2018,[],Hardcover,,9786094662898,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517160199l/38225330.jpg,3.91,[],90.0,1.0,,,,97.0,1017.0,224,Tyto alba,"['236', '486', '265', '29', '1']",,[],,['Mark Kurlansky']

Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",,,,March 7th 2000,"['Zampanò', 'Will Navidson', 'Karen Green', 'Johnny Truant']",Paperback,,9780385603102,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403889034l/24800.jpg,4.06,"['Bram Stoker Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2000)', 'Locus Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2001)', 'New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Award (2001)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2000)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (2000)', 'International Horror Guild Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2000)', 'Premio Ignotus Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera (Best Foreign Novel) (2014)']",8420.0,94.0,,,,89.0,131060.0,705,Random House,"['61156', '36282', '19289', '8446', '5887']",,[],,['Mark Z.

Haymarket,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Politics', 'American']","On the night of May 4, 1886, during a peaceful demonstration of labor activists in Haymarket Square in Chicago, a dynamite bomb was thrown into the ranks of police -trying to disperse the crowd. The officers immediately opened fire, killing a number of protestors and wounding some two hundred others. Albert Parsons was the best-known of those hanged; Haymarket is his story. Parsons, humanist and autodidact, was an ex-Confederate soldier who grew up in Texas in the 1870s, and fell in love with Lucy Gonzalez, a vibrant, outspoken black woman who preferred to describe herself as of Spanish and Creole descent. The novel tells the story of their lives together, of their growing political involvement, of the formation of a colorful circle of ""co-conspirators""-immigrants, radical intellectuals, journalists, advocates of the working class-and of the events culminating in bloodshed. More than just a moving story of love and human struggle, more than a faithful account of a watershed event in United States history, Haymarket presents a layered and dynamic revelation of late nineteenth-century Chicago, and of the lives of a handful of remarkable individuals who were willing to risk their lives for the promise of social change.",,,February 1st 2003,February 3rd 2004,[],Hardcover,,9781583226186,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320484828l/1607657.jpg,3.66,[],9.0,1.0,,,,91.0,107.0,336,Seven Stories Press,"['19', '44', '34', '9', '1']",,[],,['Martin Duberman']

Dowd starts to introduce his imaginary friend Harvey, a six and a half foot rabbit, to guests at a dinner party, his sister, Veta, has seen as much of his eccentric behavior as she can tolerate. She decides to have him committed to a sanitarium to spare her daughter, Myrtle Mae, and their family, from future embarrassment. Problems arise, however, when Veta herself is mistakenly assumed to be on the fringe of lunacy when she explains to doctors that years of living with Elwood's hallucination have caused her to see Harvey also!

For countless adolescents across America who came of age in the early 1970s, Marcia was the ideal American teenager. Girls wanted to be her. Boys wanted to date her. But what viewers didn't know about the always-sunny, perfect Marcia was that offscreen, her real-life counterpart, Maureen McCormick, the young actress who portrayed her, was living a very different—and not-so-wonderful—life. Now, for the very first time, Maureen tells the shocking and inspirational true story of the beloved teen generations have invited into their living rooms—and the woman she became.In Here's the Story, Maureen takes us behind the scenes of America's favorite television family, the Bradys. With poignancy and candor, she reveals the lifelong friendships, the hurtful jealousies, the offscreen romance, the loving support her television family provided during a life-or-death moment, and the inconsolable loss of a man who had been a second father. But The Brady Bunch was only the beginning. Haunted by the perfection of her television alter ego, Maureen landed on the dark side, caught up in a fast-paced, drug-fueled, star-studded Hollywood existence that ultimately led to the biggest battle of her life.Moving from drug dens on Wonderland Avenue to wild parties at the Playboy mansion and exotic escapades on the beaches of Hawaii, this candid, hard-hitting memoir exposes a side of a beloved pop-culture icon the paparazzi missed. Yet it is also a story of remarkable success. After kicking her drug habit, Maureen battled depression, reconnected with her mother, whom she nursed through the end of her life, and then found herself in a pitched battle for her family in which she ultimately triumphed.There is no question: Maureen McCormick is a survivor.

After Scotland’s three most powerful clans come together to build a formidable alliance, an apprehensive king conspires to keep his empire from collapsing. He orders Taliesan McHugh to agree to a marriage that will ensure the king maintains control of the coveted McHugh fortress. With no other choice but to obey her king, Taliesan accepts her destiny. But when her path crosses with that of Brodie Armstrong, she begins to wonder what it would be like to feel the warrior’s strong arms around her—and to be loved by him. Staunchly opposing the king’s command to stand down, Brodie plots to save Taliesan from her arranged marriage. He is determined to make the gentle beauty his but finds himself at the mercy of a decades-old family agreement.

Hidden and Inaccessible Knowledge,,[],"
  Kirkus Discoveries Review
 A well-intentioned but meandering discussion of God's sublimity that frequently sinks into invective on the evils of organized religion.  Luyinduladio's central claims about enlightened religious inquiry are admirable-they should be articulated and written about more often. The author argues that we should access our religious urges through our rational capacities. He further suggests that God is too great to be confined by any one religious tradition or sacred text-or even, really, by language. This is where the movement religious scholars call negative theology begins-with the suggestion that any God we can imagine would necessarily be too sublime, too inexplicable to be conceived. (God is in some ways the ""hidden and inaccessible knowledge"" of Luyinduladio's title.) However, even the great negative theologians were ultimately stymied in their efforts to explain religious experience on their own terms. Meister Eckhart lapsed into mysticism, and Saint John of the Cross into gorgeous but obscure poetry. Luyinduladio has similar problems, but without the genius of an Eckhart or John of the Cross, he falls too often into wandering rants. Some are expected-the author abhors bigotry, religiously motivated violence, sectarian arrogance and the ignorance of the zealot. Others, however, come straight from left field. He castigates the second Bush administration for sending the United States to war in Iraq on false evidence-and Colin Powell for abetting. Luyinduladio goes on about the evils of slavery and applauds the archbishop of Canterbury for discussing the possibility of reparations. These are valid complaints but seem hugely out ofplace in a tract on God and spirituality. Further, too many of the author's central insights come straight from the religious imagination of one of the Founding Fathers, Thomas Paine. In fact, so fond is the author of Paine that he repeatedly quotes him at long length-once for a laughable 22-page stretch. Readers may wonder if they should go straight to Paine instead.  Hidden and inaccessible indeed.",,,,June 15th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9781441541833,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347625403l/6667784.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,1.0,158,Xlibris Corporation,[],,[],,['Mbuta Luyinduladio Celly']

But it always seemed like a fleeting whim, a funny idea, something I would never actually do.”In her late twenties and after a series of unsatisfying office jobs, Melissa Plaut decided she was going to stop worrying about what to do with the rest of her life and focus on what she was going to do next. Her first adventure: becoming a taxi driver. Undeterred by the fact that 99 percent of cabbies in the city were men, she went to taxi school, got her hack license, and hit the streets of Manhattan and the outlying boroughs.Hack traces Plaut’s first two years behind the wheel of a yellow cab traveling the 6,400 miles of New York City streets. She shares the highs, the lows, the shortcuts, and professional trade secrets. Between figuring out where and when to take a bathroom break and trying to avoid run-ins with the NYPD, Plaut became an honorary member of a diverse brotherhood that included Harvey, the cross-dressing cabbie; the dispatcher affectionately called “Paul the crazy Romanian”; and Lenny, the garage owner rumored to be the real-life prototype for TV’s Louie De Palma of Taxi.With wicked wit and arresting insight, Melissa Plaut reveals the crazy parade of humanity that passed through her cab–including struggling actors, federal judges, bartenders, strippers, and drug dealers–while showing how this grueling work provided her with empowerment and a greater sense of self.

How Not to Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease,,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Nutrition', 'Food', 'Science', 'Self Help', 'Vegan', 'Diets', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine']","From the physician behind the wildly popular website NutritionFacts.org, How Not to Die reveals the groundbreaking scientific evidence behind the only diet that can prevent and reverse many of the causes of disease-related death.The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In How Not to Die, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America -- heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more -- and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, How Not to Die includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -- a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.",,,,December 8th 2015,[],Hardcover,,9781250066114,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436292289l/25663961._SY475_.jpg,4.5,[],90.0,1.0,,,,98.0,22295.0,576,Flatiron Books,"['14301', '5655', '1791', '381', '167']",,[],,"['Michael Greger', 'Gene Stone']"

The craniums in our part of the country were designed to leave a little extra room for the brain to grow in case one day we found ourselves exposed to something we didn't understand, like a foreign language, or a salad."" Michael Moore-Oscar-winning filmmaker, bestselling author, the nation's unofficial provocateur laureate-is back, this time taking on an entirely new role, that of his own meta-Forest Gump. Breaking the autobiographical mode, he presents twenty-four far-ranging, irreverent, and stranger-than-fiction vignettes from his own early life. One moment he's an eleven-year-old boy lost in the Senate and found by Bobby Kennedy; and in the next, he's inside the Bitburg cemetery with a dazed and confused Ronald Reagan. Fast-forwarding to 2003, he stuns the world by uttering the words ""We live in fictitious times . . . with a fictitious president"" in place of the expected ""I'd like to thank the Academy.""  And none of that even comes close to the night the friendly priest at the seminary decides to show him how to perform his own exorcism.  Capturing the zeitgeist of the past fifty years, yet deeply personal and unflinchingly honest, Here Comes Trouble takes readers on an unforgettable, take-no-prisoners ride through the life and times of Michael Moore.

One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousnessWhen LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs.

But his firepower is nothing compared to the heat Michael faces in his day-to-day life. Newly orphaned after his father led the family's escape from Cuba, Michael's only family is his seventeen-yearold brother Carlos. If Social Services hears of their situation, they will be separated in the foster-care system--or worse, sent back to Cuba. Together, the boys carry on alone, dodging bills and anyone who asks too many questions. But then someone wonders how a twelve-year-old boy could possibly throw with as much power as Michael Arroyo throws.

How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military History', 'British Literature', 'Africa', '19th Century', 'Military Fiction']","Wednesday 22 January 1879 was one of the most dramatic days in the long and distinguished history of the British Army. At noon a massive Zulu host attacked the 24th Regiment in its encampment at the foot of the mountain of Isandlwana, a distinctive feature that bore an eerie resemblance to the Sphinx badge of the outnumbered redcoats. Disaster ensued. Later that afternoon the victorious Zulus would strike the tiny British garrison at Rorke's Drift. How Can Man Die Better is a unique analysis of Isandlwana v of the weapons, tactics, ground, and the intriguing characters who made the key military decisions. Because the fatal loss was so high on the British side there is still much that is unknown about the battle v until now. Mike Snook is the first military professional to scrutinize the battle in print since 1879. He has an unparalleled grasp of the nuances of the ground at Isandlwana and of their implications in practical military terms. Most compellingly he has an instinctive feel for the characters who forged this supremely dramatic history, for this is µfamily' history v the battle was fought by soldiers of the author's own regiment. This is a work of unparalleled depth, which eschews the commonly held perception that the British collapse was sudden and that the 24th Regiment was quickly overwhelmed. Rather, there was a protracted and heroic defence against a determined and equally heroic foe. The author reconstructs the final phase of the battle in a way that has never been attempted before. It was to become the stuff of legend, which the author brings to life so vividly that one can almost sense the fear and smell the blood. How Can Man Die Better is essential reading for anyone interested in Isandlwana, the wider Anglo-Zulu War or the Victorian Army.",,,,March 17th 2006,[],Hardcover,,9781853676567,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328842836l/739589.jpg,4.43,[],53.0,1.0,,,,98.0,230.0,320,Greenhill Books,"['125', '83', '18', '3', '1']",,[],,['Mike Snook']

"History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3",From Muhammad to the Age of Reforms,Religion,"This volume completes the immensely learned three-volume A History of Religious Ideas. Eliade examines the movement of Jewish thought out of ancient Eurasia, the Christian transformation of the Mediterranean area and Europe, and the rise and diffusion of Islam from approximately the sixth through the seventeenth centuries. Eliade's vast knowledge of past and present scholarship provides a synthesis that is unparalleled. In addition to reviewing recent interpretations of the individual traditions, he explores the interactions of the three religions and shows their continuing mutual influence to be subtle but unmistakable. As in his previous work, Eliade pays particular attention to heresies, folk beliefs, and cults of secret wisdom, such as alchemy and sorcery, and continues the discussion, begun in earlier volumes, of pre-Christian shamanistic practices in northern Europe and the syncretistic tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. These subcultures, he maintains, are as important as the better-known orthodoxies to a full understanding of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.",,,,1988.0,,,0226204057,9780226204055,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rB6jwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.43,,,,,,,,,367.0,,,406.0,,,['Mircea Eliade']

Have a Little Faith: a True Story,,"['Nonfiction', 'Inspirational', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Memoir', 'Faith', 'Biography', 'Christian', 'Adult', 'Contemporary']","In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere.Albom's first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.Have a Little Faith is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.

Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic,,"['Jewish', 'Judaism', 'Judaica', 'Religion']","“Idel’s book has broken new ground in the study of the mystical Judaism of Eastern Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By applying what he calls the panoramic approach, in contrast to the existentialist approach of Buber and the historicist approach of Scholem, Idel has been able to illuminate the phenomenon of Hasidism in all its complexity and diversity. Rather than focusing on any one immediate aspect of Jewish mysticism, Idel proposes to understand Hasidism as the aggregation of multiple streams, including magic, theosophic kabbalah, and ecstatic kabbalah. By applying Idel’s orientation one can appreciate the complex fabric woven by the Hasidic masters from previous mystical sources. His book is provocative and stimulating.” ― Elliot R. Wolfson, New York University“The author succeeds in broadening our understanding of Hasidism through clarifying its relations to phenomenological models that are typical of earlier stages of Jewish mysticism. As a result of Idel’s vast knowledge of mystical and philosophical literature, he is able to demonstrate and clarify the extent that Hasidism is dependent on non-Lurianic schools of Kabbalah. Thus, Hasidism emerges as an important stage in Jewish mysticism, rather than as a mere reaction or result of historical and social forces such as Sabbatianism.""Idel focuses on one of the most significant, yet little understood developments in the history of Jewish thought and religion. His close study of ecstasy and magic will be essential for all those who are in any way interested in this area.“The book is full of brilliant insights concerning the meaning of key concepts and practices in early Hasidism."" ― Miles Krassen, Oberlin College",,,,January 17th 1995,[],Paperback,,9780791417348,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390251408l/252460.jpg,4.15,[],97.0,1.0,,,,100.0,27.0,448,State University of New York Press,"['10', '11', '6', '0', '0']",,[],,['Moshe Idel']

Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide,,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Social Justice', 'Womens', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Africa', 'Gender', 'Education', 'Social Issues']","From two of our most fiercely moral voices, a passionate call to arms against our era’s most pervasive human rights violation: the oppression of women and girls in the developing world.With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women’s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it’s also the best strategy for fighting poverty.Deeply felt, pragmatic, and inspirational, Half the Sky is essential reading for every global citizen.",,,09/08/08,September 8th 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780307267146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320486170l/6260997.jpg,4.29,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Current Interest (2009)'],664.0,8.0,,,,96.0,51110.0,294,Knopf Publishing Group,"['26397', '15987', '6458', '1545', '723']",,[],,"['Nicholas D.

Baker reminds us, for instance, not to forget that it was thanks in great part to Churchill and England that Mussolini ascended to power so quickly, and that, before leading the United States against Nazi Germany, a young FDR spent much of his time lobbying for a restriction in the number of Jews admitted to Harvard. Conversely, Human Smokealsoreminds us of those who had the foresight to anticipate the coming bloodshed and the courage to oppose the tide of history, as Gandhi demonstrated when he made his symbolic walk to the ocean -- for which he was immediately imprisoned by the British.Praised by critics and readers alike for his gifted writing and exquisitely observant eye, Baker offers a combination of sweeping narrative history and a series of finely delineated vignettes of the individuals and moments that shaped history that is guaranteed to spark new dialogue on the subject.",,,11/06/08,March 11th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9781416567844,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366341105l/1948985.jpg,3.99,"['J.

In barely six years, a small group of young, ambitious programmers in Silicon Valley built an $11.5 billion business out of the ashes of a failed podcasting company. Today Twitter boasts more than 200 million active users and has affected business, politics, media, and other fields in innumerable ways. Now Nick Bilton of the New York Times takes readers behind the scenes with a narrative that shows what happened inside Twitter as it grew at exponential speeds. This is a tale of betrayed friendships and high-stakes power struggles as the four founders—Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Jack Dorsey, and Noah Glass—went from everyday engineers to wealthy celebrities, featured on magazine covers, Oprah, The Daily Show, and Time’s list of the world’s most influential people. Bilton’s exclusive access and exhaustive investigative reporting—drawing on hundreds of sources, documents, and internal e-mails—have enabled him to write an intimate portrait of fame, influence, and power.

How to Be Good,,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Adult', 'Comedy', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction']","In Nick Hornby's How to Be Good, Katie Carr is certainly trying to be. That's why she became a GP. That's why she cares about Third World debt and homelessness, and struggles to raise her children with a conscience. It's also why she puts up with her husband David, the self-styled Angriest Man in Holloway. But one fateful day, she finds herself in a Leeds parking lot, having just slept with another man. What Katie doesn't yet realize is that her fall from grace is just the first step on a spiritual journey more torturous than the interstate at rush hour. Because, prompted by his wife's actions, David is about to stop being angry. He's about to become good--not politically correct, organic-food-eating good, but good in the fashion of the Gospels. And that's no easier in modern-day Holloway than it was in ancient Israel.  Hornby means us to take his title literally: How can we be good, and what does that mean? However, quite apart from demanding that his readers scrub their souls with the nearest available Brillo pad, he also mesmerizes us with that cocktail of wit and compassion that has become his trademark. The result is a multifaceted jewel of a book: a hilarious romp, a painstaking dissection of middle-class mores, and a powerfully sympathetic portrait of a marriage in its death throes. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as we watch David forcing his kids to give away their computers, drawing up schemes for the mass redistribution of wealth, and inviting his wife's most desolate patients round for a Sunday roast. But that's because How to Be Good manages to be both brutally truthful and full of hope. It won't outsell the Bible, but it's a lot funnier. --Matthew BaylisFrom Publishers WeeklyKate, a doctor, wife and mother, is in the midst of a difficult decision: whether to leave or stay with her bitter, sarcastic husband David (who proudly writes a local newspaper column called ""The Angriest Man in Holloway""). The long-term marriage has gone stale, but is it worth uprooting the children and the comfortable lifestyle? Then David meets a faith healer called Dr. Goodnews, and suddenly converts to an idealistic do-gooder: donating the children's computer to an orphanage, giving away the family's Sunday dinner to homeless people and inviting runaways to stay in the guest room (and convincing the neighbors to do likewise). Barber gives an outstanding performance as Kate, humorously conveying her mounting irritation at having her money and belongings donated to strangers, her guilt at not feeling more generous and her hilarious desire for revenge. Barber brilliantly portrays each eccentric character: hippie-ish Goodnews, crusading David, petulant children and, poignantly, the hesitant, halting Barmy Brian, a mentally deficient patient of Kate's who needs looking after. Barber's stellar performance turns a worthy novel into a must-listen event.

In seventh-century Britain, small kingdoms are merging, usually violently. A new religion is coming ashore; the old gods’ priests are worrying. Edwin of Northumbria plots to become overking of the Angles, ruthlessly using every tool at his disposal: blood, bribery, belief.Hild is the king’s youngest niece. She has the powerful curiosity of a bright child, a will of adamant, and a way of seeing the world—of studying nature, of matching cause with effect, of observing human nature and predicting what will happen next—that can seem uncanny, even supernatural, to those around her. She establishes herself as the king’s seer. And she is indispensable—until she should ever lead the king astray.

Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience.

Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.Eyal provides readers with:• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.• Actionable steps for building products people love.• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.",,,12/25/13,November 4th 2014,[],Hardcover,,9781591847786,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407112405l/22668729.jpg,4.09,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Business Books (2014)'],98.0,1.0,,,,95.0,26110.0,256,Portfolio,"['10221', '9744', '4759', '1019', '367']",,[],,['Nir Eyal']

World-renowned intellectual Noam Chomsky investigates how we came to this perilous moment and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species.With the striking logic that is his trademark, Chomsky tracks the U.S. government's aggressive pursuit of ""full spectrum dominance"" and vividly lays out how the most recent manifestations of the politics of global control-from unilateralism to the dismantling of international agreements to state terrorism-cohere in a drive for hegemony that ultimately threatens our existence.

Honor and Polygamy,,"['Fiction', 'Polygamy']","Heartbreaking and timely novel by Afghan-American author follows one man's journey from New York to the clutches of the Taliban and into an unintentional polygamist union. ""He is picking up the same bags with the same clothes Lisa packed and folded a year ago. He wishes he were like his clothes, untouched by external forces."" Family man Nick Blake is living in New York City and working for the United Nations. Born and raised in the United States with broad knowledge of the Afghan culture, he is living the All-American life with his wife, Lisa, and their children. His life is turned upside down when, while on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan, Nick is kidnapped and finds himself in the clutches of the Taliban. Omar Farhad's debut novel Honor and Polygamy follows Nick throughout his eighteen months in Afghanistan and the devastating and unexpected turns his life takes, as he learns the true meanings of home, history and culture. After being held captive for several months, Nick is forced to marry the sixteen-year-old Shaista. Although he cannot forget his beloved wife and children back home, he finds himself falling in love with his second wife and, overwhelmed with guilt, is torn between his old life and his new one. Honor and Polygamy is far from simply a captivating fiction story, but is also a brilliant commentary on the United States' situation with Afghanistan. Farhad expresses his views on both the political and the cultural sides of Afghanistan. Politically, he is predicting how he feels the war will ultimately end, while culturally, he shows readers not familiar with Afghanistan that the 35-year-old war has created a population, which is uneducated, disloyal, and without identity. The United States and many other nations have continuously disrupted Afghanistan with no clear political objectives, and, in his novel, Farhad explores the consequences of these actions. The story of Nick Blake represents the reality of the Afghan culture and the results and disappointments of the political realities in Afghanistan, and shows readers just how unaware we all are of other cultures. Written by an author who has lived both the American and Afghan ways of life, Honor and Polygamy is a harrowing, haunting and deeply moving tale for our times.",,,05/28/14,May 7th 2014,[],Paperback,,9781491732953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400872547l/22242097.jpg,4.24,[],4071.0,43.0,,,,90.0,156.0,132,iUniverse,"['91', '36', '13', '8', '8']",,[],,['Omar Farhad']

Before the time of cell-phones, computers and television, family members would gather on the front porch and offer up stories through simple oral traditions. These stories were to provide simple forms of entertainment to their children. With each generation, the stories become more elaborate and creative. These yarns became known as Appalachian folklore. Mountain people have always led a difficult life; but how they dealt with their struggles is a unique perspective on Appalachian people.Also, in this book you will find a small section on mountain medicinal treatments and hillbilly proverbs, which were carried over from mother to daughter down the family line. Knowledge of apothecary, or also known as mountain medicine, was necessary to treat family members who became ill while the local doctor was away visiting two towns over.

Wise sayings or hillbilly proverbs go hand-in-hand with mountain medicine and is given to anyone who might need guidance in their daily life.The second part of the book includes a special story written by one of the original descendants of the Crowe Family, Ms. Verna Humphrey.

Herzog on Herzog,Conversations with Paul Cronin,Performing Arts,"An invaluable set of career-length interviews with the German genius hailed by François Truffaut as ""the most important film director alive"" Most of what we've heard about Werner Herzog is untrue. The sheer number of false rumors and downright lies disseminated about the man and his films is truly astonishing. Yet Herzog's body of work is one of the most important in postwar European cinema. His international breakthrough came in 1973 with Aguirre, The Wrath of God, in which Klaus Kinski played a crazed Conquistador. For The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Herzog cast in the lead a man who had spent most of his life institutionalized, and two years later he hypnotized his entire cast to make Heart of Glass. He rushed to an explosive volcanic Caribbean island to film La Soufrière, paid homage to F. W. Murnau in a terrifying remake of Nosferatu, and in 1982 dragged a boat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle for Fitzcarraldo. More recently, Herzog has made extraordinary ""documentary"" films such as Little Dieter Needs to Fly. His place in cinema history is assured, and Paul Cronin's volume of dialogues provides a forum for Herzog's fascinating views on the things, ideas, and people that have preoccupied him for so many years.",,,,2003.0,,,0571207081,9780571207084,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kRzxwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.44,,,,,,,,,352.0,,,1344.0,,,['Paul Cronin']

Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age,,"['Nonfiction', 'Programming', 'Business', 'Technology', 'Computer Science', 'Computers', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Science', 'Software']","“The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you’re willing to risk the consequences.” —from Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul GrahamWe are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls “an intellectual Wild West.”The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.",,,05/20/04,May 25th 2004,[],Hardcover,,9780596006624,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348562702l/41793.jpg,4.06,[],100.0,1.0,,,,92.0,8090.0,272,O'Reilly Media,"['3256', '2811', '1412', '438', '173']",,[],,"['Paul Graham', 'Allen Noren', 'Matt Hutchinson']"
"Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961",,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Collections', 'Books About Books', 'Literature', 'Unfinished', 'Memoir', 'Writing']","From a National Book Critics Circle Award winner, a brilliantly conceived and illuminating reconsideration of a key period in the life of Ernest Hemingway that will forever change the way he is perceived and understood.Focusing on the years 1934 to 1961—from Hemingway’s pinnacle as the reigning monarch of American letters until his suicide—Paul Hendrickson traces the writer’s exultations and despair around the one constant in his life during this time: his beloved boat, Pilar.We follow him from Key West to Paris, to New York, Africa, Cuba, and finally Idaho, as he wrestles with his best angels and worst demons. Whenever he could, he returned to his beloved fishing cruiser, to exult in the sea, to fight the biggest fish he could find, to drink, to entertain celebrities and friends and seduce women, to be with his children. But as he began to succumb to the diseases of fame, we see that Pilar was also where he cursed his critics, saw marriages and friendships dissolve, and tried, in vain, to escape his increasingly diminished capacities.Generally thought of as a great writer and an unappealing human being, Hemingway emerges here in a far more benevolent light. Drawing on previously unpublished material, including interviews with Hemingway’s sons, Hendrickson shows that for all the writer’s boorishness, depression, and alcoholism, and despite his choleric anger, he was capable of remarkable generosity—to struggling writers, to lost souls, to the dying son of a friend.We see most poignantly his relationship with his youngest son, Gigi, a doctor who lived his adult life mostly as a cross-dresser, and died squalidly and alone in a Miami women’s jail. He was the son Hemingway forsook the least, yet the one who disappointed him the most, as Gigi acted out for nearly his whole life so many of the tortured, ambiguous tensions his father felt. Hendrickson’s bold and beautiful book strikingly makes the case that both men were braver than we know, struggling all their lives against the complicated, powerful emotions swirling around them. As Hendrickson writes, “Amid so much ruin, still the beauty.”Hemingway’s Boat is both stunningly original and deeply gripping, an invaluable contribution to our understanding of this great American writer, published fifty years after his death.",,,,September 20th 2011,['Ernest Hemingway'],Hardcover,,9781400041626,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347588630l/10497786.jpg,3.73,"['Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction (2012)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography (2011)']",92.0,1.0,,,,88.0,1819.0,534,Alfred A.

How to Make Gravy,,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Australia', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']","This extraordinary book has its genesis in a series of concerts first staged in 2004. Over four nights Paul Kelly performed, in alphabetical order, one hundred of his songs from the previous three decades. In between songs he told stories about them, and from those little tales grew How to Make Gravy, a memoir like no other. Each of its hundred chapters, also in alphabetical order by song title, consists of lyrics followed by a story, the nature of the latter taking its cue from the former. Some pieces are confessional, some tell Kelly's personal and family history, some take you on a road tour with the band, some form an idiosyncratic history of popular music, some are like small essays, some stand as a kind of how-to of the songwriter's art – from the point of inspiration to writing, honing, collaborating, performing, recording and reworking.Paul Kelly is a born storyteller. Give him two verses with a chorus or 550 pages, but he won't waste a word. How to Make Gravy is a long volume that's as tight as a three-piece band. There isn't a topic this man can't turn his pen to – contemporary music and the people who play it, football, cricket, literature, opera, social issues, love, loss, poetry, the land and the history of Australia … there are even quizzes. The writing is insightful, funny, honest, compassionate, intelligent, playful, erudite, warm, thought-provoking. Paul Kelly is a star with zero pretensions, an everyman who is also a renaissance man. He thinks and loves and travels and reads widely, and his musical memoir is destined to become a classic – it doesn't have a bum note on it.",,,09/22/10,October 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,,9781926428222,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348810351l/9364112.jpg,4.3,"[""Prime Minister's Literary Awards Nominee for Nonfiction (2011)"", 'Australian Independent Booksellers Indie Book Award Nominee for Non-Fiction (2011)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for Biography (2011)']",99.0,1.0,,,,96.0,627.0,576,Penguin Books Australia,"['313', '215', '77', '16', '6']",,[],,['Paul Kelly']

Healing With Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition,,"['Health', 'Nutrition', 'Food', 'Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Cookbooks', 'Cooking', 'Traditional Chinese Medicine', 'Self Help', 'Medicine']","Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, this is a hefty, truly comprehensive guide to the theory and healing power of Chinese medicine. It's also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen). There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out.",,Third Edition,10/30/93,November 5th 2002,[],Paperback,,9781556434303,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388191502l/10464.jpg,4.41,[],97.0,1.0,,,,97.0,3097.0,784,North Atlantic Books,"['1822', '842', '336', '69', '28']",,[],,['Paul Pitchford']

Jobless and ashamed, he takes them into a stranger’s house, a place that will become the site of the greatest humiliation of his life. In an impoverished fishing town, four teenage boys try to allay their boredom during an endless summer by translating lyrics from the Smiths into Spanish using a stolen dictionary. Their dreams of fame and glory twist into a plan to steal musical instruments from a church, an obsession that prevents one of them from anticipating a devastating ending. Meanwhile a young woman goes home with a charismatic man after finding his daughter wandering lost in a public place. She soon discovers, like so many characters in this book, that fortuitous encounters can be deceptions in disguise.Themes of pride, shame, and disgrace—small and large, personal and public—tie the stories in this collection together.

How To Start a Business From Home,,[],"How to Start a Business is a conversational step-by-step guide to starting a small business. Inside you'll discover how to choose a business that's right for you, how to name your business, legal setup, leases, employees and more. The author Perry Belcher has started, ran and sold dozens of businesses and shares his experiences, mistakes and biggest breakthroughs.Does starting a business with a small amount of money sound too good to be true? No! There are many home based entrepreneurs who have successfully started their own businesses with little money. We’ve interviewed entrepreneurs who bootstrapped their businesses for as low as $500, yet they are now raking in money from their businesses. The lesson? Do things right! Of course, the ideal scenario is to start a business with enough money to enable you to move more aggressively and expand your business faster. But even if you do not have money, that should not prevent you from starting your own business. If you have great idea and a viable business plan, you can use Other People’s Money (OPM) to start your business. Or if you do not have access to OPM, you better learn how to tighten your belt and bootstrap your fledging business. Remember, while you may not be spending money, you still have to pay with something ­ your time and energy.Below are 10 areas Perry covers in his book:1. Think twice before borrowing. It would be ideal if you will not have to borrow money to start your business. After all, you want your own business to give you an additional source of income, if not the main paycheck. You do not need another bill to pay.But sometimes, you really have to borrow money to keep going. A major reason why many small businesses fail is inadequate capital. If you really have to, you must be prepared to take on the right kind of debt. Not all debt is bad debt. You have to ensure that before taking on a debt, you must see a way to pay it back through your business. As much as you want to be optimistic about your venture, there is always the possibility that your business can fail. Instead of fattening up your bank account, you could end up selling your house, your car and withdrawing your children’s college tuition just to pay off the debts. Be a smart risk taker.2. Be lean and mean. If you have limited capital, set aside any thoughts of a fancy store or great office. Start home-based and explore the advantages of working at home. Or if you must be “out there” selling your products, rent a small section at a flea market or fair. You may consider renting at the mall only when you see money coming in.In terms of legal structure, you can save tons of money by starting as a proprietorship. A Corporation is expensive to set-up, requires vast amounts of record-keeping, and will tax you twice ­ as an individual working for the business and as a corporation.Plus, you have to operate as tightly as possible. As a sole business owner on a budget, you do not have the luxury of wasting supplies, making unnecessary long-distance calls, and spending office money without a thought. Now every expense comes from your own pocket. Spend money only when you really have to. In fact, you can save tons of money if you select a business based on equipment that you already own. For example, consider starting a photography business if you already have your camera and photography gear. You may want to start a daycare business if you already have enough space in your house rather than spending money at the start of the business constructing new rooms in your house. If you must buy equipment, do so only when you have already landed your first account. Otherwise, consider renting it for the moment.3. Choose your business carefully.",,,,March 25th 2011,[],Kindle Edition,,B004TZ073C,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386778783l/19377346.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,2.0,79,,[],,[],,"['Perry Belcher', 'Trisha Sebastian']"

When Corbin Dell, a distant cousin in Boston, suggests the two temporarily swap apartments, Kate, an art student in London, agrees, hoping that time away in a new place will help her overcome the recent wreckage of her life.Soon after her arrival at Corbin’s grand apartment on Beacon Hill, Kate makes a shocking discovery: his next-door neighbor, a young woman named Audrey Marshall, has been murdered. When the police question her about Corbin, a shaken Kate has few answers, and many questions of her own—curiosity that intensifies when she meets Alan Cherney, a handsome, quiet tenant who lives across the courtyard, in the apartment facing Audrey’s. Alan saw Corbin surreptitiously come and go from Audrey’s place, yet he’s denied knowing her. Then, Kate runs into a tearful man claiming to be the dead woman’s old boyfriend, who insists Corbin did the deed the night that he left for London.When she reaches out to her cousin, he proclaims his innocence and calms her nerves--until she comes across disturbing objects hidden in the apartment and accidentally learns that Corbin is not where he says he is. Could Corbin be a killer? What about Alan? Kate finds herself drawn to this appealing man who seems so sincere, yet she isn’t sure.

According to award-winning writer and scholar of religions Reza Aslan, by infusing the United States War on Terror with the same kind of religiously polarizing rhetoric and Manichean worldview, is also fighting a cosmic war-a war that can't be won. How to Win a Cosmic War""""is both an in-depth study of the ideology fueling al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and like-minded militants throughout the Muslim world, and an exploration of religious violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Surveying the global scene from Israel to Iraq and from New York to the Netherlands, Aslan argues that religion is a stronger force today than it has been in a century. At a time when religion and politics are increasingly sharing the same vocabulary and functioning in the same sphere, Aslan writes that we must strip the conflicts of our world-in particular, the War on Terror-of their religious connotations and address the earthly grievances that always lie behind the cosmic impulse.

Musicians were encouraged to do whatever the hell they wanted and damn the consequences. From humble beginnings, some of our most influential artists were allowed to thrive: Orange Juice, New Order, Cocteau Twins, Depeche Mode, Happy Mondays, The Smiths, Sonic Youth, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Teenage Fanclub, Broadcast, The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, and Arctic Monkeys, to name but a handful.

Looking back on the hardships of his early life, where difficult days are faced with courage but the valleys swell with the sound of Welsh voices, it becomes clear that there is nowhere so green as the landscape of his own memory. An immediate bestseller on publication in 1939, How Green Was My Valley quickly became one of the best-loved novels of the twentieth century. Poetic and nostalgic, it is an elegy to a lost world.Richard Dafydd Vivian Llewellyn Lloyd (1906-1983), better known by his pen name Richard Llewellyn, claimed to have been born in St David's, Pembrokeshire, Wales; after his death he was discovered to have been born of Welsh parents in Hendon, Middlesex. His famous first novel How Green Was My Valley (1939) was begun in St David's from a draft he had written in India, and was later adapted into an Oscar-winning film by director John Ford. None But the Lonely Heart, his second novel, was published in 1943, and subsequently made into a film starring Cary Grant and Ethel Barrymore. As well as novels including Green, Green My Valley Now (1975) and I Stand on a Quiet Shore (1982), Llewellyn wrote two highly successful plays, Poison Pen and NooseIf you enjoyed How Green Was My Valley, you might like Barry Hines' A Kestrel for a Knave, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'Vivid, eloquent, poetical, glowing with an inner flame of emotion'The Times Literary Supplement",,,10/28/39,June 28th 2001,['Huw Morgan'],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440708862l/40496._SY475_.jpg,4.18,['National Book Award for Fiction (1940)'],8211.0,119.0,,,,95.0,14656.0,448,Penguin Classics,"['6518', '5113', '2328', '517', '180']",,['Wales'],,['Richard Llewellyn']

As a young man, Grossman joined the socialist movement and participated in Jewish workers' strikes and demonstrations, as well as in boycotts against employers and the Austro-Hungarian state. He moved to Vienna, but was driven back to Poland by the Austrian state's racist citizenship policies. A member of the illegal Polish Communist Party, Grossman was frequently arrested and jailed, finally leaving Poland for a post at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main, which gave rise to the famous 'Frankfurt School'. Grossman published his best known work in Frankfurt, including studies of Marx's method in Capital and theories of economic crisis that remain influential today.

Heaven Is a Playground,,"['Sports', 'Basketball', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Memoir']","Heaven Is a Playground was the first book on the uniquely American phenomenon of urban basketball. Rick Telander, a young photojournalist and former high school basketball player, spent part of the summer of 1973 and all of the summer of 1974 in Brooklyn living the playground life with his subjects at Foster Park in Flatbush. He slept on the floor of a park regular’s apartment, observing, questioning, traveling and playing with, and eventually coaching a ragtag group of local teenagers whose hopes of better lives were often fanatically attached to the transcendent game itself.At times little separates the author and his subjects, both of whom are emotionally linked by their passion for hoops. But as the summer unfolds and even superstars such as the legendary and incendiary Fly Williams are confronted with the realities of ghetto life and the sociological hurdles facing African American males, the joy of the game starts to be seen as the wispy pipe dream it often becomes. Written before cell phones, disposable cameras, and cable TV, Heaven Is a Playground is one of a kind—a funny, sad, ultimately inspiring book about Americans and the roots of the sport that they love.

Sawyer introduced a character readers will never forget: Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist from a parallel Earth who was whisked from his reality into ours by a quantum-computing experiment gone awry - making him the ultimate stranger in a strange land.In that book and in its sequel, Humans, Sawyer showed us the Neanderthal version of Earth in loving detail - a tour de force of world-building; a masterpiece of alternate history.Now, in Hybrids, Ponter Boddit and his Homo sapiens lover, geneticist Mary Vaughan, are torn between two worlds, struggling to find a way to make their star-crossed relationship work. Aided by banned Neanderthal technology, they plan to conceive the first hybrid child, a symbol of hope for the joining of their two versions of reality. But after an experiment shows that Mary's religious faith - something completely absent in Neanderthals - is a quirk of the neurological wiring of Homo sapiens brains, Ponter and Mary must decide whether their child should be predisposed to atheism or belief. Meanwhile, as Mary's Earth is dealing with a collapse of its planetary magnetic field, her boss, the enigmatic Jock Krieger, has turned envious eyes on the unspoiled Eden that is the Neanderthal world . . . Hybrids is filled to bursting with Sawyer's signature speculations about alternative ways of being human, exploding our preconceptions of morality and gender, of faith and love.

Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of an American Family,,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Mental Health', 'History', 'Mental Illness', 'Memoir', 'Medical']","The heartrending story of a midcentury American family with twelve children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became science's great hope in the quest to understand the disease.Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins—aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony—and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.",,,,April 7th 2020,[],Hardcover,,9780385543767,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1569289026l/50088631._SX318_SY475_.jpg,4.16,[],292.0,3.0,,,,96.0,26566.0,400,Doubleday Books,"['10156', '11613', '3859', '646', '292']",,[],,['Robert Kolker']
Helmet for My Pillow,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'Military History', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Historical']","Now the inspiration behind the HBO series THE PACIFICHere is one of the most riveting first-person accounts to ever come out of the Second World War. Robert Leckie was 21 when he enlisted in the US Marine Corps in January 1942. In Helmet for My Pillow we follow his journey, from boot camp on Parris Island, South Carolina, all the way to the raging battles in the Pacific, where some of the war's fiercest fighting took place. Recounting his service with the 1st Marine Division and the brutal action on Guadalcanal, New Britain and Peleliu, Leckie spares no detail of the horrors and sacrifice of war, painting an unsentimental portrait of how real warriors are made, fight, and all too often die in the defence of their country.From the live-for-today rowdiness of Marines on leave to the terrors of jungle warfare against an enemy determined to fight to the last man, Leckie describes what it's really like when victory can only be measured inch by bloody inch. Unparalleled in its immediacy and accuracy, Helmet for My Pillow is a gripping account from an ordinary soldier fighting in extraordinary conditions. This is a book that brings you as close to the mud, the blood, and the experience of war as it is safe to come.Helmet for My Pillow is a grand and epic prose poem.

But just as he’s packing his bags to return to school, a creature named Dobby the house-elf announces that if Harry goes back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And it turns out, Dobby is right. Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls' bathroom; the strange behavior of Ron's little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the ""Chamber of Secrets,"" a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the Wizarding world, even affecting Harry's friend Hermione.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5),,"[""Books"",""Children's Books"",""Growing Up & Facts of Life""]","In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Lord Voldemort has returned to the Wizarding world, presenting a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop. In response to his reappearance, Dumbledore reactivates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works to defeat the Dark Lord's minions and protect his targets—especially Harry Potter. But Harry doesn’t want to be protected. Even as the Ministry of Magic denies his claims, The Daily Prophet discredits him, and even Dumbledore won’t look him in the eye, Harry grows more and more determined to fight his lifelong enemy Voldemort—if only he had the “weapon” the Order is guarding. In the meantime, he visits his godfather at his ghoulish London home, Grimmauld Place, and learns more about Voldemort’s deep reach into Wizarding history and the Wizarding world. Back at Hogwarts, Harry must deal with a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a surprising new member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team; the possibility of his first real romance; and the looming nightmare of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. He’s haunted by dreams of a heavy door at the end of a silent corridor, and a vision of his father and the young Severus Snape that changes everything he thought he knew about them. Even the joy of working with ""Dumbledore's Army"" -a group of Hogwart's students dedicated to defeating Voldemort- can't dispel the gathering darkness. Soon Harry will discover the true depth and strength of his friends; their boundless loyalty and unbearable sacrifices. His fate depends on them all.",,,,2015.0,,"[{""name"":""Kindle"",""price"":""$0.00"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Order-Phoenix-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTMXM""},{""name"":""Audiobook"",""price"":""Audiobook $0.00"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Order-Phoenix-Book/dp/B017V4NLJ4""},{""name"":""Hardcover"",""price"":""$13.69"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Order-Phoenix-Book/dp/043935806X""},{""name"":""Mass Market Paperback"",""price"":""$8.52"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Phoenix-Market-Paperback/dp/1551927500""},{""name"":""Audio CD"",""price"":""$49.83"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Order-Phoenix-Book/dp/0807220299""},{""name"":""Multimedia CD"",""price"":"""",""url"":""/Potter-Phoenix-POTTER-UNABRIDGED-Compact/dp/B00QORGNSQ""}]",0439358078,9780439358071,0439358078,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51b7R-IiOTL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",4.49,,,,,,,,,870.0,,,1996446.0,,ThriftBooks-Chicago,"['Rowling', 'J.

One day just before his eleventh birthday, an owl tries to deliver a mysterious letter—the first of a sequence of events that end in Harry meeting a giant man named Hagrid. Hagrid explains Harry's history to him: When he was a baby, the Dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, attacked and killed his parents in an attempt to kill Harry; but the only mark on Harry was a mysterious lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Now he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the headmaster is the great wizard Albus Dumbledore. Harry visits Diagon Alley to get his school supplies, especially his very own wand. To get to school, he takes the Hogwarts Express from platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station. On the train, he meets two fellow students who will become his closest friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry is assigned to Gryffindor House at Hogwarts, and soon becomes the youngest-ever Seeker on the House Quidditch team. He also studies Potions with Professor Severus Snape, who displays a deep and abiding dislike for Harry, and Defense Against the Dark Arts with nervous Professor Quirrell; he and his friends defeat a mountain troll, help Hagrid raise a dragon, and explore the wonderful, fascinating world of Hogwarts.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3),,Juvenile Fiction,"For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort, and might even have assisted in the deaths of James and Lily Potter—Harry Potter’s parents. Now Black has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard him muttering in his sleep, ""He’s at Hogwarts... he’s at Hogwarts."" Of course, Harry already had plenty to worry about. After inflating his nasty aunt and running away on the magical Knight Bus, he finds he’s being pursued by death omens at every turn. He receives two wonderful gifts: a top-of-the-line Firebolt broomstick, and the Marauder’s Map, a magical diagram of Hogwarts made by the mysterious “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.” Hermione disappears frequently, burdened down by a seemingly impossible course schedule. And the soulless Dementors have come to guard Hogwarts—supposedly to protect Harry from Sirius Black, but they terrify Harry more than the fugitive ever could. To strengthen himself against them, Harry reaches out to Remus Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was once a friend of his father’s. Lupin teaches Harry about the Patronus Charm, a defensive measure well above the level of magic generally mastered by wizards Harry’s age. But even with his broom, his map, his magic, and his loyal friends, Harry isn't safe.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6),,"[""Books"",""Children's Books"",""Growing Up & Facts of Life""]","When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder. Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.",,,,2015.0,,"[{""name"":""Kindle"",""price"":""$0.00"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Rowling-ebook/dp/B0192CTMWI""},{""name"":""Audiobook"",""price"":""Audiobook $0.00"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Book/dp/B017V4NOEG""},{""name"":""Hardcover"",""price"":""$14.74"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Book/dp/0439784549""},{""name"":""Mass Market Paperback"",""price"":""$7.88"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Adult/dp/1551929856""},{""name"":""Audio CD"",""price"":""$51.03"",""url"":""/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Book/dp/0307283658""},{""name"":""Multimedia CD"",""price"":""$63.98"",""url"":""/Half-Blood-HALF-BLOOD-Rowling-Jul-16-2005-Compact/dp/B006DUUOCA""}]",0439785960,9780439785969,0439785960,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nRdIU2qHL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg",4.56,,,,,,,,,652.0,,,1944099.0,,-OnTimeBooks-,"['Rowling', 'J.

I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.”In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as “wildly undisciplined,” Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself.With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.",,,,June 13th 2017,[],Hardcover,,9780062362599,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448064366l/26074156._SY475_.jpg,4.18,"['Lambda Literary Award for Bisexual Nonfiction (2018)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2017)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2017)', 'Reading Women Award for Nonfiction (2017)', 'Brooklyn Public Library Literary Prize Nominee for Nonfiction Shortlist (2018)', 'Litsy Award for Non-Fiction (2017)']",413.0,5.0,,,,95.0,75879.0,306,HarperCollins,"['33822', '26991', '11119', '2871', '1076']",,[],,['Roxane Gay']

After the truth comes out about her age, forty-something porn star Simone Sinclair is handed her walking papers, ending a career that has become more extreme sport than art form. The final straw is her long-time partner’s idea to start their own international studio with a marriage proposal tossed in to sweeten the deal. After two decades of waiting for him to deliver the white picket fence, it’s not exactly the offer she was expecting. At least she doesn’t need a man to answer the alarm of her biological clock. And when she shares a dance with Geri, one of her lesbian gal pals, she discovers she doesn’t need a man to fulfill other fantasies, either. But Geri’s not interested in touch and tease—she wants more than Simone is ready to give. Torn between three dreams—a post-retirement career, a family, or lasting love—Simone retreats to get her head on straight, coming to one conclusion. She can’t have everything. But two out of three is worse than nothing at all…Warning: Contains an over-the-hill porn star with a lot of attitude and a biological clock that is ticking out of control, who refuses to admit she's a lesbian until her best gal pal convinces her to cross the lines of friendship.

How We Fight For Our Lives,,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'LGBT', 'Race', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Anti Racist', 'Biography Memoir', 'African American']","From award-winning poet Saeed Jones, How We Fight for Our Lives is a stunning coming-of-age memoir written at the crossroads of sex, race, and power.“People don’t just happen,” writes Saeed Jones. “We sacrifice former versions of ourselves. We sacrifice the people who dared to raise us. The ‘I’ it seems doesn’t exist until we are able to say, ‘I am no longer yours.’ ”Haunted and haunting, Jones’s memoir tells the story of a young, black, gay man from the South as he fights to carve out a place for himself, within his family, within his country, within his own hopes, desires, and fears. Through a series of vignettes that chart a course across the American landscape, Jones draws readers into his boyhood and adolescence—into tumultuous relationships with his mother and grandmother, into passing flings with lovers, friends and strangers. Each piece builds into a larger examination of race and queerness, power and vulnerability, love and grief: a portrait of what we all do for one another—and to one another—as we fight to become ourselves.Blending poetry and prose, Jones has developed a style that is equal parts sensual, beautiful, and powerful—a voice that’s by turns a river, a blues, and a nightscape set ablaze. How We Fight for Our Lives is a one of a kind memoir and a book that cements Saeed Jones as an essential writer for our time.",,,,October 8th 2019,[],Hardcover,,9781501132735,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564946002l/43682552.jpg,4.28,"['Lambda Literary Award for Gay Memoir/Biography (2020)', 'Kirkus Prize for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2019)']",100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,13154.0,192,Simon and Schuster,"['6125', '5132', '1492', '275', '130']",,[],,['Saeed Jones']

Muted instincts from a soldier on patrol. Violent destruction followed by total darkness. Two weeks later, Scotty Smiley woke up in Walter Reed Army Medical Center, helpless . . . and blind.  Blindness became Scotty’s journey of supreme testing. As he lay helpless in the hospital, Captain Smiley resented the theft of his dreams—becoming a CEO, a Delta Force operator, or a four-star general. With his wife Tiffany’s love and the support of his family and friends, Scotty was transformed—the injury only intensifying his indomitable spirit. Since the moment he jumped out of a hospital bed and forced his way through nurses and cords to take a simple shower, Captain Scotty Smiley has climbed Mount Rainier, won an ESPY as Best Outdoor Athlete, surfed, skydived, become a father, earned an MBA from Duke, taught leadership at West Point, commanded an army company, and won the MacArthur Leadership Award.

A man she's never even met. A man who, by reputation, is one of Scotland's cruelest lairds in over a century. But what choice does she have, with her father dead and her uncle now married to his brother's widow, putting him in charge of not only the Blackthorne fortune, but Sibyl's future as well? Then her betrothed turns out to actually be far worse than his reputation, so headstrong Sibyl decides life as a peasant, or even death, would be preferable to a future with such a despicable man, and makes plans to run away. On an organized hunt for wolves--or, as the Scots call them, wulvers--Sybil escapes her fiancé's clutches, only to find she's run into something far more untamed and dangerous in the middle of the woods. When a big, brawny, long-haired man, who only speaks to her in Gaelic and calls himself Raife, simply picks her up and carries her off with him into the Scottish wild, Sibyl knows she's in trouble. When he takes her to a place no human has ever been, she knows she's gone over the edge.

How Should a Person Be? is a novel of many identities: an autobiography of the mind, a postmodern self-help book, and a fictionalized portrait of the artist as a young woman — of two such artists, in fact.For reasons multiple and mysterious, Sheila finds herself in a quandary of self-doubt, questioning how a person should be in the world. Inspired by her friend Margaux, a painter, and her seemingly untortured ability to live and create, Sheila casts Margaux as material, embarking on a series of recordings in which nothing is too personal, too ugly, or too banal to be turned into art. Along the way, Sheila confronts a cast of painters who are equally blocked in an age in which the blow job is the ultimate art form. She begins questioning her desire to be Important, her quest to be both a leader and a pupil, and her unwillingness to sacrifice herself.Searching, uncompromising and yet mordantly funny, How Should a Person Be? is a brilliant portrait of art-making and friendship from the psychic underground of Canada's most fiercely original writer.",,,September 25th 2010,June 25th 2013,[],Paperback,,9781250032447,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356403692l/15983331.jpg,3.26,"[""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee for Longlist (2013)"", 'RSL Encore Award Nominee (2013)']",13.0,1.0,,,,73.0,11439.0,320,Picador,"['1968', '3177', '3225', '2039', '1030']",,[],,['Sheila Heti']

They say, ""Hey, Mr. Ghost, are you our dear departed king?"" But the ghost don’t say one motherfuckin’ thing. He goes, ""Wooo-wooo-wooo."" They say, ""Hey, we better split, And go tell Hamlet about this shit.""So they run find Hamlet, they say, ""Hey, sweet Prince, Your daddy’s ghost been seen runnin’ hither and hince. He’s all full of maggots and he’s grizzly and grim, Somethin’s rotten in Denmark and -- whew -- we think it’s him."" Hamlet say, ""Oh, are you sure it’s my pop? Did he have matty gray hair with a bald spot on top? Did he have bright blue eyes that never know fearAnd a tattoo says GERTRUDE FOREVER right here?""They say, ""Hey, the thing just flittered by our station, We didn’t give him no phyical examination. And we don’t know for sure if your daddy was the one, But we do know a motherfuckin’ ghost when we see one.""

So they bring ol’ Hamlet to the spot, and thenThey wait five minutes and wooooo ---Here he comes again. He got gray skin, black teeth and hollow eyes, Beckonin’ like this -- young Hamlet cries, ""Hold, spirit of darness, are you a ghostly apparition?"" ""No,"" says the ghost, ""I look like this from malnutrition. Of course I’m a ghost, but sone, don’t be scared, And I’ll tell you some shit that’ll fry your hair.""He says, ""You got two relatives, I won’t say which, But one’s a bloody murderer and one’s a faithless bitch. Why, I was takin’ a nap in the garden right here, When my ambitious brother pours some poison in my ear. And before my body’s even cold he’s wearin’ my pajamas, Layin’ up in my bed with my crown on his head, Doin’ somethin’ sinful to your momma. And the terrible thoughts of what they’re doin’ up thereIs more than a poor old ghost can bear. So you gotta revenge me on this harlot and this knaveOr else I’ll never rest in my motherfuckin’ grave.""Well, this information just flips Hamlet out. He starts walkin’ like this, with spit hangin’ out his mouth. His eyes are all bleary and his tongue looks worse, And he’s talkin’ in couplets and blank fuckin’ verse. I mean the dude is indecisive, He don’t know how he’d like his eggs, And he’s got no opinion on tits, ass or legs. He can’t decide which horse to play at the track, And when they ask him what suit you wanna wear today? He say, ""Ah…um…gimme the black."" He calls his uncle a murderer, Calls his momma a whore, And he can’t get it up for Ophelia no more. Oh, and Ophelia? She’s tryin’ her bestTo make him feel better, Wants to polish his crown jewels, But he won’t let her. ""Stead of sayin’ yea, the fool says nay, And the whole court’s figurin’ he must be gay.Well, then in come Hamlet’s oldest friends, Rosenstern and Guildencrantz, They say, ""Hey there, Ham, you gloomy Gus, Get up – get down – and party with us. We brought you some actores, Some tunes and some lyricsTo put on a play to boost up your spirits."" Hamlet says, ""Hey – songs and skits, That gives me an idea that could stir up some shit. We’ll put on a play –""N"" that could be just the thingTo catch the conscience of the king, If there is a conscience in the motherfuckin’ king.""So Hamlet calls all the actors, he say, ""’Fore this drama starts, I’m gonna tell you suckers how to play your parts. You gotta speak the speech like I pronounced it –Don’t rush it, don’t milk it, don’t drag it, don’t bounce it. I mean, do it trippingly on the tongue, Or else I’ll see your thespian asses strung up and hung. And don’t saw the air with your hands flappin’ wild, ""N’ don’t go mouthin’ my words in some method style.""Then the lead actor says, ""Hey – are we alive?Or just some talking meat that’s gotta listen to this jive?I have read this thing you call a scriptAnd it ain’t too bad, it’s got a few little dips. But with some new dialogue and a few minor edits –Hey, do you mind sharing writer credits? But this part about the king? -- poisoning his brother? I play this wile the real king’s watchin’? Sittin’ with your mother? You must be out of your cotton-pickin’ mind. He’ll cut out my tongue, he’ll gouge out my eyes, He’ll boil me in oil and send me to hell."" Hamlet says, ""How about double scale?"" – The actor says, ""Well…""I want my name above the title, three percent of the gross, I want that tall brunette as my dialogue coach. I want approval of director and a juicy per diem, And if there’s changes in the script, I got to see ‘em. I want a dresser, and undresser and a hairdresser, too, And I gotta-gotta-gotta have the biggest dressing room. I want an escape clause that lets me out in a month, And the first thing I insist is that you fire that cunt. I want transportation to and from every show, I want complimentary tickets for everybody I know. I want my brother and my cousin hired to play in the band, And don’t go tryin’ to sneak in any extra matinees. And next time you wanna speak to me, Check with the director first. Now will you please go away and let us rehearse?"" So Hamlet slinks off, lookin’ for a backer, Mutterin’ how he’ll never ever talk to another fuckin’ actor. And him and Horatio, they walk down a ways, Till they see some clown diggin’ a mouldy grave. Hamlet picks up a skull, he says, ""Who was this sucker?"" They say, ""Yorick."" He says, ""Yorick? I knew the motherfucker. He used to be court jester. Hey, Yorick, show us howYou used to make them funny faces – Why ain’t you laughin’ now? I’ve kissed these lips, I know not how oft."" And Horatio quips, ""Hey, let’s not announce how oft you kissed them lips. I mean people already talkin’ ‘bout the way you walk, And the fact that you ain’t givin’ Ophelia no nook.""Oh, and speakin’ of Ophelia – Polonius, her daddy, Says, ""Hey, that prince is drivin’ my little girl batty. Got her runnin’ all night and sleepin’ till noon, God knows what else he got her doin’. But he’s our royal prince, lord of earth, sky and water, But he’s also a horny little pimply-faced shitheadTrying to hump my daughter."" So Polonius calls Ophelia and says, ""Listen, darlin’ daughter, I hope you and Ham ain’t doin’ things you shouldn’t oughter, ‘Cause you let ‘em touch an ankle and they wanna grab a knee, And they never buy nothin’ that you let ‘em have for free.""Ophelia says, ""Hey, Pop, I know the score, You think I wanna wind up another palace whore? I got the dud sendin’ me letters and babblin’ ‘bout the moon, I really do think his bells are out of tune."" ""Well, don’t you go dingin’ his bells,"" says Polonius, ""’’Cause if he throws you in the grass, I’ll get your big brother Laertes to kick his royal ass.""Now Laertes overhears his name bein’ bandied about, He says, ""Hey, Pop, you signin’ my ass up for somethin’My head don’t know about?"" Plonius says, ""Son, it’s Hamlet, that loony tune, Been fed all his life with a silver spoon. He’s in my face and on my neck, I mean the dude ain’t playin’ with a full damn deck. He’s bumblin’ around twirlin’ his crown, And callin’ me a fishmonger all over town. And he’s charmed your baby sister with his rhymes and his riddles. Hey, you think she’s puttin’ on a little weight around the middle?"" Laertes says, ""Hey, Pop, she ain’t no baby, She got a set of jugs tha’d drive any prince crazy. Now that’s just a natural fact and not lust or incest, And if she shakes ‘em right, she could be a princess."" ""That’s right,"" says Ophelia. ""That’s my scheme, And the way kings been dyin’ ‘round here, I could wind up queen."" ""Enough,"" says Polonius. ""That Pince has ruined my day. Now we gotta see his fuckin’ play within a play. Hell, the place’ll be drafty, the seats won’t be com’fa’ble, I wouldn’t go at all but these tickets ain’t refundable. Prob’ly full of symbolism, I won’t understand it, Shit, I hope it rains and all the critics pan it.""So they go to the play and everybody’s there. They got diamonds on their doublets, They got ribbons in their hair. Lords, ladies, dogs, babies, all in attendance, The marquee says MURDER, DECEIT AND VENGEANCE. ONE OF YEAR’S TEN BEST. DO NOT MISS IT.So everybody figures it’s another piece of shit. And they’re bitchin’ ‘bout their seats, buckin’ the line, Scalpin’ tickets and sippin’ wine, Rattlin’ their programs, twistin’ in their chairs, Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. Then the play begins – and ooh, looky here –It shows the king puttin’ poison in his brother’s ear. And King Claudius is watchin’, and -- ooh -- is he pissed. He says, ""I know who’s responsible for this."" He calls, ""Hey Gertie, come here, hon. What the hell’s the matter with your jive-ass son? I give the kid room, board ‘n’ remedial education, And he calls me a murderer, and other wild accusations. Hell, I’d sue him for libel for implyin’ that shit. But the libel laws ain’t been invented yet. Just ‘cause I’m bangin’ you, he’s givin’ me hell, I think he wants to hump you his own damn self.""Queen Gertrude says, ""I think he’s goin’ throughAn Oedipal rejection, seein’ his uncleReplace his father in his momma’s affection."" ""Oedipal?"" says the king. ""The punk is givin’ me some shit.I’ll send him where I sent his pop if he don’t quit.So you tell him it’s better to leave some things unsaid,Or he’ll be puttin’ on his crown without his motherfuckin’ head."" So the queen runs to Hamlet, she says, ""Oh listen, son, Y’better suck up to the king before some foul deed gets done.It’s true he wears black socks and Hawaiian shirts,But that ain’t no reason to treat him like dirt,Because he is your uncle, and I do wear his ring,And most of all, he is the motherfuckin’ king."" ""Don’t say mother-fuckin’ king,"" says Hamlet. ""Please, Somehow that phrase makes my blood freeze. My daddy was a handsome dude with dignity and class, And this fat fool got hair on his back and boils on his ass. Can anybody get you in their goddamn bedJust ‘cause they got a crown on their goddamned head?"" His momma says, ""Hey, before you go off the deep end, There’s some things about women you gotta comprehend.""Now milkmaids and queens, we all have filet mignon dreams, But when the steak is gone, you will eat the beans. And when you’re out of beans, you’ll chew the shoes off their feet, But you eat. Just picture me – a sweet young thing, Then boom – my husband’s dead – and this sucker’s king. So it’s ‘heat the meat and act real sweet’Or wind up with my ass out in the goddamned street. I got cellulite, I got varicose veins, I got a hip gets stiff every time it rains. And -- this -- is what nursing a baby can do, ""Course, honey, I’m not blamin’ you, Though you were such a hungry child, But life goes on and a queen must smile.""Then hark – just then Hamlet hears a soundFrom behind the curtain – like a mouse skitt’rin’ ‘round.But it’s really Ophelia’s daddy, spyin’ for the king,Listenin’ and takin’ down everything.Hamlet yells, ""A rat!"" and he stabs at the place,And kerplunk, out falls Polonius on his eavedroppin’ face.Hamlet sees it ain’t the king, he says, ""Oh shit,Y’finally do take action and this is what you get.Now I killed my girlfriend’s poppa and I’m covered with his blood,How do you explain this to someone you love?""Then here comes Ophelia, callin’, ""Daddy, Daddy dear,Hamlet, is my daddy in here?"" Well…he is… and he ain’t – but someone should have told the catY’don’t wanna get stabbed, don’t make noise like a rat.She cries, ""Oh, my daddy’s dead and I can see You stuck it in him like you stuck it in me. I can’t believe the shit you done to me. You used to want all – now you want none of me. Is this your perverted way of makin’ fun o’ me?"" Hamlet says, ""Hey then, get thee someplace…Maybe a … a nunnery."" ""Get me to a nunnery?"" Ophelia moans, ""Now that you ate the chicken, you wanna try and hide the bones? With your poetry and promises you messed up my brain, You are a dirty dog – and not a great Dane."" ""Please,"" says Hamlet, ""I’m in a crazed condition. Can’t you see I’m torn by indecision? To be or not to be? That’s the fuckin’ questionThat’s givin’ me migraines and indigestion. Should I take arms against a sea of trouble, Or just walk around goin’ gubble-gubble-gubble?""Ophelia says, ""Hey, you don’t fool me a bit,You’re fakin’ all this psycho shit, ‘Cause if you’re insane you don’t have to kill the king, Or marry me or do any damn thing."" Ham says, ""Hey, go bake a cake, or give your booty a shake,Or take a jump in the motherfuckin’ lake –""Well, that’s where he made another fatal mistake. Y’see he didn’t really mean for the bitch to do it, But she’s gone like a flash, and run, jump, splash, She’s floatin’ and bloatin’ ‘fore anybody knew it.""Oh, when it rains it pours,"" says Hamlet, ""Ain’t no doubt, Here’s another thing I gotta feel guilty about.""Well, they have Ophelia’s funeral and everybody’s there.They got diamonds on their doublet, they got ribbons in their hair. They’re rattlin’ their beads and twistin’ in their chairs, Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. And it’s a pleasant event, until into her graveLeaps her brother Laertes and he rants and raves. He’s shakin’ his fist and pullin’ his hair, Gettin’ his ass tangled up in his underwear, Jumpin’ up and down in a frenzied fit, Meanwhile stompin’ her body to shit. He cries, ""FEE-FO-FI, if I find the guy who caused her to die, I’ll slice him like a pie. I’ll cut out his heart and send it to Peru, ‘N’ I’ll c.o.d. his balls off to Timbuktu, Ship his dick to England in a registered letter, And then let him try to get his shit back together."" Then the king pulls his coat, he says, ""Harken to this, Hamlet’s the dude who fucked up your sis. And he also stabbed your daddy, too, And all you do is boo-hoo-hoo? What kind of brother and son are you?If it was my family I know what I’d do, I’d be on him like a damned tattoo. Now… there is a sword with a poisoned tip. It’ll send any sucker on a one-way trip, ‘Cause all it takes is one itty bitty scratch…Hey, Hamlet, how about a little fencin’ match?""Well, then the whole fuckin’ place caves in, Hamlet stabs Laertes and Laertes stabs him. Then Hamlet turns around and stabs his uncle, too, While the queen drinks some poison the king had brewed. So she dies, he dies, Hamlet dies, Laertes diesOn top of where Ophelia lies, Right next to where Polonius died. And before you can wink, blink or turn your head, Chop-stab-slice -- every motherfucker’s dead.Then in walks this cat Fortinbras, he says, ""What – is -- this?I have never seen such a fuckin’ mess. You got skulls and swords, you got guts and gore, You got bodies piled up from ceiling to floor. You got broken glass, y’got tangled hairs, You got blood and wine runnin’ down the stairs. You got dented armor and ripped up gowns, You got bent-up crowns just rollin’ ‘round. Y’got a punctured king, y’got a poisoned queen, Y’got a sweet prince dyin’ on the mezzanine. And behind that curtain there’s another dead duff, And a body from the fishpond just floated up. Y’got a stiff in the garden with some gunk in his ear, And a tatto says GERTRUDE FOREVER right here, And two guards on the gate tower drunk on beer. What the hell’s been goin’ on here?""Well, that was the end of our sweet prince, He died in confusion and nobody’s seen him since.

The story is a simple one but the overtones are immediately present. ""Natalie Waite who was seventeen years old but who felt that she had been truly conscious only since she was about fifteen lived in an odd corner of a world of sound and sight, past the daily voices of her father and mother and their incomprehensible actions."" In a few graphic pages, the family is before us—Arnold Waite, a writer, egotistical and embittered; his wife, the complaining martyr; Bud, the younger brother who has not yet felt the need to establish his independence; and Natalie, in the nightmare of being seventeen. The Sunday afternoon cocktail party, to which Arnold Waite has invited his literary friends and neighbors, serves to etch in the details of this family's life, and to draw Natalie into the vortex. The story concentrates on the next few critical months in Natalie's life, away at college, where each experience reproduces on a larger scale the crucial failure of her emotional life at home. With a mounting tension rising from character and situation as well as the particular magic of which Miss Jackson is master, the novel proceeds inexorably to the stinging melodrama of its conclusion.

She quickly attracted a loyal following that was captivated by the upbeat mother happily raising her young children, madly in love with her husband, Christian (Mr. Nielson to her readers), and filled with gratitude for her blessed life.However, everything changed in an instant on a sunny day in August 2008, when Stephanie and Christian were in a horrific plane crash. Christian was burned over 40 percent of his body, and Stephanie was on the brink of death, with burns over 80 percent of her body. She would remain in a coma for four months.In the aftermath of this harrowing tragedy, Stephanie maintained a stunning sense of humor, optimism, and resilience. She has since shared this strength of spirit with others through her blog, in magazine features, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Now, in this moving memoir, Stephanie tells the full, extraordinary story of her unlikely recovery and the incredible love behind it—from a riveting account of the crash to all that followed in its wake. With vivid detail, Stephanie recounts her emotional and physical journey, from her first painful days after awakening from the coma to the first time she saw her face in the mirror, the first kiss she shared with Christian after the accident, and the first time she talked to her children after their long separation. She also reflects back on life before the accident, to her happy childhood as one of nine siblings, her close-knit community and strong Mormon faith, and her fairy-tale love story, all of which became her foundation of strength as she rebuilt her life.What emerges from the wreckage of a tragic accident is a unique perspective on joy, beauty, and overcoming adversity that is as gripping as it is inspirational.

Hamlet in Purgatory,,Drama,"Stephen Greenblatt sets out to explain his longtime fascination with the ghost of Hamlet's father, and his daring and ultimately gratifying journey takes him through surprising intellectual territory. It yields an extraordinary account of the rise and fall of Purgatory as both a belief and a lucrative institution--as well as a capacious new reading of the power of Hamlet. In the mid-sixteenth century, English authorities abruptly changed the relationship between the living and dead. Declaring that Purgatory was a false ""poem,"" they abolished the institutions and banned the practices that Christians relied on to ease the passage to Heaven for themselves and their dead loved ones. Greenblatt explores the fantastic adventure narratives, ghost stories, pilgrimages, and imagery by which a belief in a grisly ""prison house of souls"" had been shaped and reinforced in the Middle Ages. He probes the psychological benefits as well as the high costs of this belief and of its demolition. With the doctrine of Purgatory and the elaborate practices that grew up around it, the church had provided a powerful method of negotiating with the dead. The Protestant attack on Purgatory destroyed this method for most people in England, but it did not eradicate the longings and fears that Catholic doctrine had for centuries focused and exploited. In his strikingly original interpretation, Greenblatt argues that the human desires to commune with, assist, and be rid of the dead were transformed by Shakespeare--consummate conjurer that he was--into the substance of several of his plays, above all the weirdly powerful Hamlet. Thus, the space of Purgatory became the stage haunted by literature's most famous ghost. This book constitutes an extraordinary feat that could have been accomplished by only Stephen Greenblatt. It is at once a deeply satisfying reading of medieval religion, an innovative interpretation of the apparitions that trouble Shakespeare's tragic heroes, and an exploration of how a culture can be inhabited by its own spectral leftovers.",,,,2002.0,,,0691102570,9780691102573,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G1d_Cq5Yfp8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.94,,,,,,,,,344.0,,,209.0,,,['Stephen Greenblatt']

Hearts in Atlantis,,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery', 'War', 'Historical Fiction']","Five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. In Part One, ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.",,Film tie-in,09/14/99,2001,"['The Crimson King', 'American Law Enforcement', 'Ted Brautigan', 'Bobby Garfield', 'Liz Garfield', 'Carol Gerber', 'John Sullivan', 'Peter Riley', 'Willie Shearman', 'Ronnie Malenfant']",Paperback,,9780340818671,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374048926l/11602.jpg,3.83,"['World Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Collection (2000)', 'British Fantasy Award Nominee for Best Collection (2000)']",5709.0,81.0,,,,91.0,83753.0,640,New English Library,"['24425', '29552', '22318', '6030', '1428']",,[],,['Stephen King']

He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the New York Times Book Review, ""No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . . [Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.""  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection, and challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control,,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Technology', 'Philosophy', 'Computer Science', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Business', 'Computers']","
  A leading artificial intelligence researcher lays out a new approach to AI that will enable us to coexist successfully with increasingly intelligent machines
In the popular imagination, superhuman artificial intelligence is an approaching tidal wave that threatens not just jobs and human relationships, but civilization itself. Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable.In this groundbreaking book, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage.If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial.In a 2014 editorial co-authored with Stephen Hawking, Russell wrote, ""Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last."" Solving the problem of control over AI is not just possible; it is the key that unlocks a future of unlimited promise.",,,,October 8th 2019,[],Hardcover,,9780525558613,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1561637199l/44767248.jpg,4.19,[],100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,1073.0,352,Viking,"['439', '435', '167', '27', '5']",,[],,['Stuart Russell']

Unfortunately, there are others who disagree. One night while stumbling back to bed from her nightly visit to the bathroom, Peg is stopped in her tracks by two women standing in her bedroom.

His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire,,"['History', 'Biography', 'India', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Leadership', 'Indian Literature', 'War']","The man whom Indian nationalists perceived as the “George Washington of India” and who was President of the Indian National Congress in 1938–1939 is a legendary figure. Called Netaji (“leader”) by his countrymen, Subhas Chandra Bose struggled all his life to liberate his people from British rule and, in pursuit of that goal, raised and led the Indian National Army against Allied Forces during World War II. His patriotism, as Gandhi asserted, was second to none, but his actions aroused controversy in India and condemnation in the West.
  
Now, in a definitive biography of the revered Indian nationalist, Sugata Bose deftly explores a charismatic personality whose public and private life encapsulated the contradictions of world history in the first half of the twentieth century. He brilliantly evokes Netaji’s formation in the intellectual milieu of Calcutta and Cambridge, probes his thoughts and relations during years of exile, and analyzes his ascent to the peak of nationalist politics. Amidst riveting accounts of imprisonment and travels, we glimpse the profundity of his struggle: to unite Hindu and Muslim, men and women, and diverse linguistic groups within a single independent Indian nation. Finally, an authoritative account of his untimely death in a plane crash will put to rest rumors about the fate of this “deathless hero.”

Talents are people born with supernatural powers, feared by the population at large. Possession of an “unregistered ability” has become illegal, and those who are discovered are forcibly removed to government-run research facilities. For Talents, keeping their secret is the most important thing in their lives. For some, that need for secrecy begins to define who they are.That’s how it is for Joss, a high school girl who does everything in her power to go unnoticed. She's incredibly bright, but strives to maintain grades that are good yet not too good. She doesn't participate in school activities, keeps quiet in class, eats by herself. Despite her longtime crush on Dylan, she wouldn't even think about trying to talk to him. Joss doesn't make friends of any kind, because friends can draw attention, friends can make you slip up, friends can make things complicated.When new girl, Kat, steps in to rescue Joss from an uncomfortable situation with Marco, the class jerk, she doesn’t realize what she’s getting into, and it blows up in her face.

No one succeeds more brilliantly at blending these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple with the deepest emotions and the highest risks. And there's no better proof than Hot Target. Like most men of action, Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter never learned how to take a vacation. So when he finds himself facing a month's leave, he offers his services to Troubleshooters Incorporated. Founded by a former SEAL, the private-sector security firm is a major player in the ongoing war against terrorism, known for carrying out covert missions too volatile for official U.S. military action. But the first case Richter takes on is anything but under the radar.High-profile maverick movie producer Jane Mercedes Chadwick hasn't quite completed her newest film, but she's already courting controversy. The World War II epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a real-life hero-and the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups. But despite a relentless campaign of angry E-mails, phone calls, and smear tactics, Chadwick won't be pressured into abandoning the project. Then the harassment turns to death threats.While the FBI appears on the scene, nervous Hollywood associates call in Troubleshooters, and now Chadwick has an army of round-the-clock bodyguards, whether she likes it or not. And she definitely doesn't. But her stubbornness doesn't make FBI agent Jules Cassidy's job any easier. The fiercely independent filmmaker presents yet another emotional obstacle that Cassidy doesn't need-he's already in the midst of a personal tug-of-war with his ex-lover, while fighting a growing attraction to Chadwick's brother.Determined to succeed-and survive-on her own terms, Chadwick will face off with enemies and allies alike. But she doesn't count on the bond she forms with the quiet, capable Cosmo Richter. Yet even as their feelings bring them closer, the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter. And when all hell erupts, desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap them both in the crossfire.From the Hardcover edition.",Troubleshooters #8,,12/28/04,November 29th 2005,"['Cosmo Richter', 'Jane Mercedes Chadwick', 'Jules Cassidy', 'Robin Chadwick', 'Adam Wyndham']",Paperback,,9780345456953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1370731066l/154041.jpg,4.25,[],82.0,1.0,,,,98.0,7271.0,534,Ballantine Books,"['3266', '2758', '1072', '140', '35']",,"['Hollywood, California (United States)', 'California (United States)']",,['Suzanne Brockmann']

Guarding lives is her game, and no one plays it better.

But then, while investigating a suspect, Alyssa is ambushed and suddenly finds herself imprisoned by The Dentist.

Sie sitzen Abend für Abend am Tresen, trinken Kristallweizen ohne Zitrone und gehen erst ins Bett, wenn Mutti in Bremen schon wieder aufsteht. Und wenn draußen die Mauer fällt, bestellen sie erst mal in Ruhe noch ein Bier. Denn was ist schon das Ende der Geschichte (denkt sich der Leser am Ende dieser Geschichte) gegen die Frage, ob die Zeit schneller oder langsamer vergeht, wenn man betrunken ist? Herr Lehmann ist Kreuzberger. Kreuzberger sind Menschen, die irgendwann einmal aus Schwaben, Achim oder Herford nach Berlin gekommen und dort ""hängen geblieben"" sind. Herr Lehmann kommt ursprünglich aus Bremen und möchte eigentlich Frank genannt werden, aber das ignorieren seine Freunde: denn bald ist Herrn Lehmanns dreißigster Geburtstag. Und 30 Jahre alt zu werden, weiß Herr Lehmann, ist Scheiße, weil man da langsam ""beginnt, eine Vergangenheit zu haben, eine gute alte Zeit und den ganzen Scheiß."" Und weil auf einmal alle anfangen zu fragen, was man denn bitte schön anfangen wolle mit dem eigenen Leben. Denn dass jemand zufrieden damit ist, Kellner zu sein, ist in dieser Stadt, in der alle ""eigentlich Künstler"" sind, nicht vorgesehen -- ""aber was ist das für ein trauriger Umgang mit dem, was man tut, wenn man es immer nur als Zwischenlösung ansieht, als nichts Richtiges?"" Sven Regener kennt, wovon er schreibt. Als Sänger und Texter der Berliner Band Element of Crime ist er seit genau jenen Spätachtzigern, in denen die Romanhandlung spielt, immer auch genauer Chronist eines Kreuzberger Lebensgefühls jenseits von ""Kreuzberger Nächte sind lang"" gewesen. Mit Herr Lehmann ist ihm das erstaunliche Kunststück gelungen, jene zärtlich-rotzige Nonchalance, die seine Lieder auszeichnet, umstandslos in die lange Form zu überführen -- und das gleich in seinem literarischen Erstlingswerk! Mit seinem Roman setzt Regener jenem merkwürdig zeitlosen Kreuzberg der Vorwendezeit, das einem heute so weit weg erscheinen will, so etwas wie ein Denkmal -- für die Zeit Damals hinterm Mond. Doch trotz so schöner Einsichten wie ""Der Elekrolytmangel ist der größte Feind des Trinkers. Von der Dehydrierung einmal abgesehen"", geht es hier keineswegs nur ums Bohème-Leben im Allgemeinen und ums Trinken im Besonderen. Das Ganze ist nämlich auch eine Art Entwicklungsroman -- freilich zu Kreuzberger Bedingungen: Muss doch der Held -- für den es anfangs noch eine Qual ist, wenn er auf dem Weg von Kreuzberg nach Kreuzberg durch Neukölln muss -- gegen Ende des Romans immerhin zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass es auch hinter der Oberbaumbrücke noch Menschen gibt.

It isn’t until she meets Chevalier that she learns of her startling family history, a history that immediately throws her into the volatile world of the heku.In a bid to protect her, Chevalier moves Emily into his isolated coven, which marks her as a prime target for the Valle and the Encala, enemy factions of the heku. Emily fights to fit into the militaristic world of the heku as her head-strong personality and independent ways turn their perfectly balanced world on end. She immediately befriends Kyle, a heku from Chevalier’s coven, and together they find Emily a niche among the immortal.Emily’s violent past interferes with Chevalier’s plans, and he must first undo what her abusive ex-husband did before he can convince her how much he cares about her, and how much she’s worth to his faction. Chevalier’s growing feelings for Emily are unnatural to his kind, and must be hidden from the rest of the Equites Faction if he’s to remain a formidable part of their Council.His jealous tendencies rage as Emily gets closer to Kyle, and both heku struggle to make her realize how important she is to the faction and how endangered she now is.",Heku #1,,08/28/10,,[],Kindle Edition,,B0041845Q2,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328359905l/9505037.jpg,4.0,[],134.0,2.0,,,,86.0,1145.0,340,,"['551', '263', '174', '90', '67']",,[],,['T.

She can cope with the myriad of daily difficulties and decisions that a homeschooling lifestyle brings with it, as long as she is having the right responses to them. Let her be fearful, worried, anxious, frustrated, irritated, or angry and a mom soon realizes she is undermining all she wants to accomplish by homeschooling. Because Teri Maxwell, a mother of eight, has walked the homeschooling path since 1985, she knows first-hand the struggle for a meek and quiet spirit. The memories from her early homeschooling years of often being worried and angry rather than having a meek and quiet spirit are not what she would like them to be.Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit includes Teri sharing the work the Lord has done in her heart through homeschooling. Other homeschooling moms will be encouraged that He can do the same for them. Teri also desires that homeschooling mothers could learn from the lessons the Lord has taught her so that they would begin to have a meek and quiet spirit long before she did.Will the reader's journey toward a meek and quiet spirit be completed upon finding the perfect spelling curriculum or deciding which chores a child should be doing? Or does the answer lie on a different path? In these pages, Teri offers practical insights into gaining a meek and quiet spirit, along with chapter-by-chapter projects, that any mom can apply to her individual circumstances. She transparently shares the struggles God has brought her through and what He has shown her during these many homeschooling years.Throughout Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit, the heart issues that will gently lead you to a meek and quiet spirit are discovered.

How Stella Got Her Groove Back,,"['Fiction', 'Romance', 'African American', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'African American Literature', 'American']","How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life--and what she must risk to do it. Stella Payne is forty-two, divorced, a high-powered investment analyst, mother of eleven-year-old Quincy- and she does it all. In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love--and all of love's nasty fallout--anyway.But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core--not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean--and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.",,,10/30/96,January 6th 2004,[],Paperback,,9780451209146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348976850l/122205.jpg,3.75,[],100.0,1.0,,,,90.0,8855.0,401,Berkley Books,"['2416', '2902', '2664', '694', '179']",,['Jamaica'],,['Terry McMillan']

The great heritage of western civilization - from the Greek and Roman classics to Jewish and Christian works - would have been utterly lost were it not for the holy men and women of unconquered Ireland. In this delightful and illuminating look into a crucial but little-known ""hinge"" of history, Thomas Cahill takes us to the ""island of saints and scholars, "" the Ireland of St. Patrick and the Book of Kells. Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the west's written treasures. With the return of stability in Europe, these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning.

But that one word should be ""civilization."" Western civilization has given us the miracles of modern science, the wealth of free-market economics, the security of the rule of law, a unique sense of human rights and freedom, charity as a virtue, splendid art and music, a philosophy grounded in reason, and innumerable other gifts that we take for granted as the wealthiest and most powerful civilization in history. But what is the ultimate source of these gifts? Bestselling author and professor Thomas E. Woods, Jr. provides the long neglected answer: the Catholic Church. Woods’s story goes far beyond the familiar tale of monks copying manuscripts and preserving the wisdom of classical antiquity. In How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, you’ll learn: · Why modern science was born in the Catholic Church · How Catholic priests developed the idea of free-market economics five hundred years before Adam Smith · How the Catholic Church invented the university · Why what you know about the Galileo affair is wrong · How Western law grew out of Church canon law · How the Church humanized the West by insisting on the sacredness of all human life No institution has done more to shape Western civilization than the two-thousand-year-old Catholic Church—and in ways that many of us have forgotten or never known.

All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter.

Steadfastly devout in her faith, and retaining the deep belief that her soul is innately tarnished as a branded ‘Cursed woman of Eve’, Delilah is determined to find her way home to her people in The Order and away from the corrupt and damned outlaw motorcycle club—The Hades Hangmen—who hold her at their secluded compound for her protection—a 'protection' she strongly resents.

Conditioned her entire life to believe she is a witch... a life-long temptress… the devil’s whore... Delilah increasingly resents her beautiful face, her shapely body and her sensuous effect on men. But when a man of the motorcycle club—a deeply sinful yet stunningly beautiful man—is charged with her care, Delilah begins to see that this dangerous and moralless sinner from the 'outside' may offer her something she did not know could truly exist: unconditional love.Kyler ‘Ky’ Willis loves his life: a daily abundance of brotherhood, liquor, the freedom of the open-road and—best of all—his pick of hot women. Raised a biker brat and now VP of the most notorious MC in the States, Ky has no shortage of club sluts warming his bed; a situation he takes full advantage of… until a certain blonde enters his life… a gorgeous pilgrim-blonde he can’t get out of his head… a pilgrim-blonde he and his club recently-rescued from some backward religious cult… and a pilgrim-blonde he’s been ordered to keep the hell away from and his whorish hands off.When yet another in a lengthy line of drunken blunders forces Ky to reluctantly take charge of the pilgrim-blonde’s care, he realizes that there could be more to this woman than just supermodel looks and a stacked set of tits. He begins to see that she could be the woman who could do the impossible—tame his wild ways and capture his reluctant heart.But the unyielding bonds of Lilah’s past are strong, her ‘people’ determined and, with a new Prophet in charge and hell bent on revenge, they are mightily reluctant to let her go...Dark Contemporary Romance.Contains explicit sexual situations, violence, disturbingly sensitive and taboo subjects, offensive language, and very mature topics.Recommended for age 18 years and up*",Hades Hangmen #2,,,December 13th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,B00QZLSQ9U,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415799095l/22107044.jpg,4.22,[],128.0,2.0,,,,95.0,18907.0,503,,"['8986', '6265', '2749', '665', '242']",,[],,['Tillie Cole']

When he was three years old, Tito was diagnosed as severely autistic, but his remarkable mother, Soma, determined that he would overcome the problem by teaching him to read and write. The result was that between the ages of eight and eleven he wrote stories and poems of exquisite beauty, which Dr. Oliver Sacks called amazing and shocking. Their eloquence gave lie to all our assumptions about autism.Here Tito goes even further and writes of how the autistic mind works, how it views the outside world and the normal people he deals with daily, how he tells his stories to the mirror and hears stories back, how sounds become colors, how beauty fills his mind and heart. With this work, Tito whom Portia Iversen, co-founder of Cure Autism Now, has described as a window into autism such as the world has never seen gives the world a beacon of hope.

The genealogy of early Calvinist Puritanism mixed with the techno-scientific religion of boundless economic progress and legally veiled in the obscure para-Biblical and Jewish-inspired sense of political self-chosenness, created a system that has little in common with its original design.

How to Read the Psalms,,"['Theology', 'Old Testament', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Christian', 'Poetry', 'Biblical', 'Religion', 'Reference', 'Academic']","The Psalms possess an enduring fascination for us. For frankness, directness, intensity and intimacy, they are unrivaled in all of Scripture. Somehow the psalmists seem to have anticipated all our awe, desires and frustrations. No wonder Christians have used the Psalms in worship from the earliest times to the present. Yet the Psalms cause us difficulties when we look at them closely. Their poetry is unfamiliar in form. Many images they use are foreign to us today. And the psalmists sometimes express thoughts that seem unworthy of Scripture. Tremper Longman gives us the kind of help we need to overcome the distance between the psalmists' world and ours. He explains the various kinds of psalms, the way they were used in Hebrew worship and their relationship to the rest of the Old Testament. Then he looks at how Christians can appropriate their message and insights today. Turning to the art of Old Testament poetry, he explains the use of parallelism and imagery. Step-by-step suggestions for interpretating the psalms on our own are followed by exercises for further study and reflection. Also included is a helpful guide to commentaries on the Psalms.

They are woven into the web of divine revelation, rooted in the ""fear of the Lord"" that is the beginning of wisdom. While many proverbs speak to us directly, we can gain much greater insight by studying the book of Proverbs as a whole, understanding its relationship to ancient non-Israelite wisdom and listening to its conversation with the other great voices of wisdom in Scripture--Job and Ecclesiastes.

High Times,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'German Literature']","Sie war die weibliche Ikone der 68er-Bewegung, dazu Model, Muse, Groupie, Lebenshungrige. Das Bett teilte sie mit Mick Jagger und Keith Richards, kaum eine Droge hat sie ausgelassen -- sie stand für die neue, freizügige Weiblichkeit, die alles konnte und alles machte. In High Times schildert Uschi Obermaier in authentischem Erzählton Episoden aus ihrem wilden Leben. Grundlage sind 50 Stunden Interview mit dem Journalisten und Drehbuchautor Olaf Kraemer aus dem Jahr 1992. Das Material lag dann fast 15 Jahre auf Eis, weil es sowohl ihr selbst als auch zahlreichen deutschen Verlagen zu drastisch erschien. Nun hat sie es doch publiziert, in ihrem ganz eigenen Sound, der perfekt zu dem rasanten Leben passt, das jahrzehntelang wie ein Roadmovie im Zeitraffer ablief. Zu Anfang sehen wir die kleine Uschi in Sendling, schon damals war sie von den ""wilden Jungs"" im Ort fasziniert. Da gab's die ersten Kellerpartys, geraucht wurde ""Judenstrick"" und nebenbei ""so'n bisschen an den Titties angefasst"". Dann kam der erste Sex, Sex in der Kirche, im Freien, in der Isetta, überall wurde ""rumgemacht"", die Entdeckung der Lust hatte etwas Religiöses. Es folgte der Sprung nach München, sie ""eroberte die Welt an der Seite eines Mannes"", im Big Apple wurde bis morgens gesoffen, gekifft, gesnift und geliebt. Immer schon wollte Uschi Obermaier Verbotenes ausprobieren. Sie ging mit den durchreisenden Musikern aufs Hotelzimmer, schmiss LSD-Trips und machte die ersten Foto-Shootings. 1968 begegnete ihr mit Rainer Langhans die erste große Liebe, Stichwort: Kommune 1 in Berlin. Für die Medien waren sie ""das schönste Paar der APO"" (Stern). Dabei war Uschi Obermaier hoffnungslos unpolitisch und blieb für die übrigen Kommunarden immer das dumme Fotomodell, das bei den endlosen Gruppensessions regelmäßig einschlief. Schließlich ging es zurück nach München, Mick Jagger und Keith Richards klingelten in derselben Nacht an ihrer Tür -- Ersterer machte damals das Rennen, zu dem geplanten Dreier mit David Bowie ist es niemals gekommen. Es folgten die zehn intensiven und selbstzerstörerischen Jahre mit Dieter Bockhorn, dem wilden Prinzen aus Hamburg, mit dem sie nach Indien reiste und im Wohnmobil durch die USA tourte, der aber immer mehr in seiner Drogensucht versank. High Times steht für Sex, Drugs, Rock'n Roll -- dennoch werden Voyeure in dem Buch weniger auf ihre Kosten kommen, dafür aber all diejenigen, die sich ein authentisches Bild einer ganz ungewöhnlichen Stil-Ikone machen wollen.-- Henrik Flor, Literaturtest",,,01/01/94,,[],,,9783000261381,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357919449l/6467235.jpg,3.7,[],95.0,1.0,,,,86.0,97.0,,,"['27', '30', '26', '12', '2']",,[],,"['Uschi Obermaier', 'Natalia Avelon']"
Hear Me Roar,,['Poetry'],"Author Vpain has lyrically recorded her life lessons in Hear Me Roar. After what seemed an endless addiction to love- wounds began to heal, and a greater value of self came forth. As author Vpain discovers what it means to be a woman, she documented each step in her struggle for actualization. She reaches out to people of all calibers who seek to break the destructive or abusive cycles which can plague their lives. Using several different poetic forms, she ranges from raw poetic motion to sensual sonnets. Just when you fall in love, you may laugh- and shortly thereafter shed a tear. This emotional poetry collection is aimed at a mature audience, yet some poetry may be appropriate to share with younger loved ones. Brace yourself for Hear Me Roar.

Heridas del viento,,[],"Armenia, el país en el que todo es posible, el país que, como eterna Arca de Noé, pone a resguardo de tempestades humanas y de las otras, variopintas especies de su cultura milenaria. Allí se convive con una historia extravagante en la que persas, árabes, mongoles, turcos y rusos han querido llevar el timón. Aún hoy Armenia, el viejo país de cuatro mil años, el primero de la cristiandad, el que ejerce de bisagra entre oriente y occidente, mantiene más del doble de su población en la diáspora. Ser armenio significa ser superviviente: guerras, invasiones, terremotos, masacres y un pavoroso genocidio que se llevó un millón y medio de vidas, según sus cuentas. Este libro habla de historias imposibles, pero ciertas. Personajes que levantan hoy el país con mucho amor y mejor humor. Virginia Mendoza entra en sus casas y comparte mesa con algunos de los últimos supervivientes de ese genocidio, visita a los yazidíes que rinden culto a Melek Taus, el Ángel Pavo Real, o a los cristianos molokanes, bebedores de leche; habla con la viuda del constructor de un templo subterráneo para salvar a la humanidad del fuego; nos presenta a los homenajeadores de Jachaturian y a la nieta de una esclava. Voces sabias, a veces llenas de melancolía, pero siempre esperanzadas. No deja de ser una ironía amarga que el símbolo de su identidad, el monte Ararat, esté del otro lado de la frontera como emblema de la presencia de una ausencia. Pero «no intentes comprender.

Hunger's Brides,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Suspense', '21st Century', 'Literature', 'Mystery', '17th Century', 'Unfinished', 'Canada', 'Religion']","An epic novel of genius and obsession — apocalyptic, lyrical and erotically charged. Spanning three centuries and two cultures, Hunger’s Brides brings to vivid life the greatest Spanish poet of her time, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, and plumbs a mystery that has intrigued writers as diverse as Robert Graves, Diane Ackerman, Eduardo Galeano and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Why did a writer of such gifts silence herself?At the time of her death in 1695, Juana Inés de la Cruz was arguably the greatest writer working in any European tongue, yet she had never set foot in Europe. Instead she was born among the descendants of the Aztec empire, in the shadow of the mountain pass Cortés and his troops descended on their advance to Montezuma’s capital. A child prodigy from a barbarous wilderness, her beauty and wit provoked a sensation at the viceregal court in Mexico City. But at the age of nineteen, still a favourite of the court, Juana entered a convent, and from that point her life unfolded between the mystery of her sudden flight from palace to cloister, and the enigma of her final vow of silence, signed in blood. After a quarter-century of graceful, often sensuous poetry, plays and theological argument, Sor Juana chose silence, which she maintained until she died of plague at the age of forty-five.Drawing on chronicles of the conquest and histories of the Inquisition, myth cycles and archeological studies, ancient poetry and early Spanish accounts of blood sacrifice, Hunger’s Brides is a mammoth work of inspired historical fiction framed in a contemporary mystery. In the dead of a Calgary winter night, a man escapes from an apartment in which a young woman lies bleeding — in his arms he clutches a box he has found on her table addressed to him. He is Donald Gregory, a once-respected, now-disgraced, academic. She is Beulah Limosneros, one of his students, and for a brief time his lover. Brilliant, erratic, voracious, she had disappeared two years earlier in Mexico, following the thread of her growing obsession with Sor Juana. Over the ensuing days and weeks, as a police investigation closes in around him, Gregory pieces together the contents of the box she has left him: a poetic journal of her travel in Mexico, diaries, research notes, unposted letters, and a strange manuscript — part biography, part novel — on Sor Juana.Hunger’s Brides is a dramatic unveiling of three intimate journeys: a man’s forced march to self-knowledge, a great poet’s withdrawal from the world, and a profane mystic’s pilgrimage into modern Mexico, in which the bones of the past constantly poke through a present built on the ruins of the vanquished.Excerpt from Hunger’s Brides“From the moment I was first illuminated by the light of reason, my inclination toward letters has been so vehement that not even the admonitions of others . . . nor my own meditations have been sufficient to cause me to forswear this natural impulse that God placed in me . . . that inclination exploded in me like gunpowder. . . .” —Sor Juana, in a letter of self-defence written to a bishop in 1691, just before she took a vow of silenceFrom the Hardcover edition.",,,11/06/04,July 27th 2011,[],Paperback,,9780679312000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1190150361l/1907716._SX318_.jpg,3.66,[],93.0,1.0,,,,81.0,140.0,1376,Vintage Canada,"['47', '39', '28', '11', '15']",,[],,['W.

The father-son pair of Hotspur (Lord Henry Percy) and his father, the Earl of Northumberland, is in seeming contrast; the king envies Northumberland “his Harry,” wishing he could claim the gallant Hotspur as his own. Meanwhile, Hal has entered into a quasi-father-son relationship with a disreputable but amusing knight, Sir John Falstaff. Another strand of action centers on still more family relationships. Hotspur’s stand against Henry focuses on Hotspur’s brother-in-law, Mortimer. Mortimer, who fought against the Welsh magician Owen Glendower, was defeated and captured and has married Glendower’s daughter. King Henry pronounces Mortimer a traitor whom he will not ransom.

Henry IV Part Two,,Literary Criticism,"Continuing the saga begun in Henry IV Part I, William Shakespeare's history play Henry IV Part II charts the continuing evolution of Prince Hal from roguish troublemaker to noble ruler of men. This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by Peter Davison with an introduction by Adrian Poole. Angered by the loss of his son in battle, the Earl of Northumberland supports another rebellion against King Henry IV, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Sick and weary, the old King sends out his forces, including the unruly Sir John Falstaff, to meet the rebels. But as the conflict grows, he must also confront a more personal problem - how to make his reprobate son Prince Hal aware of the duties he must bear, as heir to the throne. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare's life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Henry IV Part II, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

Her Smart Escape,,[],"Flying Officer Jayaprakash was caught in a minor fraudulence he was forced to commit to help his senior, Squadron Leader Khanna, to meet the immediate financial requirement. When this was surfaced, a court of inquiry was ordered by the Station Commander and in that Khanna gave statement backing out his role, throwing the entire blame on the shoulders of Jayaprakash. Jayaprakash was blamed in the court of inquiry and was apprehensive of impending court martial throwing him out of service entailing in loss of all service benefits including pension. Visualising the bleak future to fend for his living and education of his children, he was worried and remained morose. His grown-up daughter Riya, studying in twelfth standard, wanted to find ways to extricate her father out of this mess and contacted her friend Maya’s father, Advocate Gupta, a senior lawyer practicing in supreme court. She was advised by Gupta to ask Jayaprakash to visit Khanna’s house with a secret recording pen in his pocket and talk of the impending dangers to his career, making Khanna to admit his involvement in the wrongful payment. As said, she could get the recording done and after hearing the conversation, Gupta assured her all possible help, if a court martial was ordered, to extricate Jayaprakash. On her way back from there, she was kidnapped, thinking her to be the daughter of Gupta, by criminal Surendra Singh, who had given huge sum to the advocate to extricate his elder brother, involved in a murder case, from gallows.

Hiero,Agesilaus ; Constitution of the Lacedaemonians ; Ways and Means ; Cavalry Commander ; Art of Horsemanship ; On Hunting ; Constitution of the Athenians,Electronic books,"Minor works by Xenophon (c. 430-c. 354 BCE) include Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon, on the Spartan system; Ways and Means, on the finances of Athens; a manual of Horsemanship. The Constitution of the Athenians, though not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on Athenian politics. Xenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this ""March Up-Country"" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.",,,,1925.0,,,0674992024,9780674992023,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Q0IAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.94,,,,,,,,,576.0,,,18.0,,,['Xenophon']
Homegoing,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Race', 'Adult Fiction', 'Ghana']","A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, Homegoing heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control.

Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'History', 'Martial Arts', 'Classics', 'Japanese Literature', 'War', 'Religion', 'Asia']","Hagakure (""In the Shadow of Leaves"") is a manual for the samurai classes consisting of a series of short anecdotes and reflections that give both insight and instruction-in the philosophy and code of behavior that foster the true spirit of Bushido-the Way of the Warrior. It is not a book of philosophy as most would understand the word: it is a collection of thoughts and sayings recorded over a period of seven years, and as such covers a wide variety of subjects, often in no particular sequence. The work represents an attitude far removed from our modern pragmatism and materialism, and possesses an intuitive rather than rational appeal in its assertion that Bushido is a Way of Dying, and that only a samurai retainer prepared and willing to die at any moment can be totally true to his lord. While Hagakure was for many years a secret text known only to the warrior vassals of the Hizen fief to which the author belonged, it later came to be recognized as a classic exposition of samurai thought and came to influence many subsequent generations, including Yukio Mishima. This translation offers 300 selections that constitute the core texts of the 1,300 present in the original.

Hipersemiotika: Tafsir Cultural Studies Atas Matinya Makna,,"['Indonesian Literature', 'Cultural Studies', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Cultural']","Buku tentang semiotika ini dimulai dari sebuah definisi semiotika yang dikemukakan oleh Umberto Eco yang mengatakan, bahwa semiotika ""... pada prinsipnya adalah sebuah disiplin yang mempelajari segala sesuatu yang dapat digunakan untuk berdusta (lie)."" Definis Eco ini ꟷmeskipun mungkin sangat mencengangkan banyak orangꟷsecara eksplisit menjelaskan betapa sentralnya konsep dusta di dalam wacana semiotika, sehingga dusta tampaknya menjadi prinsip utama semiotika itu sendiri. Kenapa? Karena, semiotika sebagai satu bentuk representasi pada dasarnya adalah sesuatu yang hadir namun menunjukkan bahwa sesuatu di luar dirinya sendirilah yang coba dia hadirkan. Representasi tidak menunjuk kepada dirinya sendiri, namun kepada orang lain. Karena sifat dasar itulah, maka representasi sering dipermasalahkan ihwal kemampuannya untuk bisa menghadikan ""sesuatu"" di luar dirinya, karena seringkali representasi malah beralih menjadi ""sesuatu"" itu sendiri. Jurang yang terbentuk antara representasi dan yang direpresentasikan ini seringkali terlupakan oleh manusia.

In these three tales, superbly translated by Edward Seidensticker, erotic fantasy is underlaid with longing and memories of past loves.In the title story, the protagonist visits a brothel where elderly men spend a chaste but lecherous night with a drugged, unconscious virgin. As he admires the girl's beauty, he recalls his past womanizing, and reflects on the relentless course of old age. In One Arm, a young girl removes her right arm and gives it to the narrator to take home for the night; a surreal seduction follows as he tries to allay its fears, caresses it, and even replaces his own right arm with it.The protagonist of Of Birds and Beasts prefers the company of his pet birds and dogs to people, yet for him all living beings are beautiful objects which, though they give him pleasure, he treats with casual cruelty.Beautiful yet chilling, richly poetic yet subtly disturbing, these stories make compelling reading and reaffirm Kawabata s status as a world-class writer.",,US,10/30/60,February 6th 2004,"['Eguchi', 'Eguci']",Paperback,,9784770029751,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397139224l/14032.jpg,3.66,[],99.0,1.0,,,,87.0,6305.0,148,Kodansha International,"['1476', '2231', '1795', '584', '219']",,['Japan'],,"['Yasunari Kawabata', 'Edward G.

Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Technology', 'Politics', 'Psychology']","Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.

His Excellency,,Fiction,"His Excellency (French: Son Excellence Eugene Rougon) - From Zola's Rougon-Macquart Series. ""Son Excellence Eugene Rougon is the one existing French novel which gives the reader a fair general idea of what occurred in political spheres at an important period of the Empire. It is a book for foreigners and particularly Englishmen to read with profit, for there are yet many among them who cherish the delusion that Napoleon III. was not only a good and true friend of England, but also a wise and beneficent ruler of France; and this, although his reign began with bloodshed and trickery, was prolonged by means of innume-rable subterfuges, and ended in woe, horror, and disgrace... There is, of course, some fiction in the book; but, again and again, page after page, I have found a simple record of fact, just deftly adapted to suit the requirements of the narrative. The history of the Second Empire is probably as familiar to me as it is to M. Zola himself-for, like him, I grew to manhood in its midst, with better opportunities, too, than he had of observing certain of its distinguishing features - and thus I have been able to identify innumerable incidents and allusions, and trace to their very source some of the most curious passages in the book. And it is for this reason, and by virtue of my own knowledge and experience, that I claim for His Excellency the merit of reflecting things as they really were in the earlier years of the Imperial regime.""
