"H. Beam Piper, Gino D'Achille (Illustrator)",Uller Uprising,,English,,"""ZNIDD SUDDABIT!"" So the Ulleran challenge begins, with the rantings of a prophet and a seemingly incidental street riot. Only when a dose of poison lands in the governor-general's whiskey does it become clear that the ""geeks"" have had it up to their double-lidded eyeballs with the imperialist Terran Federation's Chartered Uller Company. Then, overnight, war is everywhere. How it will end is in the (merely) two Terran hands of the new governor-general, a man shrewd enough to know that ""it is easier to banish a habit of thought than a piece of knowledge."" The problem is, the particular piece of knowledge he needs hasn't been used in 450 years. . . .",Federation,Reprint; U.S. paperback Edition,11/06/52,June 1st 1983,[],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Audiobook', 'Classics']",,9780441842926,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335651526l/1931595.jpg,3.68,[],59.0,1.0,,1931595.Uller_Uprising,,,,,90.0,614.0,201,,Ace,"['141', '208', '202', '51', '12']",,,[],,

The reading continues for about two hours at a stretch. “These readings,” he says, “from Ribhu Gita are as good as Samadhi.” Evidently such a continuous reading (following the meaning intently) induces Samadhi. In fact, page after page, nay after line, of Ribhu Gita merely goes on rubbing into one the Reality of the Self. With a constant study of such works the mind easily gets into the mood of Samadhi.

The journey is triggered by a mysterious package left to Leo by his father, to be opened on his 25th birthday; the package contains an ancient shard of pottery and several documents, suggesting an ancient mystery about the Vincey family. Holly and Leo eventually arrive in eastern Africa where they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen, Ayesha, who reigns as the all-powerful ""She"" or ""She-who-must-be-obeyed"" and who has a mysterious connection to young Leo. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.

To right and left, but a little behind her, like guards attending the person of their sovereign, stood her cousins, the twin brethren, Godwin and Wulf, tall and shapely men. Godwin was still as a statue, his hands folded over the hilt of the long, scabbarded sword, of which the point was set on the ground before him, but Wulf, his brother, moved restlessly, and at length yawned aloud. They were beautiful to look at, all three of them, as they appeared in the splendour of their youth and health. The imperial Rosamund, dark-haired and eyed, ivory skinned and slender-waisted, a posy of marsh flowers in her hand; the pale, stately Godwin, with his dreaming face; and the bold-fronted, blue-eyed warrior, Wulf, Saxon to his finger-tips, notwithstanding his father's Norman blood. At the sound of that unstifled yawn, Rosamund turned her head with the slow grace which marked her every movement.

H.E. Bates,The Darling Buds of May,,English,,"The Darling Buds of May, which came out in 1958, was the first of five Larkin novels and in it readers witness the transformation of Mr. Charlton from a undernourished and timid tax clerk to ‘Charlie’, a fully-converted member of the Larkin way of life: an easygoing celebration of nature, food, drink, and family. In the process, the reader is introduced to the Brigadier, Miss Pilchester, and Angela Snow. Setting the style for the series, the book ends with a grand celebration, and the announcement of the wedding of Charlie and Mariette. The novel was filmed with the title ‘The Mating Game’, and between 1991 and 1993, Yorkshire Television produced a highly-successful television series called ‘The Darling Buds of May’. This first book in the Larkin series was very successful, appearing first in the United States and then in Britain, where it sold 40,000 in the first two months. Many critics felt that Bates deserved better than to be remembered mostly for the Larkin novels, but they were very profitable. The immensely popular Larkin series of comic novels consisted of ‘The Darling Buds of May’, ‘A Breath of French Air’ (1959), ‘When the Green Woods Laugh’ (1960), ‘Oh! To Be in England’ (1963), and ‘A Little of What You Fancy’ (1970). Bates, speaking of how he was inspired to create the Larkins, recalled the real junkyard that he often passed near his home in Kent; and he remembered seeing a family -- a father, mother and many children, sucking at ice-creams and eating crisps in a ""ramshackle lorry that had been recently painted a violent electric blue"". He tried writing a brief tale based on the family, but soon decided that he couldn’t waste such a rich gallery of characters to a short story."" Pop is a wonderful character who hates pomp, pretension and humbug; loves his family, but doesn’t hesitate to break a few rules... and his and the Larkins' secret is “that they live as many of us would like to live if only we had the guts and nerve to flout the conventions.""

H.G. Wells,The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth,,English,,"What happens when science tampers with nature? A riveting, cautionary tale with disastrous results reveals the chilling answer.Hoping to create a new growth agent for food with beneficial uses to mankind, two scientists find that the spread of the material is uncontrollable. Giant chickens, rats, and insects run amok, and children given the food stuffs experience incredible growth--and serious illnesses. Over the years, people who have eaten these specially treated foods find themselves unable to fit into a society where ignorance and hypocrisy rule. These ""giants,"" with their extraordinary mental powers, find themselves shut away from an older, more traditional society. Intolerance and hatred increase as the line of distinction between ordinary people and giants is drawn across communities and families. One of H. G. Wells' lesser-known works, The Food of the Gods has been retold many times in many forms since it was first published in 1904. The gripping, newly relevant tale combines fast-paced entertainment with social commentary as it considers the ethics involved in genetic engineering.",,Dover Value Editions,11/06/04,December 27th 2005,['Albert Caddles'],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels']",,9780486448466,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328863711l/788515.jpg,3.44,[],71.0,1.0,,788515.The_Food_of_the_Gods_and_How_It_Came_to_Earth,,,,,86.0,3868.0,208,,Dover Publications,"['584', '1189', '1538', '461', '96']",,,[],,
H.G. Wells,The Island of Doctor Moreau,,English,,"Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, The Time Machine, not its potential for misuse and terror. In The Island of Dr. Moreau, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.",,,10/28/96,May 1st 1994,"['Dr. Moreau', 'Dr. Montgomery', 'Edward Prendick']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Adventure']",,9780553214321,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388230211l/29981.jpg,3.73,['Locus Award Nominee for Best Illustrated or Art Book (2020)'],1346.0,22.0,,29981.The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau,,,,,92.0,96035.0,153,,Bantam Classics,"['21223', '37149', '29507', '6667', '1489']",,,[],,

"H.G. Wells, Greg Bear (Introduction)",The Last War: A World Set Free,,English,,"From nearly two hundred centres, and every week added to their number, roared the unquenchable crimson conflagrations of the atomic bombs. The flimsy fabric of the world's credit had vanished, industry was completely disorganised, and every city, every thickly populated area was starving or trembled on the verge of starvation. Most of the capital cities of the world were burning; millions of people had already perished, and over great areas government was at an end.The Last War erupts in Europe, rapidly escalating from bloody trench warfare and vicious aerial duels into a world-consuming, atomic holocaust. Paris is engulfed by an atomic maelstrom, Berlin is an ever-flaming crater, the cold waters of the North Sea roar past Dutch dikes and sweep across the Low Countries. Moscow, Chicago, Tokyo, London, and hundreds of other cities become radioactive wastelands. Governments topple, age-old cultural legacies are destroyed, and the stage is set for a new social and political order.The Last War is H.G. Wells's chilling and prophetic tale of a world gone mad with atomic weapons and of the rebirth of humankind from the rubble. Written long before the atomic age, Wells's novel is a riveting and intelligent history of the future that discusses for the first time the horrors of the atomic bomb, offering a startling vision of humanity purged by catastrophic atomic war.",,,11/06/14,March 1st 2001,[],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Literature', 'War', 'Novels', 'Classic Literature', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780803298200,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328818222l/410769.jpg,3.49,[],80.0,1.0,,410769.The_Last_War,,,,,83.0,1302.0,166,,Bison Books,"['258', '393', '432', '165', '54']",,,[],,

Wells’s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century.

Sustained by a steady diet of crabs, cigars, whiskey, and beer, he haunted Baltimore's jails and courtrooms, its churches, theaters, and saloons, and chased fire wagons, interviewed cops and coroners, battled politicians and crusaders, and raced back to the newsroom to beat his deadline by a second or two.",H.

Now, at last, the most important tales of this distinctive American genious are gathered in one volume by National Book Award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates.Combining the nineteenth-century gothic sesibility of Edgar Allan Poe with a daring internal vision, Lovecraft's tales foretold a psychically troubled century to come.  Set in a meticulously described, historically grounded New England landscape, his harrowing stories explore the collapse of sanity beneath the weight of chaotic events.  Lovecraft's universe is a frightening shadow world where reality and nightmare intertwine, and redemption can come only from below.  In her preceptive and penetrating introduction, Oates, herself a virtuoso of the Gothic style, explains how Lovecraft's singular talents fused the supernatural and mundane into a terrifying complex, exquisitely realized vision.",,,10/28/35,September 19th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Gothic', 'Literature', 'Weird Fiction', 'Lovecraftian']",,9780060957902,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1168709833l/36314._SX318_.jpg,4.24,[],6207.0,94.0,,36314.Tales_of_H_P_Lovecraft,,,,,96.0,8852.0,352,,Ecco,"['4135', '3097', '1309', '241', '70']",,,[],,

"H.P. Lovecraft, S.T. Joshi (Editor)",The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories,,English,,"This collection spans Lovecraft’s literary career, and charts the development of his ‘cosmicist’ philosophy; the belief that behind the veil of our blinkered everyday lives lies another reality, too terrible for the human mind to comprehend. In stories written in the gothic tradition, narrators recount their descent into madness and despair. Through their investigations into the unexplained, they tug at the thin threads that separate our world from another of indescribable horror. ‘“ Great God! I never dreamed of THIS!”’ screams occultist Harley Warren in ‘The Statement of Randolph Carter’, as he begs his companion to bury him alive. Another early piece, ‘The Outsider’ – a tragic and emotive evocation of loneliness and desolation – follows a man’s escape from his castle in a desperate search for human contact, but the loathsome truth he discovers destroys his mind.In later tales, such as the iconic ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ and ‘The Whisperer in Darkness’, Lovecraft reaches into the cosmos, bridging the divide between horror and science fiction. The extra-terrestrial ‘gods’ and cursed histories that would emerge from these stories now form the cornerstones of Lovecraft’s unique mythology: the Cthulhu Mythos. This fictional universe, built in large part by his friend and most ardent supporter August Derleth, has in the years since been reimagined in myriad forms, and continues to act as a haunted playground for countless illustrators, fans and authors.This edition, based on its sister limited edition, marries Lovecraft’s best-known fiction with two modern masters of the macabre, the acclaimed artist Dan Hillier and author Alan Moore. In his beautifully crafted new preface, Moore finds Lovecraft at once at odds with and integral to the time in which he lived: ‘the improbable embodiment of an estranged world in transition’. Yet, despite his prejudices and parochialisms, he ‘possessed a voice and a perspective both unique in modern literature’.Hillier’s six mesmerising, portal-like illustrations embrace the alien realities that lurk among the gambrel roofs of Lovecraft’s landscapes. By splicing Victorian portraits and lithographs with cosmic and Lovecraftian symbolism, each piece – like the stories themselves – pulls apart the familiar to reveal what lies beneath.The edition itself shimmers with Lovecraft’s ‘unknown colours’, bound in purple and greens akin to both the ocean depths and mysteries from outer space. The cover is embossed with a mystical design by Hillier, while a monstrous eye stares blankly from the slipcase.Content:1. Dagon2. The Statement of Randolph Carter3.

H.W. Brands,The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,,English,,"National Bestseller He was the foremost American of his day, yet today he is little more than a mythic caricature in the public imagination. Benjamin Franklin, perhaps the pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this masterly biography.Wit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin was in every respect America’s first Renaissance man. From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America’s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world’s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant. Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius. A much needed reminder of Franklin’s greatness and humanity, The First American is a work of meticulous scholarship that provides a magnificent tour of a legendary historical figure, a vital era in American life, and the countless arenas in which the protean Franklin left his legacy.",,,09/19/00,March 12th 2002,['Benjamin Franklin'],Paperback,"['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'American Revolution', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'American', 'Historical', 'American Revolutionary War']",,9780385495400,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320438405l/147602.jpg,4.09,['Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award Nominee (2001)'],95.0,1.0,,147602.The_First_American,,,,,93.0,19394.0,765,,Anchor Books,"['8163', '6721', '3121', '852', '537']",,,[],,

Ha Jin,Waiting,,English,,"In Waiting, PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author Ha Jin draws on his intimate knowledge of contemporary China to create a novel of unexpected richness and feeling. This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through the political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and stifle the promptings of his innermost heart.For more than seventeen years, this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever, modern woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village lives the wife his family chose for him when he was young--a humble and touchingly loyal woman, whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In a culture in which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and where adultery discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate love is stretched ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom.

Ha-Joon Chang,Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism,,English,,"A rising young star in the field of economics attacks the free-trade orthodoxy of The World Is Flat head-on—a crisp, contrarian history of global capitalism.One economist has called Ha-Joon Chang ""the most exciting thinker our profession has turned out in the past fifteen years."" With Bad Samaritans, this provocative scholar bursts into the debate on globalization and economic justice. Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the ""World Is Flat"" orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, today's economic superpowers—from the U.S. to Britain to his native Korea—all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade and—via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization—ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.Unlike typical economists who construct models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as sacrosanct—but developed our own industries by studiously copying others' technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growth—but many developing countries had higher GDP growth before they were pressured into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are struggling to follow in our footsteps.",,,July 5th 2007,December 26th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Finance', 'International Relations', 'Political Science', 'Money', 'Audiobook']",,9781596913998,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312041078l/1032019.jpg,4.18,[],17.0,1.0,,1032019.Bad_Samaritans,,,,,96.0,4235.0,288,,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,"['1791', '1658', '606', '136', '44']",,,[],,
Ha-Joon Chang,23 Things They Don't Tell You about Capitalism,,English,,"Thing 1: There is no such thing as free market. Thing 4: The washing machine has changed the world more than the Internet. Thing 5: Assume the worst about people, and you get the worst. Thing 13: Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer.If you've wondered how we did not see the economic collapse coming, Ha-Joon Chang knows the answer: We didn't ask what they didn't tell us about capitalism. This is a lighthearted book with a serious purpose: to question the assumptions behind the dogma and sheer hype that the dominant school of neoliberal economists-the apostles of the freemarket-have spun since the Age of Reagan.Chang, the author of the international bestseller Bad Samaritans, is one of the world's most respected economists, a voice of sanity-and wit-in the tradition of John Kenneth Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz. 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism equips readers with an understanding of how global capitalism works-and doesn't. In his final chapter, ""How to Rebuild the World,"" Chang offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends, instead of becoming slaves of the market.Ha-Joon Chang teaches in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge. His books include the bestselling Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism.

Growing up in an abusive home put Van on the fast track to nowhere, but a caring fight club owner took him under his wing as a teen and shaped him into a fighter with integrity. Now in his mid-twenties, his life changes dramatically when he steps in to help a beautiful girl in a scary situation with her boyfriend. Surprising to Van, she ends up going home with him. He's now on the fast track to something else: falling in love. He feels that Danielle is the type of girl men only dream about, but the two quickly fall hard for each other in equal measure.When the ex boyfriend proves to be nothing but trouble, Van has a tough time deciding between protecting Dani with legal measures or just bashing the guy's face in himself. The harassment escalates, eventually pulling Dani and Van apart, and Van finds himself feeling desperate enough to do something drastic.If being thrown in jail isn't bad enough for Van, an undercover investigator seems to be getting a little too close to Dani, the fight club he grew up in could be turned upside down with scandal, and the friends that he trusts with his life might not be who they say they are.So much for finally discovering the little morsel of happiness he'd been deprived of his entire life...",The Fighter's Block #1,,,November 17th 2012,[],Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Fighters', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Sports', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Erotica', 'Mixed Martial Arts', 'Suspense', 'Abuse']",,B00A9H95JQ,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353550197l/16164246.jpg,3.81,[],23.0,1.0,,16164246-the-fighter-s-block,,,,,89.0,1799.0,332,,,"['526', '685', '391', '117', '80']",,,[],,

Hafez,The Divan,,English,,"The Persian poet Hafez (1320-1389) is best known as a Sufi mystic who incorporated elements of Sufism into his verses. The state of God-Realisation is symbolised through union with a Beloved, and drinking the wine of spiritual love.This compact version of the Divan of Hafez is a facsimile illuminated manuscript, complete with beautiful Persian calligraphy and miniature illustrations. There are 43 ghazals, translated into English by classical scholar Gertrude Bell. It is a truly beautiful introduction not only to the works of this beloved Sufi mystic, but also to the artistry of Mahmoud Farshchian. It is like getting two books in one: poetry and art.""Hafiz has no peer."" — GoethePoetry is the greatest literary form of ancient Persia and modern Iran, and the fourteenth-century poet known as Hafiz is its preeminent master. Little is known about the poet's life, and there are more legends than facts relating to the particulars of his existence. This mythic quality is entirely appropriate for the man known as ""The Interpreter of Mysteries"" and ""The Tongue of the Hidden,"" whose verse is regarded as oracular by those seeking guidance and attempting to realize wishes.A mere fraction of what is presumed to have been an extensive body of work survives. This collection is derived from Hafiz's Divan (collected poems), a classic of Sufism. The short poems, called ghazals, are sonnet-like arrangements of varied numbers of couplets. In the tradition of Persian poetry and Sufi philosophy, each poem corresponds to two interpretations, sensual and mystic.This outstanding translation of Hafiz's poetry was created by historian and Arabic scholar Gertrude Bell, who observed, ""These are the utterances of a great poet, the imaginative interpreter of the heart of man; they are not of one age, or of another, but for all time.""",,,10/28/98,2003,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Iran', 'Literature', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Islam', 'Philosophy', '14th Century', 'Mysticism']",,9789646534780,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327770153l/46292.jpg,4.63,[],574.0,7.0,,46292.The_Divan,,,,,97.0,7386.0,566,,جیحون,"['5677', '1042', '437', '131', '99']",,,"['Persia', 'Iran, Islamic Republic of']",,

Hafsah Faizal (Goodreads Author),We Hunt the Flame,,English,,"People lived because she killed.People died because he lived.Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the king. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. Both are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya—but neither wants to be.War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the king on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds—and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine.Set in a richly detailed world inspired by ancient Arabia, We Hunt the Flame is a gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.

We can’t escape this explosion of digital information and few of us want to–the benefits are too seductive. The technology has enabled unprecedented innovation, collaboration, entertainment, and democratic participation. But the same engineering marvels are shattering centuries-old assumptions about privacy, identity, free expression, and personal control as more and more details of our lives are captured as digital data.Can you control who sees all that personal information about you? Can email be truly confidential, when nothing seems to be private? Shouldn’t the Internet be censored the way radio and TV are? Is it really a federal crime to download music? When you use Google or Yahoo! to search for something, how do they decide which sites to show you? Do you still have free speech in the digital world? Do you have a voice in shaping government or corporate policies about any of this?Blown to Bits offers provocative answers to these questions and tells intriguing real-life stories.

Yet not even Bashir’s degree could protect her from the encroaching conflict that would consume her homeland. Janjaweed Arab militias savagely assaulted the Zaghawa, often with the backing of the Sudanese military. Then, in early 2004, the Janjaweed attacked Bashir’s village and surrounding areas, raping forty-two schoolgirls and their teachers. Bashir, who treated the traumatized victims, some as young as eight years old, could no longer remain quiet. But breaking her silence ignited a horrifying turn of events.Raw and riveting, Tears of the Desert is the first memoir ever written by a woman caught up in the war in Darfur.

Halinka Panzera (Goodreads Author),What’s that Super Model Doing in my Workplace?,,English,,"In What's that Super Model doing in My Workplace?, author Halinka Panzera explains why now given Globalisation and faltering economies we need to seek leaders with different characteristics. Social and economic change means that business behaviour needs to adapt. A profit-only, homogeneous male-dominated, institutionalised, single-minded approach to business will no longer secure business success in the future. We are already seeing decline in corporate performance among companies that are adhering to older models. A more broad-minded, balanced outlook that incorporates wider societal characteristics and priorities is needed. An organisation needs to develop a wide range of solutions to any given problem. Says Halinka Panzera, ""When organisations try to replicate the type of leadership they have had in the past, they don't maximise their problem solving. This 'dinosaur' style has had its day"". The Super Model has been created by research insights and provides a new approach for problem solving for CEO's, HR, Management, and new Leaders.

And if Bjartur of Summerhouses, the book's protagonist, is an ordinary sheep farmer, his flinty determination to achieve independence is genuinely heroic and, at the same time, terrifying and bleakly comic.Having spent eighteen years in humiliating servitude, Bjartur wants nothing more than to raise his flocks unbeholden to any man.

At the close of the 17th century, Iceland is an oppressed Danish colony, suffering from extreme poverty, famine, and plague. A farmer and accused cord-thief named Jon Hreggvidsson makes an improper joke about the Danish king and soon after finds himself a fugitive charged with the murder of the king’s hangman.In the years that follow, the hapless but resilient rogue Hreggvidsson becomes a pawn entangled in political and personal conflicts playing out on a far grander scale. Chief among these is the star-crossed love affair between Snaefridur, known as “Iceland’s Sun,” a beautiful, headstrong young noblewoman, and Arnas Arnaeus, the king’s antiquarian, an aristocrat whose worldly manner conceals a fierce devotion to his downtrodden countrymen.

They came from Fleet Street, Knightsbridge, Wolverhampton, Sweden and Wales. They wrote ballads, ran coffee houses, lived on country estates, they breathed ink-dust from printing presses and escaped people-traffickers. What they had in common was the year of their murders: 1888. The person responsible was never identified, but the character created by the press to fill that gap has become far more famous than any of these five women.For more than a century, newspapers have been keen to tell us that ‘the Ripper’ preyed on prostitutes. Not only is this untrue, as historian Hallie Rubenhold has discovered, it has prevented the real stories of these fascinating women from being told. Now, in this devastating narrative of five lives, Rubenhold finally sets the record straight, revealing a world not just of Dickens and Queen Victoria, but of poverty, homelessness and rampant misogyny.

And as her passive rebellion manifests in ever more extreme and frightening forms, scandal, abuse, and estrangement begin to send Yeong-hye spiraling deep into the spaces of her fantasy. In a complete metamorphosis of both mind and body, her now dangerous endeavor will take Yeong-hye—impossibly, ecstatically, tragically—far from her once-known self altogether.",,,10/30/07,February 2nd 2016,"['Kim Yeong-hye', 'Kim In-hye']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia', 'Horror', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Asian Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478196580l/25489025.jpg,3.58,"['Internationaler Literaturpreis – Haus der Kulturen der Welt Nominee for Ki-Hyang Lee (2017)', 'PEN Translation Prize Nominee for Deborah Smith (2017)', 'Frankfurt Book Fair LiBeraturpreis Nominee (2017)', 'International Booker Prize (2016)']",657.0,7.0,,25489025-the-vegetarian,,,,,87.0,92615.0,188,,Hogarth Press,"['16649', '35484', '28516', '9277', '2689']",,,"['Seoul, South Korea (Korea, Republic of)']",,

"Haneef James Oliver, Mislyn Nelson (Editor)",The 'Wahhabi Myth': Dispelling Prevalent Fallacies and the Fictitious link with Bin Laden,,,,"The 'Wahhabi' Myth by Haneef James Oliver clarifies many of the gross inaccuracies and outright lies that have been attributed to the belief of the Salafi Muslims (often referred to as ""Wahhabis""). Although some reporters have been vigilant enough to rebut some of these widespread fables, most have fallen headfirst into what one discerning reporter called, ""the neo-conservative line that the whole conspiracy against America can be traced back to Wahhabism and the government of Saudi Arabia.""Oliver outlines the principles of the Salafi creed in an easy to understand manner. Using many different sources, he carefully presents the arguments of the critics of Salafism and successfully addresses the misconceptions contained within these criticisms. Specifically, he addresses the commonly-held belief that Osama Bin Laden is a Salafi/'Wahhabi.' He compellingly dispels this myth and unveils the sect that has provoked Bin Laden to become the leader of a terrorist movement, something that the media has failed to do.Accordingly, it is expected that the ""Wahhabi Myth could have a profound effect upon people's understanding of current affairs.

Hanif Kureishi,Intimacy,,German,,"Hanif Kureishi's fourth novel made many reviewers uneasy on its first appearance in the U.K., because it cuts so painfully near to the bone. If a novelist's first duty is to tell the truth, then the author has done his duty with unflinching courage. Intimacy gives us the thoughts and memories of a middle-aged writer on the night before he walks out on his wife and two young sons for of a younger woman. A very modern man, without political convictions or religious beliefs, he vaguely hopes to find fulfillment in sexual love. No one is spared Kureishi's cold, penetrating gaze or lacerating pen. ""She thinks she's feminist, but she's just bad-tempered,"" the unnamed narrator says of his abandoned wife. A male friend advises him, ""Marriage is a battle, a terrible journey, a season in hell, and a reason for living."" At the heart of Intimacy is this terrible paradox: ""You don't stop loving someone just because you hate them."" Male readers will wince with recognition at the narrator's hatred of entrapment and domesticity, and his implacable urge towards freedom, escape, even loneliness. Female readers may find it a truly horrific revelation. Kureishi is only telling it like it is, in staccato sentences of pinpoint accuracy.

A normal family in many ways, the Rovaniemis struggle with sibling rivalry, parental expectations, and forming their own unique identities in such a large family. But when two of the children venture from the faith, the family fragments and a haunting question emerges: Do we believe for ourselves, or for each other? Each chapter is told from the distinctive point of view of a different Rovaniemi, drawing a nuanced, kaleidoscopic portrait of this unconventional family. The children who reject the church learn that freedom comes at the almost unbearable price of their close family ties, and those who stay struggle daily with the challenges of resisting the temptations of modern culture.

"Hannah Crafts, Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Editor)",The Bondwoman's Narrative,,English,,"The Barnes Noble Review Through a sequence of fortuitous events detailed in the introduction, noted scholar and author Henry Louis Gates Jr. has discovered what he and others believe may be the first novel written by an African-American woman -- a discovery made even more monumental by the fact that it was found in its original manuscript form, completely unedited. Extensive scientific testing has been completed to authenticate the manuscript and ascertain its origins, and experts agree that it was written between 1853 and 1859, by an African-American woman who had previously been enslaved. Gates has painstakingly sought to identify the author, Hannah Crafts, through historical research, and although he has been unsuccessful in determining her true identity, he has found that many of the places, dates, and characters in the novel can be linked reliably to real events and people.A riveting story about a young slave woman on a Southern plantation, The Bondwoman's Narrative follows the title character as she escapes and makes her way to freedom. As a novel, it possesses all the charms and devices of popular mid-19th-century fiction, and the influences of gothic and romantic writers popular in the day are apparent throughout the text. But Crafts accomplishes more than mere mimicry in her book, adding her own voice to established traditions to create a unique style.Throughout the 19th century, many slave narratives -- most notably The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass -- detailed the daily horrors of slavery. In choosing to write a novel rather than an autobiographical narrative, however, Crafts expresses the complete psychological and emotional breadth of the experience, transcending personal, private tortures to illuminate the inhumanity of ""the peculiar institution."" Her characters reflect upon and feel the experience of enslavement -- and because they are wholly rounded and fully developed, they also express the intellect and insight present in the best writings of Dickens, Poe, or Thoreau.Discovered dallying in her master's portrait gallery by a white housekeeper, who comments that she is ""[l]ooking at the pictures...as if such an ignorant thing as you would know any thing about them,"" the title character poignantly counters to herself, ""Ignorance, forsooth. Can ignorance quench the immortal mind or prevent its feeling at times the indications of its heavenly origins? Can it destroy that deep abiding appreciation of the beautiful that seems inherent to the human soul? Can it seal up the fountains of truth and all intuitive perception of life, death, and eternity? I think not. Those to whom man teaches little, nature like a wise and prudent mother teaches much.""Regardless of its historical importance -- and the unavoidable questions and controversies about its authenticity -- the literary merits of The Bondwoman's Narrative are clear. A deeply engaging novel told with the clarity of a woman who has endured slavery's sorrows and the creativity of one who, at her core, was a gifted artist, it is a powerful story that leaves the reader simultaneously bereft and exhilarated, one that bears witness to the transcendent power of art.

Hannah Hart,"My Drunk Kitchen: A Guide to Eating, Drinking, and Going with Your Gut",,,,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLEROne day, sad cubicle dweller and otherwise bored New York transplant Hannah Hart decided, as a joke, to make a fake cooking show for her friend back in California. She turned on the camera, pulled out some bread and cheese, and then, as one does, started drinking. (Doesn't everyone cook with a spoon in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other?) The video went viral and an online sensation was born.My Drunk Kitchen includes recipes, stories, full color photos, and drawings to inspire your own culinary adventures in tipsy cooking. It is also a showcase for Hannah Hart's great comedic voice. Hannah offers key drink recommendations, cooking tips (like, remember to turn the oven off when you go to bed) and shares never-before-seen recipes such as:The Hartwich (Knowledge is ingenuity! Learn from the past!)Can Bake (Inventing things is hard! You don't have to start from scratch!)Latke Shotkas (Plan ahead to avoid a night of dread!)Tiny Sandwiches (Size doesn't matter! Aim to satisfy.)Saltine Nachos (It's not about resources! It's about being resourceful.)This is a book for anyone who believes they have what it takes to make a soufflé for the holiday party and show up the person who apparently has nothing better to do than bake things from scratch. It also recommends the drink you'll need to accompany any endeavor of this magnitude. In the end, My Drunk Kitchen may not be your go-to guide for your next dinner party . . . but it will make you laugh and drink . . .

Hannu Rajaniemi,The Quantum Thief,,English,,"Jean le Flambeur gets up in the morning and has to kill himself before his other self can kill him first. Just another day in the Dilemma Prison. Rescued by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean is taken to the Oubliette, the Moving City of Mars, where time is a currency, memories are treasures, and a moon-turned-singularity lights the night. Meanwhile, investigator Isidore Beautrelet, called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur...Indeed, in his many lives, the entity called Jean le Flambeur has been a thief, a confidence artist, a posthuman mind-burgler, and more. His origins are shrouded in mystery, but his deeds are known throughout the Heterarchy, from breaking into the vast Zeusbrains of the Inner System to stealing rare Earth antiques from the aristocrats of Mars. In his last exploit, he managed the supreme feat of hiding the truth about himself from the one person in the solar system hardest to hide from: himself. Now he has the chance to regain himself in all his power—in exchange for finishing the one heist he never quite managed.The Quantum Thief is a breathtaking joyride through the solar system several centuries hence, a world of marching cities, ubiquitous public-key encryption, people who communicate via shared memory, and a race of hyper-advanced humans who originated as an MMORPG guild. But for all its wonders, The Quantum Thief is also a story powered by very human motives of betrayal, jealousy, and revenge.",Jean le Flambeur #1,,,September 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Mystery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space', 'Audiobook']",,9780575088870,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327950631l/7562764.jpg,3.83,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best First Novel (2011)', 'John W.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories - called eventyrs, or ""fantastic tales"" - express themes that transcend age and nationality.During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature listeners/readers as well. They have inspired motion pictures, plays, ballets, and animated films.RUNNING TIME ⇒ 5hrs. and 59mins.Public Domain (P)2020 AL Studio",Andersen Masalları #3,,10/28/13,January 1996,[],Hardcover,"['Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Fairy Tales', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Mythology', 'Folklore', 'Young Adult']",,9780517092910,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385233181l/46306.jpg,4.28,[],4791.0,82.0,,46306.The_Complete_Fairy_Tales,,,,,97.0,116114.0,803,,Gramercy Books,"['58009', '36846', '17629', '2731', '899']",,,[],,

Hans Holbein,The Dance of Death,,English,,"Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543), remembered today for his insightful portraits, was better known in his own time for his varied and extensive graphic works, the most celebrated of which was The Dance of Death. This work, from the woodblocks of collaborator Hans Lützelburger, was first published in book form in 1538.The theme of the dance of death was a popular one of the sixteenth century. Holbein captured the feeling of death, the leveler, in its attack on all classes, both sexes, and all ages. A stylized skeleton seizes the child from his mother's breast. The skeleton snatches, plays, tugs, and cavorts throughout the rest of the book. The king, emperor, pope, and cardinal must cease from their functions. The skull is thrust into the face of the astrologer. The hourglass runs out onto the floor. Countess, nun, sailor, peddler, senator are all stopped by the common force. Forty-one finely cut, highly detailed woodcuts capture the single motif, Memento mori: ""Remember, you will die."" Although the theme is common, the variety of expressions, social groups, backgrounds, styles of dress and architecture, and calls to death are so varied that each one is unique in its power.This edition, reprinting the unabridged 1538 edition, is the first in a series reprinting great rare books from the Rosenwald Collection. Besides the woodcuts, the book contains a prefatory letter by Jean de Vauzéle and various quotations, depictions, and meditations on death, deaths of men, and the necessity of death. A repeated series of the 41 woodblocks follows the reprinted work and contains English translations of the quotations and verses. Art historians and social historians will find this to be one of the best depictions of class life caught at its fateful moment.

When asked simple questions about global trends - why the world's population is increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers.In Factfulness, Professor of International Health and a man who can make data sing, Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators Anna and Ola, offers a radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveals the ten instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most. 
  Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world.

Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.",,First Edition,,March 10th 2015,"['Jude St. Francis', 'Willem Ragnarsson', 'Malcom Irvine', 'Jean-Baptiste (JB) Marion', 'Harold Stein', 'Julia Altman', 'Andy Contractor', 'Richard Goldfarb', 'Ana']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Literature']",,9780385539258,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446469353l/22822858._SY475_.jpg,4.31,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2015)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2016)"", 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (Shortlist) (2016)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2015)', 'Kirkus Prize for Fiction (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2015)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2015)', 'Jarl Hellemann -palkinto (2017)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2017)']",6875.0,72.0,,22822858-a-little-life,,,,,93.0,211560.0,720,,Doubleday,"['122769', '52252', '21553', '9093', '5893']",,,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'SoHo, New York City, New York (United States)']",,

Lietuvių kalba išleisti romanai „Šimtas metų vienatvės“, „Patriarcho ruduo“, „Meilė choleros metu“, „Apie meilę ir kitus demonus“, „Prisiminimai apie mano liūdnąsias kekšes“, prisiminimų knyga „Gyvenk taip, kad turėtum ką papasakoti“.Haroldas Irnbergeris išsamiai pasakoja apie šio kolumbiečių autoriaus gyvenimą ir kūrybą nuo vaikystės Arakatakoje ir iki pat šių dienų. Skaitytojui atsiveria kita, žmogiškoji Gabrielio Garsijos Markeso gyvenimo pusė, jo interesai, pažiūros ir pilietinė pozicija, kaip ir nepažįstamas Lotynų Amerikos rašytojo pasaulis.„Vulkanas, spjaudantis svajonėmis,“ – taip pasakė Pablas Neruda apie Gabrielį Garsiją Markesą. Sužavėtas jo romanų turtingumo ir beribės fantazijos, skaitai Nobelio premijos laureato kūrinius kaip nepakartojamą magiškojo realizmo pavyzdį. Tačiau jo draugas kolumbietis pažymi: „Susidaro įspūdis, kad europiečiai skaitytojai dažniausiai atkreipia dėmesį į tavo pasakojamų dalykų magiją, tačiau nemato tikrovės, iš kurios ji kyla...“Šioje įdomiai papasakotoje biografijoje su didele pagarba, kurios rašytojas tikrai nusipelnė savo gyvenimu ir kūryba, biografas pirmiausiai piešia Gabrielio Garsijos Markeso, kaip įtakingos figūros Lotynų Amerikos gyvenime, portretą.",,,11/06/03,2008,[],Hardcover,[],,9789955249214,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385758427l/19049712.jpg,3.88,[],86.0,1.0,,19049712-gabrielis-garsija-markesas-tikrov-s-magija,,,,,100.0,8.0,326,,Alma littera,"['2', '3', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

As Myron is drawn into the case—along with a dirty U.S. senator, a jealous mother, and the mob—he finds himself caught between a killer and the truth.",Myron Bolitar #2,,,February 5th 1996,"['Myron Bolitar', 'Duane Richwood', 'Valerie Simpson', 'Jessica Culver', 'Esperanza Diaz', 'Windsor ""Win"" Horne Lockwood, III']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Audiobook', 'Sports', 'Detective', 'Adult']",,9780440220459,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442497652l/43932._SY475_.jpg,3.94,[],82.0,1.0,,43932.Drop_Shot,,,,,97.0,28107.0,341,,Dell Publishing Company,"['7275', '12937', '6956', '818', '121']",,,"['Bethesda, Maryland (United States)']",,
Harlan Ellison,The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World,,English,,"""It crouches near the center of creation. There is no night where it waits. Only the riddle of which terrible dream will set it loose. It beheaded mercy to take possession of that place. It feasts on darkness from the minds of men. No one has ever seen its eyeless face. When it sleeps we know a few moments of peace. But when it breathes again we go down in fire and mate with jackals. It knows our fear. It has our number. It waited for our coming and it will abide long after we have become congealed smoke. It has never heard music, and shows its fangs when we panic. It is the beast of our savage past, hungering today, and waiting patiently for the mortal meal of all our golden tomorrows. It lies waiting.""--Harlan Ellison15 stories by Harlan EllisonContents ""Introduction: The Waves in Rio"" ""The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"" ""Along the Scenic Route"" ""Phoenix"" ""Asleep: With Still Hands"" ""Santa Claus vs. S.P.I.D.E.R.""

Harlan Ellison,Deathbird Stories,,English,,"Harlan Ellison's masterwork of myth and terror as he seduces all innocence on a mind-freezing odyssey into the darkest reaches of mortal terror and the most dazzling heights of Olympian hell in his finest collection.Deathbird Stories is a collection of 19 of Harlan Ellison's best stories, including Edgar and Hugo winners, originally published between 1960 and 1974. The collection contains some of Ellison's best stories from earlier collections and is judged by some to be his most consistently high quality collection of short fiction. The theme of the collection can be loosely defined as God, or Gods. Sometimes they're dead or dying, some of them are as brand-new as today's technology. Unlike some of Ellison's collections, the introductory notes to each story can be as short as a phrase and rarely run more than a sentence or two. One story took a Locus Poll Award, the two final ones both garnered Hugo Awards and Locus Poll awards, and the final one also received a Jupiter Award from the Instructors of Science Fiction in Higher Education (discontinued in 1979).

"Harlan Ellison, Richard Delap (Editor), Terry Dowling (Editor), Gil Lamont (Editor)",The Essential Ellison: A 35-Year Retrospective,,English,,"In Egyptian mythology, Iai is th rebel, the tester, the stubborn resisting force of intellect and insight which donkey-like stands its ground, refusing to budge, and challenges what is accepted and valued and thought to be sensible and true. This book is a portrait of one artist as sublime Rebel. Fortunately, it doesnt have to be a ""Best of"" collection (though it does contain much of his finest work). Rather, it is a sound representation, ""warts and all,"" of the writing of someone who is perfectly, vigorously, cast as the Iai of his age. Though Harlan's work is widely known and applauded, not enough is made of the sense of social responsibility that is central to it. In fact, this dimension often seems to be deliberately overlooked and the major thrust of his fantasy trivialized. He deals in ideas, sometimes so full of love and compassion that they stun with their simple honesty; sometimes set with barbs and hooks that catch and tear and make us gasp and make us feel. Dr. Johnson would have been proud. Shakespeare would have smiled fondly. Because that's the dimension of achievement occurring here.

Car pool, bath time, soccer practice, homework, dinner hour, and sleepovers all become more than just hurdles to overcome to get through the day. They are opportunities for intimate and meaningful time with young kids. It's not how much time you have with your kids, but how you spend that time that matters in the life and legacy of a young family. No Regrets Parenting helps parents find the time to do it all and feel good about their kids' childhood.There is a simple, single truth for every parent. Your kids need you to be there. They need to see who you are and how you live your life. And, in return, they will help you to better see who you are and how you should be living your life. No Regrets Parenting is about time.

To American readers Unger's biography will provide a stark reminder of just how near run a thing was our War of Independence and the degree to which our forefathers' victory hinged on the help of our French allies, marshalled for George Washington by his 'adopted' son, Lafayette. But even more absorbing and much less well known to the general reader will be Unger's account of Lafayette's idealistic but naive efforts to plant the fruits of the American democracy he so admired in the unreceptive soil of his homeland.

But mostly this story happened in Corinth, a town of the middle class in a Middle Western state. There is nothing peculiar about Corinth. The story might have happened just as well in any other place, for the only distinguishing feature about this town is its utter lack of any distinguishing feature whatever. In all the essential elements of its life, so far as this story goes, Corinth is exactly like every other village, town or city in the land. This, indeed, is why the story happened in this particular place.",,,10/30/09,July 1st 2004,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Christianity', 'Historical Fiction']",,9780809587636,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348716562l/953256.jpg,4.15,[],146.0,2.0,,953256.The_Calling_of_Dan_Matthews,,,,,97.0,281.0,,,Wildside Press,"['114', '106', '52', '7', '2']",,,[],,
Harold Bell Wright,The Shepherd of the Hills,,English,,"""Here and there among men, there are those who pause in the hurried rush to listen to the call of a life that is more real. He who sees too much is cursed for a dreamer, a fanatic, or a fool, by the mad mob, who, having eyes, see not, ears and hear not, and refuse to understand.""--From The Shepherd of the HillsOriginally published in 1907, The Shepherd of the Hills is Harold Bell Wright's most famous work. Pelican Publishing Company is honored to bring this classic novel back to print as part of the Pelican Pouch series. In The Shepherd of the Hills, Wright spins a tale of universal truths across the years to the modern-day reader. His Eden in the Ozarks has a bountiful share of life's enchantments, but is not without its serpents. While Wright rejoices in the triumphs, grace, and dignity of his characters, he has not naively created a pastoral fantasyland where the pure at heart are spared life's struggles and pains. Refusing to yield to the oft-indulged temptation of painting for the reader the simple life of country innocents, Wright forthrightly shows the passions and the life-and-death struggles that go on even in the fairest of environments that man invades. The shepherd, an elderly, mysterious, learned man, escapes the buzzing restlessness of the city to live in the backwoods neighborhood of Mutton Hollow in the Ozark hills. There he encounters Jim Lane, Grant Matthews, Sammy, Young Matt, and other residents of the village, and gradually learns to find a peace about the losses he has borne and has yet to bear. Through the shepherd and those around him, Wright assembles here a gentle and utterly masterful commentary on strength and weakness, failure and success, tranquility and turmoil, and punishment and absolution. This tale of life in the Ozarks continues to draw thousands of devotees to outdoor performances in Branson, Missouri, where visitors can also see the cabin where the real Old Matt and Aunt Mollie lived.Harold Bell Wright also is the author of That Printer of Udell's (pb) and The Calling of Dan Matthews (pb), both published by Pelican.",,,10/28/07,February 29th 1992,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Historical', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Novels']",,9780882898841,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348930036l/1043521.jpg,4.19,[],658.0,8.0,,1043521.The_Shepherd_of_the_Hills,,,,,95.0,2478.0,304,,Pelican,"['1119', '846', '397', '87', '29']",,,[],,

Harold Bloom,"Ernest Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms""",,,,"As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with A Farewell to Arms. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fiancé of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits:  I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.  The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he ""did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards."" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.  Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and A Farewell to Arms, like his other novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Sun Also Rises, and To Have and Have Not), offers neither. What it does provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. --Alix Wilber",Bloom's Notes,,10/06/85,October 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,[],,9781604135725,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348391303l/6962816.jpg,3.8,[],90.0,1.0,,6962816-ernest-hemingway-s-a-farewell-to-arms,,,,,92.0,61.0,128,,Chelsea House Publishers,"['15', '24', '17', '5', '0']",,,[],,

The Commandant's choice for 1993 was We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young. In November 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, were dropped by helicopter into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. How these men persevered--sacrificed themselves for their comrades and never gave up--makes a vivid portrait of war at its most inspiring and devastating. General Moore and Joseph Galloway, the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, have interviewed hundreds of men who fought there, including the North Vietnamese commanders. This devastating account rises above the specific ordeal it chronicles to present a picture of men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have found unimaginable only a few hours earlier.

Harold Keith,Rifles for Watie,,English,,"Jeff Bussey walked briskly up the rutted wagon road toward Fort Leavenworth on his way to join the Union volunteers. It was 1861 in Linn County, Kansas, and Jeff was elated at the prospect of fighting for the North at last.In the Indian country south of Kansas there was dread in the air; and the name, Stand Watie, was on every tongue. A hero to the rebel, a devil to the Union man, Stand Watie led the Cherokee Indian Nation fearlessly and successfully on savage raids behind the Union lines. Jeff came to know the Watie men only too well.He was probably the only soldier in the West to see the Civil War from both sides and live to tell about it. Amid the roar of cannon and the swish of flying grape, Jeff learned what it meant to fight in battle. He learned how it felt never to have enough to eat, to forage for his food or starve. He saw the green fields of Kansas and Okla-homa laid waste by Watie's raiding parties, homes gutted, precious corn deliberately uprooted. He marched endlessly across parched, hot land, through mud and slashing rain, always hungry, always dirty and dog-tired.And, Jeff, plain-spoken and honest, made friends and enemies. The friends were strong men like Noah Babbitt, the itinerant printer who once walked from Topeka to Galveston to see the magnolias in bloom; boys like Jimmy Lear, too young to carry a gun but old enough to give up his life at Cane Hill; ugly, big-eared Heifer, who made the best sourdough biscuits in the Choctaw country; and beautiful Lucy Washbourne, rebel to the marrow and proud of it. The enemies were men of another breed - hard-bitten Captain Clardy for one, a cruel officer with hatred for Jeff in his eyes and a dark secret on his soul.This is a rich and sweeping novel-rich in its panorama of history; in its details so clear that the reader never doubts for a moment that he is there; in its dozens of different people, each one fully realized and wholly recognizable.

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive.

The Adventurers is a story of revolution and danger in the sultry jungles of South America.As a young boy, Diogenes Alejandro Xenos (“Dax”) witnesses the brutal rape and murder of his mother and sister by government troops—experiencing the drama of revolution, loss, and tragedy firsthand. He is sent to Europe by the victorious rebel leader to rebuild his country’s diplomatic and financial status post-revolution, and is immediately thrown into the elite environment of Europe’s jet set society of international bankers and diplomats.Outwardly, Dax lives a life of privilege as one of the continent’s most sought-after, hedonistic playboys—wanted by men and women alike, but for very different reasons. Inside, however, he channels his fear, anger and hatred for the new regime, which he realizes is as corrupt as the old, into a desire to disrupt the status quo. Once a favorite of the general-turned-dictator, Dax quickly becomes an outlaw in his own country, living on the fringes of society as a rebel hell-bent on a new revolution.This epic tale of escape from the horrors of a third world regime is one of Harold Robbins' most ambitious novels ever, combining his trademark sensuality with political intrigue, a globe-spanning variety of exotic locales, and themes that never seem to change—political intrigue, greed, power, money, violence, sex and betrayal.With Dax Xenos, Robbins thrills and excites us with one of his most memorable and intriguing characters—a flawed and complicated hero.",,,10/30/66,June 1st 1995,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']",,9781568496429,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411687302l/56649.jpg,3.88,[],157.0,3.0,,56649.The_Adventurers,,,,,92.0,1416.0,712,,Buccaneer,"['429', '514', '363', '90', '20']",,,[],,

Harold Schechter,True Crime: An American Anthology,,English,,"Americans have had an uneasy fascination with crime since the earliest European settlements in the New World, and right from the start true crime writing became a dominant genre in American writing. True Crime: An American Anthology offers the first comprehensive look at the many ways in which American writers have explored crime in a multitude of aspects: the dark motives that spur it, the shock of its impact on society, the effort to make sense of the violent extremes of human behavior. Here is the full spectrum of the true crime genre, including accounts of some of the most notorious criminal cases in American history: the Helen Jewett murder and the once-notorious ?Kentucky tragedy? of the 1830s, the assassination of President Garfield, the Snyder- Gray murder that inspired Double Indemnity, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Black Dahlia, Leopold and Loeb, and the Manson family. True Crime draws upon the writing of literary figures as diverse as Nathaniel Hawthorne (reporting on a visit to a waxworks exhibit of notorious crimes), Ambrose Bierce, Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser (offering his views on a 1934 murder that some saw as a 'copycat' version of An American Tragedy), James Thurber, Joseph Mitchell, and Truman Capote and sources as varied as execution sermons, murder ballads, early broadsides and trial reports, and tabloid journalism of many different eras. It also features the influential true crime writing of best-selling contemporary practitioners like James Ellroy, Gay Talese, Dominick Dunne, and Ann Rule.",,,11/06/08,September 18th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'History', 'Essays', 'Journalism', 'Anthologies', 'Mystery', 'Collections', 'United States']",,9781598530315,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441737416l/3590446._SY475_.jpg,3.87,[],85.0,1.0,,3590446-true-crime,,,,,92.0,354.0,788,,Library of America,"['95', '150', '82', '21', '6']",,,[],,

  Is there room for love in a heart full of secrets? 
One year ago, before Fate took a wrecking ball to his life, Nichol was happily working on his doctorate in linguistics. Now he’s hip deep in sheep, mud and collies. His late brother and mother had been well suited to life on Seacliff Farm. Nichol? Not so much. As lambing season progresses in the teeth of an icy north wind, the last straw is the intruder Nichol catches in the barn. He says his name is Cam, and he’s on the run from a Glasgow gang. Something about the young man’s tired resignation touches Nichol deeply, and instead of giving him the business end of a shotgun, he offers Cam a blanket and a place to stay. Somehow, Cam quickly charms his way through Nichol’s defenses and into his heart. Even his grandfather takes to the cheeky city boy, whose hard work and good head for figures help set the farm back on its feet. As the cold Scottish springtime melts into summer, Nichol finds himself falling in love. When tragedy strikes, Cam’s resolutely held secret is finally revealed and Nichol must face the truth. He’s given his heart away, and it’s time to pay the price. Warning: Contains explicit M/M sex and the disruption of a quiet Scottish town by a fistfight and some tight designer jeans.

Harper Lee,To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition),,,Fiction,"At the age of eight, Scout Finch is an entrenched free-thinker. She can accept her father's warning that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, because mockingbirds harm no one and give great pleasure. The benefits said to be gained from going to school and keeping her temper elude her. The place of this enchanting, intensely moving story is Maycomb, Alabama. The time is the Depression, but Scout and her brother, Jem, are seldom depressed. They have appalling gifts for entertaining themselves—appalling, that is, to almost everyone except their wise lawyer father, Atticus. Atticus is a man of unfaltering good will and humor, and partly because of this, the children become involved in some disturbing adult mysteries: fascinating Boo Radley, who never leaves his house; the terrible temper of Mrs. Dubose down the street; the fine distinctions that make the Finch family ""quality""; the forces that cause the people of Maycomb to show compassion in one crisis and unreasoning cruelty in another. Also because Atticus is what he is, and because he lives where he does, he and his children are plunged into a conflict that indelibly marks their lives—and gives Scout some basis for thinking she knows just about as much about the world as she needs to.",,,,2006.0,,,,0061205699,9780061205699,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M9lKHhLy1y0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.27,,,,,,,,,,,,323.0,,,,250.0,,,,
Harper Lee,Go Set a Watchman,,English,,"From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch—""Scout""—returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past—a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision—a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.

Harper Sloan (Goodreads Author),Cage,,English,,"**Warning** This book is intended for a mature reading** Greg Cage was born to protect. While growing up, he was his mother and sister's shield against the world... until he failed. For the last decade, he has carried that guilt and need for vengeance around... until it was stripped from him. Now, with his best friend getting married and no longer needing his protection, he is even more lost, completely adrift, and desperate for some control. All he has ever known was how to protect: his family, his friends, and his country. Can he go against everything he has ever known, and give up that control? Melissa Larson will never let anyone hold the reins in her life. She has been the rock in her family for more years than she can remember, and the fight to keep them together is her main priority right now. She has always been fiercely independent and proud. The last thing she will ever do is ask for someone else's help. But when that choice is out of her control, forcing her to rely on others to save her and her family, and pick up the pieces that are left, will she be able to let someone else be her strength? The second Greg locks eyes with Meli, he knows that she is someone he needs. Someone he craves. Meli knew the second she met Greg that he would be nothing but trouble and heartache.

  Note from the author--This book is intended for a mature reading audience and isn't suitable for younger readers.
Fate hasn’t always been friends with Isabelle West. In fact, fate has been a downright bitch. Isabelle has learned the hard way how hard life can be when fate isn’t by your side. It can hand you dreams on silver platters, but it can snatch them right back and hand you nightmares. One thing Isabelle knew for sure fate was consistent with was taking away everything she ever loved. For the last two years Isabelle has been slowly clearing the clouds of her past. Happiness is finally on the horizon. She has a thriving business, great friends, and her life back. All she has to do is jump over the last hurdle…her ex-husband. When problems start causing her to fear her new life, and memories that are better left forgotten start rushing to the surface the last thing she needs is a ghost from her past to come knocking on her door. Axel never thought he would look into the eyes of Isabelle West again, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to now. He’s carried his anger for so long he isn’t sure he can just turn it off, but when he is faced with protecting her and an unexpected desire to have her again, life gets a little more complicated.

"Harpie, Karl Wiggins (Goodreads Author) (Editor)","Goodnight, and Thanks for the Vodka [2002]",,English,," A book of Raw Emotion!    In Harpie’s wacky, psycho, screwball, demented book she bares her soul, revealing her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the page   Harpie’s deepest and most intimate feelings gush from her, revealing anxieties ranging from her feelings for her mother, who died in tragic and suspicious circumstances, to her resentment towards her father. And then there were others who abused her physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually. All this is tied up and interwoven with her love of her young son, Mike.  Harpie has memories buried deep in shadowy parts of her subconscious that she’s never been able to reach. They include the mystery surrounding her mother’s murder. With the help of a clinical psychologist and regressive hypnotism, she revisits the past as she dips in and out of Now and Then.  In 'Vodka' Harpie uncovers the missing parts her lost childhood.  More than a modern-day and quirky diary, this is the story of one woman’s life in a typical English small town, encompassing the characters, texture and mentality of everyday living, told with brutal and shameless honesty while all the while cross-threading with a struggle for survival and acceptance.  This is no jump on the bandwagon 'pity me' story, as the vein of humour running through every chapter is testament. Harpie’s goal in writing ‘Vodka’ is to prove to the cynics that it can be done. She can write her truth and miss nothing out – heart attacks, miscarriages, beatings, blood gushing, sex, poverty, mayhem, men and vodka - and always with that beautiful self-deprecating sense of humour common to the British.  After suffering a miscarriage, followed by a heart attack and having stopped breathing in intensive care she signs herself out of the hospital, clothing caked in dried blood, because there’s nobody at home to see to the animals. The following day Harpie berates herself for just sitting about moping all day on the sofa, so scrubs herself up and goes down the pub. The next day she walks four miles to the hospital to pick her car up, reasoning that “the walk might do me some good.” You can’t help but admire and applaud her efforts to keep her life on track, staying in work and as a single mum ensuring her child has a safe home life.  This book began as a social experiment in honesty after a debate among authors about how honest it's possible to be. Harpie set out to prove that everything can be written, the good, the bad and the shameful. There is nowhere that this woman won’t go. If there’s a line to cross, Harpie will stick out her chest and limbo under it, jump over it or dance through it with a glass of vodka in her hand while never spilling a drop.

This autobiographical account chronicles the remarkable odyssey of Harriet Jacobs (1813–1897) whose dauntless spirit and faith carried her from a life of servitude and degradation in North Carolina to liberty and reunion with her children in the North.Written and published in 1861 after Jacobs' harrowing escape from a vile and predatory master, the memoir delivers a powerful and unflinching portrayal of the abuses and hypocrisy of the master-slave relationship. Jacobs writes frankly of the horrors she suffered as a slave, her eventual escape after several unsuccessful attempts, and her seven years in self-imposed exile, hiding in a coffin-like ""garret"" attached to her grandmother's porch.A rare firsthand account of a courageous woman's determination and endurance, this inspirational story also represents a valuable historical record of the continuing battle for freedom and the preservation of family.",,,02/24/61,November 9th 2001,"['Harriet Ann Jacobs', 'James Norcom', 'John  Jacobs', 'Molly Horniblow', 'Samuel Tredwell Sawyer', 'Joseph Sawyer', 'Louisa Sawyer', 'Nathaniel Parker Willis', 'Cornelia Grinnel Willis']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'African American', 'Autobiography', 'Historical', 'School', 'Race']",,9780486419312,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418788224l/152519.jpg,4.13,[],595.0,7.0,,152519.Incidents_in_the_Life_of_a_Slave_Girl,,,,,95.0,42799.0,176,,Dover Publications,"['18006', '15019', '7533', '1615', '626']",,,['North Carolina (United States)'],,

Chessman hauntingly brings to life Paris in 1880, with its thriving art world. The novel's subtle power rises out of a sustained inquiry into art's relation to the ragged world of desire and mortality. Ill with Bright's disease and conscious of her approaching death, Lydia contemplates her world narrowing. With the rising emotional tension between the loving sisters, between one who sees and one who is seen, Lydia asks moving questions about love and art's capacity to remember.

Harrison E. Livingstone,The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy,Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President,,History,"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President Harrison E. Livingstone's major new book, the fifth of his works on the death of JFK, brings together for the first time all of the central evidence demonstrating a domestic Right Wing conspiracy rooted in Texas which assassinated the President on November 22, 1963. The book represents forty years of work. The book discusses in great detail the actual medical evidence and the forgery of the autopsy photographs and X-rays, which Mr. Livingstone first exposed, the alteration of the autopsy report, the framing of the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the substitution and fabrication of every single piece of evidence. It discusses the role played in the murder by some of the most powerful men in the country: Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and Richard Nixon, as well as the rich oil men and companies who backed them. It then describes the cover-ups by the media, the major investigations over the years, the FBI, and the mind-control cooperation at work in the case to misdirect researchers and the public. The book describes in great detail the people and companies in Texas who planned and carried out the assassination. It names names. One recent investigation in the 90s followed Mr. Livingstone's preceeding work and reinvestigated with the witnesses both he and the official investigations had talked to, but this time took into consideration their documentation and what they had actually said, and in a chapter this is his stunning new evidence from the U.S. government under President Clinton that is blowing the lid off the case. Mr. Livingstone first revealed to the Washington press corps in 1998 that there has been such a secret investigation, and spoke for fifty minutes when the Assassination Records Review Board gave their final press conference. As a result, Mr. Livingstone was on all major TV networks and on the ""Today"" show (NBC) with Katie Couric the next morning. The book also contains the story of Dallas doctor Charles Crenshaw's law suit and the depositions of the editor and writer of the Journal of American Medical Association who libeled him in articles in 1992. Dr. Crenshaw's book about trying to save Kennedy at Parkland Hospital shortly after the shooting came out on the same day as Mr. Livingstone's major work on the medical evidence, High Treason 2, were JAMA's targets, and the depositions contain much discussion of Mr. Livingstone's major impact on the JFK case.

Harry Bernstein,The Invisible Wall: A Love Story That Broke Barriers,,English,,"There are places that I have never forgotten. A little cobbled street in a smoky mill town in the North of England has haunted me for the greater part of my life. It was inevitable that I should write about it and the people who lived on both sides of its ""Invisible Wall."" The narrow street where Harry Bernstein grew up, in a small English mill town, was seemingly unremarkable. It was identical to countless other streets in countless other working-class neighborhoods of the early 1900s, except for the ""invisible wall"" that ran down its center, dividing Jewish families on one side from Christian families on the other. Only a few feet of cobblestones separated Jews from Gentiles, but socially, it they were miles apart.On the eve of World War I, Harry's family struggles to make ends meet. His father earns little money at the Jewish tailoring shop and brings home even less, preferring to spend his wages drinking and gambling. Harry's mother, devoted to her children and fiercely resilient, survives on her dreams: new shoes that might secure Harry's admission to a fancy school; that her daughter might marry the local rabbi; that the entire family might one day be whisked off to the paradise of America.Then Harry's older sister, Lily, does the unthinkable: She falls in love with Arthur, a Christian boy from across the street. When Harry unwittingly discovers their secret affair, he must choose between the morals he's been taught all his life, his loyalty to his selfless mother, and what he knows to be true in his own heart.A wonderfully charming memoir written when the author was ninety-three, The Invisible Wall vibrantly brings to life an all-but-forgotten time and place.

And that is possible, even if others remain as they are.If you’re not free now, it might be because you’ve been preoccupied with the people or institutions that you feel have restrained your freedom. I don’t expect you to stop worrying about them merely because I suggest that you do.I do hope to show you, though, that those people and institutions are relatively powerless to stop you — once you decide how you will achieve your freedom. There are things you can do to be free, and if you turn your attention to those things, no one will stand in your way. But when you become preoccupied with those who are blocking you, you overlook the many alternatives you could use to bypass them.The freedom you seek is already available to you, but it has gone unnoticed. There probably are two basic reasons you haven’t taken advantage of that freedom.One reason is that you’re unaware of the many alternatives available to you.",,,01/01/73,March 1st 1998,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Finance', 'Personal Development', 'Economics', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Business']",,9780965603676,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388400345l/82104.jpg,4.08,[],188.0,2.0,,82104.How_I_Found_Freedom_in_an_Unfree_World,,,,,91.0,1186.0,387,,Liamworks,"['538', '345', '197', '70', '36']",,,[],,

If Bacon County was a place of grinding poverty, poor soil, and blood feuds, it was also a deeply mystical place, where snakes talked, birds could possess a small boy by spitting in his mouth, and faith healers and conjure women kept ghosts and devils at bay.At once shocking and elegiac, heartrending and comical, A Childhood not only recalls the transforming events of Crews's youth but conveys his growing sense of self in a world ""in which survival depended on raw courage, a courage born out of desperation and sustained by a lack of alternatives.""Amid portraits of relatives and neighbors, Bacon County lore, and details of farm life, Crews tells of his father's death; his friendship with Willalee Bookatee, the son of a black hired hand; his bout with polio; his mother and stepfather's failing marriage; his near-fatal scalding at a hog-killing; and a five-month sojourn in Jacksonville, Florida. These and other memories define, with reverence and affection, Harry Crews's childhood world: ""its people and its customs and all its loveliness and all its ugliness."" Imaginative and gripping, A Childhood re-creates in detail one writer's search for past and self, a search for a time and place lost forever except in memory.",,,11/06/78,October 1st 1995,[],Hardcover,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Southern', 'Southern Gothic', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'Literature', 'Family']",,9780820317595,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388584870l/24849.jpg,4.37,[],55.0,1.0,,24849.A_Childhood,,,,,97.0,1317.0,192,,University of Georgia Press,"['708', '439', '132', '25', '13']",,,[],,
Harry Dolan (Goodreads Author),Bad Things Happen,,English,,"The man who calls himself David Loogan is leading a quiet, anonymous life in the college town of Ann Arbor, Michigan. He’s hoping to escape a violent past he would rather forget. But his solitude is broken when he finds himself drawn into a friendship with Tom Kristoll, publisher of the mystery magazine Gray Streets—and into an affair with Laura, Tom’s sleek blond wife. When Tom offers him a job as an editor, Loogan sees no harm in accepting. What he doesn’t realize is that the stories in Gray Streets tend to follow a simple formula: Plans go wrong. Bad things happen. People die.Elizabeth Waishkey is a single mother raising a fifteen-year-old daughter. She’s also the most talented detective in the Ann Arbor Police Department. But when Tom Kristoll turns up dead, she doesn’t quite know what to make of David Loogan. Is he a killer, or an ally who might help her find the truth? Loogan, for his part, would like to trust her, but he has his own agenda. He suspects his friend’s death is part of a much larger puzzle, and he’s not going to wait for someone else to put the pieces together. As Loogan and Elizabeth navigate their way through the Kristoll's world, they find no shortage of people with motives for murder, from a young graduate student obsessed with Laura Kristoll to a trio of bestselling writers, all of them with secrets they don’t want uncovered.As the deaths start mounting up—some of them echoing stories published in Gray Streets—Loogan begins to look more and more like the most promising suspect.Soon it becomes clear that only Elizabeth can find the path to solving both the murders and the mystery of Loogan himself. But by the time she unravels the twisted skein, Loogan May be indicted for murder—or more likely, become the next victim.",David Loogan #1,,11/06/09,July 23rd 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Murder Mystery', 'Adult']",,9780399155635,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442945696l/5819399._SY475_.jpg,3.61,[],93.0,1.0,,5819399-bad-things-happen,,,,,89.0,5664.0,338,,Putnam Adult,"['951', '2282', '1834', '466', '131']",,,"['Ann Arbor, Michigan (United States)']",,
Harry G. Frankfurt,On Bullshit,,,Philosophy,"Presents a theory of bullshit, how it differs from lying, how those who engage in it change the rules of conversation, and how indulgence in bullshit can alter a person's ability to tell the truth.",,,,2005.0,,,,0691122946,9780691122946,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WBfnlgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.57,,,,,,,,,,,,67.0,,,,8773.0,,,,
Harry G. Frankfurt,On Bullshit,,English,,"One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, ""we have no theory.""Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.",,,11/06/86,January 30th 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Humor', 'Language', 'Politics', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural']",,9780691122946,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393606915l/385.jpg,3.58,[],92.0,1.0,,385.On_Bullshit,,,,,86.0,10803.0,74,,Princeton University Press,"['2332', '3491', '3427', '1210', '343']",,,[],,

  'Harry Leslie Smith is a vital and powerful voice speaking across generations about the struggle for a just society' Jeremy Corbyn
THIS A CALL TO ARMS FOR THE MANY, NOT THE FEW: DON'T LET THE PAST BECOME OUR FUTURE Harry Leslie Smith is a great British stalwart. A survivor of the Great Depression, a Second World War veteran, a lifelong Labour supporter and a proud Yorkshire man, Harry's life has straddled two centuries. As a young man, he witnessed a country in crisis with no healthcare, no relief for the poor, and a huge economic gulf between the North and South. Now in his nineties, Harry wanders through the streets of his youth and wonders whether anything has actually changed.Britain is at its most dangerous juncture since Harry's youth - the NHS and social housing are in crisis, whilst Brexit and an unpopular government continue to divide the country - but there is hope. Just as Clement Attlee provided hope in 1945, Labour's triumphant comeback of June 2017 is a beacon of light in this season of discontent. Britain has overcome adversity before and will do so again - a new nation will be forged from the ashes of grave injustice.Moving and passionate, Don't Let My Past be Your Future interweaves memoir and polemic in a call to arms. Above all, this book is a homage to the boundless grace and resilience of the human spirit.",,,,September 14th 2017,[],Kindle Edition,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Activism', 'War', 'Society']",,B06XCP5FLL,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1505342748l/36235634._SY475_.jpg,4.38,[],83.0,1.0,,36235634-don-t-let-my-past-be-your-future,,,,,99.0,177.0,240,,Constable,"['94', '59', '22', '1', '1']",,,[],,

Harry N. MacLean (Goodreads Author),"In Broad Daylight, Classic Print Edition",,,,"Edgar-Award winning author Harry MacLean is bringing the New York Times bestseller ""In Broad Daylight"" back to print in a Classic print trade paper edition that also includes ""The Story Behind 'In Broad Daylight.'"" ""In Broad Daylight"" tells the story of the killing of Ken Rex McElroy on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri in July 1981. McElroy, an illiterate hog farmer, had terrorized all of northwest Missouri for over 20 years, until the town, and even law enforcement, was terrified of him. McElroy was shot as he sat in his truck in front of the tavern. Over 45 men witnessed the shooting. Despite two eyewitness accounts and three grand jury investigations, no one has been prosecuted for the crime. ""In Broad Daylight"" won an Edgar Award for Best True Crime. It was also made into a movie starring Brian Denehey, Cloris Leachman and Chris Cooper. It was re-released as an e-book on Amazon July 2012 on the 31st anniversary of the killing. St. Martin's Press published the last print edition in 2006.In ""The Story Behind 'In Broad Daylight,'"" MacLean tells how he researched and wrote the book. He tells of guns being drawn on him, being bitten by a dog, and a confrontation with the killer on the killer's ranch. In addition to updates on characters from the book (including who is still alive and who has died), the book answers many questions about the killing itself, such as who was involved, and what has become of them. MacLean describes the breakthrough events when key characters agreed to speak with him, and he realized he would finally get the story. The author also discusses the nature of the moral consequences of the killing for the town and those involved in the crime. The mini-book contains never-before published photographs of some of the principal characters, including the killer.

Harry T. Hunt,"On the Nature of Consciousness: Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives",,English,,"This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuropsychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various ""new age"" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.",,,11/06/95,August 30th 1995,[],Hardcover,[],,9780300062304,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328870950l/813603.jpg,4.2,[],52.0,1.0,,813603.On_the_Nature_of_Consciousness,,,,,90.0,10.0,384,,Yale University Press,"['6', '1', '2', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Harry Turtledove,La legione perduta,,Italian,,"Marcus Aemilius Scaurus non sentiva dentro di sé un'autentica vocazione guerriera: aveva intrapreso la carriera militare come tribuno dell'esercito di Roma solo perché era un buon trampolino per la sua futura carriera politica. Ma quando la sua spada, infusa della magia degli antichi druidi, toccò la lama del capo celta Viridovix, egualmente incantata, l'intera legione - e Viridovix con essa - fu trascinata in un altro tempo e in un altro spazio.Nel magnifico ma tormentato impero di Videssos i romani erano esuli, stranieri in terra straniera. Solo con il coraggio, con le spade e con la perizia militare la legione perduta poteva ritagliarsi un posto adeguato nella storia della sua nuova, fantastica patria.I barbari Yezda, istigati dal perfido mago Avshar, dilagavano nelle terre dell'Impero portando la disperazione e la morte in nome del satanico dio Skotos.L'Impero aveva bisogno di mercenari, ma Marco Emilio Scauro non avrebbe mai immaginato di dover marciare con imperatore Mavrikios Gavras verso la battaglia finale!",The Videssos Books #1,,11/06/87,1989,[],Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Alternate History', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Historical Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780345330673,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348920900l/16052983.jpg,3.92,[],93.0,1.0,,16052983-la-legione-perduta,,,,,94.0,1674.0,374,,Club degli Editori (su licenza Nord),"['489', '680', '402', '83', '20']",,,[],,
Harry Turtledove,American Front,,English,,"When the Great War engulfed Europe in 1914, the United States and the Confederate States of America, bitter enemies for five decades, entered the fray on opposite sides: the United States aligned with the newly strong Germany, while the Confederacy joined forces with their longtime allies, Britain and France. But it soon became clear to both sides that this fight would be different--that war itself would never be the same again. For this was to be a protracted, global conflict waged with new and chillingly efficient innovations--the machine gun, the airplane, poison gas, and trench warfare.Across the Americas, the fighting raged like wildfire on multiple and far-flung fronts. As President Theodore Roosevelt rallied the diverse ethnic groups of the northern states--Irish and Italians, Mormons and Jews--Confederate President Woodrow Wilson struggled to hold together a Confederacy still beset by ignorance, prejudice, and class divisions. And as the war thundered on, southern blacks, oppressed for generations, found themselves fatefully drawn into a climactic confrontation . . .",Great War #1,,05/12/98,May 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Alternate History', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'War', 'Fantasy', 'Military Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780345405609,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320502845l/751724.jpg,3.89,[],98.0,1.0,,751724.American_Front,,,,,94.0,3503.0,562,,Del Rey,"['935', '1508', '847', '173', '40']",,,[],,

"Harsha Walia (Goodreads Author), Andrea Smith (Foreword)",Undoing Border Imperialism,,English,,"""Harsha Walia has played a central role in building some of North America’s most innovative, diverse, and effective new move­ments. That this brilliant organizer and theorist has found time to share her wisdom in this book is a tremendous gift to us all."" —Naomi Klein, author of The Shock DoctrineUndoing Border Imperialism combines academic discourse, lived experiences of displacement, and movement-based practices into an exciting new book. By reformulating immigrant rights movements within a transnational analysis of capitalism, labor exploitation, settler colonialism, state building, and racialized empire, it provides the alternative conceptual frameworks of border imperialism and decolonization. Drawing on the author’s experiences in No One Is Illegal, this work offers relevant insights for all social movement organizers on effective strategies to overcome the barriers and borders within movements in order to cultivate fierce, loving, and sustainable communities of resistance striving toward liberation. The author grounds the book in collective vision, with short contributions from over twenty organizers and writers from across North America.""Border imperialism is an apt conceptualization for capturing the politics of massive displacement due to capitalist neoglobalization. Within the wealthy countries, Canada’s No One Is Illegal is one of the most effective organizations of migrants and allies. Walia is an outstanding organizer who has done a lot of thinking and can write—not a common combination. Besides being brilliantly conceived and presented, this book is the first extended work on immigration that refuses to make First Nations sovereignty invisible."" —Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, author of Indians of the Americas and Blood on the Border""Harsha Walia’s Undoing Border Imperialism demonstrates that geography has certainly not ended, nor has the urge for people to stretch out our arms across borders to create our communities. One of the most rewarding things about this book is its capaciousness—astute insights that emerge out of careful organizing linked to the voices of a generation of strugglers, trying to find their own analysis to build their own movements to make this world our own. This is both a manual and a memoir, a guide to the world and a guide to the organizer’s heart."" —Vijay Prashad, author of The Darker Nations: A People’s History of the Third World""This book belongs in every wannabe revolutionary’s war backpack. I addictively jumped all over its contents: a radical mixtape of ancestral wisdoms to present-day-grounded organizers theoriz­ing about their own experiences. A must for me is Walia’s decision to infuse this volume’s fight against border imperialism, white supremacy, and empire with the vulnerability of her own personal narrative. This book is a breath of fresh air and offers an urgently needed movement-based praxis. Undoing Border Imperialism is too hot to be sitting on bookshelves; it will help make the revolution."" —Ashanti Alston, Black Panther elder and former political prisonerOther Contributors: Yogi Acharya, Carmen Aguirre, Tara Atluri, Annie Banks, Mel Bazil, Nazila Bettache, Adil Charkaoui, Yen Chu, Karen Cocq, Jessica Danforth, Ruby Smith Diaz, Nassim Elbardouh, Craig Fortier, Harjap Grewal, Mostafa Henaway, Freda Huson, Syed Khalid Hussan, Jane Kirby, Aylwin Lo, Karla Lottini, Alex Mah, Robyn Maynard, Graciela Flores Mendez, Cecily Nicholson, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Toghestiy, Sozan Savehilaghi, Mac Scott, Lily Shinde, and Rafeef Ziadah.",Anarchist Intervention Series #6,,11/12/13,February 15th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Activism', 'Race', 'Social Justice', 'Feminism', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Academic', 'History']",,9781849351348,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393637318l/20937784.jpg,4.49,[],79.0,1.0,,20937784-undoing-border-imperialism,,,,,97.0,307.0,340,,AK Press,"['196', '75', '27', '8', '1']",,,[],,
"Hart Crane, Langdon Hammer (Editor)",Complete Poems and Selected Letters,,English,,"No American poet has so swiftly and decisively transformed the course of poetry as Hart Crane. In his haunted, brief life, Crane fashioned a distinctively modern idiom that fused the ornate rhetoric of the Elizabethans, the ecstatic enigmas of Rimbaud, and the prophetic utterances and cosmic sympathy of Whitman, in a quest for wholeness and healing in what he called ""the broken world."" White Buildings, perhaps the greatest debut volume in American poetry since Leaves of Grass, is but an exquisite prelude to Crane's masterpiece The Bridge, his magnificent evocation of America from Columbus to the Jazz Age that countered the pessimism of Eliot's The Waste Land and became a crucial influence on poets whose impact continues to this day. This edition is the largest collection of Crane's writings ever published. Gathered here are the complete poems and published prose, along with a generous selection of Crane's letters, several of which have never before been published. In his letters Crane elucidates his aims as an artist and provides fascinating glosses on his poetry. His voluminous correspondence also offers an intriguing glimpse into his complicated personality, as well as his tempestuous relationships with family, lovers, and writers such as Allen Tate, Waldo Frank, Yvor Winters, Jean Toomer, Marianne Moore, E. E. Cummings, William Carlos Williams, and Katherine Anne Porter. Several letters included here are published for the first time. This landmark 850-page volume features a detailed and freshly-researched chronology of Crane's life by editor Langdon Hammer, chair of the English Department at Yale University and a biographer of Crane, as well as extensive explanatory notes, and over fifty biographical sketches of Crane's correspondents.",,,10/30/68,September 21st 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'American']",,9781931082990,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309200646l/75493.jpg,4.32,[],98.0,1.0,,75493.Complete_Poems_and_Selected_Letters,,,,,95.0,189.0,864,,Library of America,"['112', '40', '27', '6', '4']",,,[],,

The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack. In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and arguably Japan’s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe—from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche.

"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin (Translator)",After Dark,,English,,"A short, sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakami’s masterworks The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore.At its center are two sisters—Eri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny’s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims they’ve met before, a burly female “love hotel” manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency—the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love.

A year later, he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and--even more important--on his writing. Equal parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.""",,,10/15/07,July 29th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Japan', 'Sports', 'Japanese Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Writing', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780307269195,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473397159l/2195464._SY475_.jpg,3.85,[],470.0,6.0,,2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running,,,,,93.0,106227.0,188,,Knopf Publishing Group,"['27769', '43583', '27699', '5839', '1337']",,,[],,
"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel (Translator)",Kafka on the Shore,,English,,"Kafka on the Shore, a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.",海辺のカフカ,,10/28/02,01/03/06,"['Kafka Tamura', 'Sakura', 'Satoru Nakata', 'Oshima', 'Miss Saeki', 'Hoshino']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Japan', 'Fantasy', 'Japanese Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia']",,9781400079278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429638085l/4929.jpg,4.13,"['World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2006)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2005)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2006)', 'PEN Translation Prize for Philip Gabriel (2006)', 'Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Nominee for Preis der Jugendjury (2005)', 'Tähtifantasia Award (2010)', 'Βραβείο Βιβλίου Public for Μεταφρασμένο μυθιστόρημα της χρονιάς (Translator: Αργυρώ Μαντόγλου) (2016)']",41731.0,474.0,,4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore,,,,,95.0,305688.0,467,,Vintage International,"['125586', '116603', '46868', '12046', '4585']",,,['Takamatsu (Japan)'],,

But two key issues emerge: rules of conversational sequencing - central to the articulation of interaction, and membership categorization devices - central to the social organization of knowledge. This volume culminates in the extensive and formal explication of turn-taking which Sacks delivered in Fall, 1967.  Volume II contains the lectures of Spring 1968 through Spring 1972. Again he touches on a wide range of subjects, such as the poetics of ordinary talk, the integrative function of public tragedy, and pauses in spelling out a word. He develops a major new theme: storytelling in converstion, with an attendant focus on topic. His investigation of conversational sequencing continues, and this volume culminates in the elegant dissertation on adjacency pairs which Sacks delivered in Spring, 1972.",,,02/01/95,February 28th 1995,[],Paperback,['Sociology'],,9781557867056,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1182817563l/1333429.jpg,4.73,[],87.0,1.0,,1333429.Lectures_on_Conversation_Volumes_I_and_II,,,,,100.0,11.0,,,Wiley-Blackwell,"['9', '1', '1', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Haven Kimmel,The Used World,,English,,"It was mid-December in Jonah, Indiana, a place where Fate can be decided by the weather, and a storm was gathering overhead.So Haven Kimmel, bestselling author of A Girl Named Zippy, prepares us to enter The Used World -- a world where big hearts are frequently broken and sometimes repaired; where the newfangled and the old-fashioned battle it out in daily encounters both large and small; where wondrous things unfold just beneath the surface of everyday life; and where the weather is certainly biblical and might just be prophetic. Hazel Hunnicutt's Used World Emporium is a sprawling antique store that is ""the station at the end of the line for objects that sometimes appeared tricked into visiting there."" Hazel, the proprietor, is in her sixties, and it's a toss-up as to whether she's more attached to her mother or her cats. She's also increasingly attached to her two employees: Claudia Modjeski -- freakishly tall, forty-odd years old -- who might finally be undone by the extreme loneliness that's dogged her all of her life; and Rebekah Shook, pushing thirty, still living in her fervently religious father's home, and carrying the child of the man who recently broke her heart. The three women struggle -- separately and together, through relationships, religion, and work -- to find their place in this world. And it turns out that they are bound to each other not only by the past but also by the future, as not one but two babies enter their lives, turning their formerly used world brand-new again. Astonishing for what it reveals about the human capacity for both grace and mischief, The Used World forms a loose trilogy with Kimmel's two previous novels, The Solace of Leaving Early and Something Rising (Light and Swift). This is a book about all of America by way of a single midwestern town called Jonah, and the actual breathing histories going on as Indiana's stark landscape is transformed by dying small-town centers and proliferating big-box stores and SUVs. It's about generations of deception, anguish, and love, and the idiosyncratic ways spirituality plays out in individual lives. By turns wise and hilarious, tender and fierce, heartrending and inspiring, The Used World charts the many meanings of the place we call home.",,,08/28/07,September 18th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'Womens', 'Love', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Unfinished', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780743247788,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388566388l/15173.jpg,3.63,[],125.0,2.0,,15173.The_Used_World,,,,,85.0,1501.0,308,,Free Press,"['347', '534', '401', '156', '63']",,,['Indiana (United States)'],,

After years of languorous existence, this oversized couch potato emerged from the den to pursue a higher education. Delonda was well read but in other ways seemed ill suited for college: This middle-aged, 260-pound coed had a husband who disapproved of the entire venture, no driver's license, and almost no money.

Haven Kimmel,A Girl Named Zippy,,English,,"When Haven Kimmel was born in 1965, Mooreland, Indiana, was a sleepy little hamlet of three hundred people. Nicknamed ""Zippy"" for the way she would bolt around the house, this small girl was possessed of big eyes and even bigger ears. In this witty and lovingly told memoir, Kimmel takes readers back to a time when small-town America was caught in the amber of the innocent postwar period–people helped their neighbors, went to church on Sunday, and kept barnyard animals in their backyards. Laced with fine storytelling, sharp wit, dead-on observations, and moments of sheer joy, Haven Kimmel's straight-shooting portrait of her childhood gives us a heroine who is wonderfully sweet and sly as she navigates the quirky adult world that surrounds Zippy.",Zippy #1,,03/20/01,September 3rd 2002,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Humor', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Family']",,9780767915052,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348288617l/406185.jpg,3.8,[],70.0,1.0,,406185.A_Girl_Named_Zippy,,,,,90.0,33982.0,283,,Broadway Books,"['9449', '12203', '9086', '2491', '753']",,,['United States of America'],,
Haven Kimmel,The Solace of Leaving Early,,English,,"Using small-town life as a springboard to explore the loftiest of ideas, Haven Kimmel’s irresistibly smart and generous first novel is at once a romance and a haunting meditation on grief and faith. Langston Braverman returns to Haddington, Indiana (pop. 3,062) after walking out on an academic career that has equipped her for little but lording it over other people. Amos Townsend is trying to minister to a congregation that would prefer simple affirmations to his esoteric brand of theology.What draws these difficult—if not impossible—people together are two wounded little girls who call themselves Immaculata and Epiphany. They are the daughters of Langston’s childhood friend and the witnesses to her murder. And their need for love is so urgent that neither Langston nor Amos can resist it, though they do their best to resist each other. Deftly walking the tightrope between tragedy and comedy, The Solace of Leaving Early is a joyous story about finding one’s better self through accepting the shortcomings of others.",,,01/01/02,May 13th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Book Club', 'Literature', 'Spirituality']",,9781400033348,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320408272l/534274.jpg,3.79,['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2003)'],97.0,1.0,,534274.The_Solace_of_Leaving_Early,,,,,90.0,3141.0,288,,Anchor,"['859', '1161', '798', '249', '74']",,,['Indiana (United States)'],,

Katrina rearranged the city’s face, there are more people, the streets are meaner, and most importantly, the boy she had a crush on her entire childhood is all grown up. In a big, bad way.

The tall, painfully handsome fae lord was born with so much power, the fae kings not only envied but feared him, and banished him to a forbidden realm to be forgotten. There, he was tasked with ruling over the deadliest creatures known to the fae worlds, and his veritable battle as their sovereign is never-ending. As one of the 13 Kings, his destiny foretells an end to his solitude with the appearance of an equally powerful queen. But that kind of power is hard to come by. And power or not, Damon can’t imagine any woman willingly joining him in the eternal misery to which he has been tasked.Until he meets the beautiful, strong and selfless Diana Piper. Diana has been hiding a potent secret from the world for decades. She was born with abilities others would fight to win, and kill to keep. To make matters worse, she is a sensitive soul who, despite the danger it poses to herself, uses these powers to make the world a better place.

    Plus, her rent is due.
    Here’s the problem: Lucy doesn’t have the knack for matchmaking. According to family legend, every Valentine has been blessed by Cupid with the ability to read “auras” and pair up perfect couples. But not Lucy. Her skills were zapped away years ago in an electrical surge, and now all she can do is find lost objects. What good is that in the matchmaking world? You’d be surprised. In a city like Boston, everyone’s looking for something. So when Lucy locates a missing wedding ring—on a dead body—she asks the sexy private eye who lives upstairs to help her solve the perfect crime. And who knows? Maybe she’ll find the perfect love while she’s at it…

""Hier ist er ganz -- in seiner Religiosität, seiner Erfolgsanbeterei und namenlosen Zivilfeigheit"". Der Untertan, die Geschichte Diederich Heßlings, in jungen Jahren von einem drakonisch strafenden Vater und einer saumseligen Mutter großgezogen, anschließend weiter zurechtgeschliffen im Schul- und Militärdrill der wilhelminischen Ära, gerät bei Heinrich Mann zum Fallbeispiel deutscher Katzbuckelei und Tyrannenmentalität, die sich Macht und Gewaltstrukturen unterwirft, um letztlich an ihnen teilhaben zu dürfen. Heßling, vordergründig als Aufsteiger gefeiert, übernimmt die väterliche Papierfabrik und wird zum mächtigsten Bürger der fiktiven Kleinstadt Netzig. In seiner Mimikri geht er dabei soweit, neben der chauvinistischen Phrasendrescherei der Deutschnationalen auch noch das äußere Erscheinungsbild des Kaisers zu imitieren.

Heinrich von Kleist,Die Verlobung in St. Domingo,,German,,"Der ehemalige Sklave Congo Hoango zieht mit einer Horde Gleichgesinnter plündernd und mordend durch die französische Kolonie Domingo, heute Haiti. Seine Gefährtin, die alte Dienerin Babekan, und ihre fünfzehnjährige Tochter, eine fast hellhäutige Mestizin, benutzt er, um vorbeireisende Weiße in sein Haus zu locken und sie dort umzubringen. Auch der junge Schweizer Gustav von Ried gerät mit seiner Familie in das Haus. Doch Toni und Gustav verlieben sich in einander und verloben sich schließlich. Als Congo unerwartet zurückkehrt, entwickelt Toni einen Befreiungsplan. Damit Congo keinen Verdacht schöpft, fesselt sie den schlafenden Geliebten und holt heimlich seine Familie. Gustav glaubt nun, Toni habe ihn verraten, und als diese ihn befreien will, erschießt er sie rasend vor Wut. Zu spät erkennt er seinen Irrtum und nimmt sich das Leben.Die 1811 veröffentlichte Novelle ist die letzte Erzählung, die Kleist schrieb, bevor er sich noch im selben Jahr das Leben nahm. Wie bei vielen Erzählungen Kleists, so liegt auch hier ein historisches Ereignis zu Grunde. Der Sklavenaufstand in Haiti fand nur wenige Jahre vor der Veröffentlichung der Novelle im Jahre 1803 statt, und so ist Kleists Auseinandersetzung mit Sklaverei und Menschenrechten besonders wegen seiner damaligen Aktualität interessant.

Well educated successful Gen X-ers with a misguided sense of entitlement, an insatiable appetite for luxury goods and a set of lifestyle choices that includes everything from Dr. Bernstein diets and recreational drug misuse, to the bizarre antics of the sexually deviant and scandalously promiscuous. And in the mix of dating, mating and moral dysfunction you’ll meet characters like Nina, forty-four, the divorced motherof twins who accidentally stumbles from one mortifying encounter to another in an effort to end a two-year long sexual drought.

Helen DeWitt,The Last Samurai,,English,,"Helen DeWitt's extraordinary debut, The Last Samurai, centers on the relationship between Sibylla, a single mother of precocious and rigorous intelligence, and her son, who, owing to his mother's singular attitude to education, develops into a prodigy of learning. Ludo reads Homer in the original Greek at 4 before moving on to Hebrew, Japanese, Old Norse, and Inuit; studying advanced mathematical techniques (Fourier analysis and Laplace transformations); and, as the title hints, endlessly watching and analyzing Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, The Seven Samurai. But the one question that eludes an answer is that of the name of his father: Sibylla believes the film obliquely provides the male role models that Ludo's genetic father cannot, and refuses to be drawn on the question of paternal identity. The child thinks differently, however, and eventually sets out on a search, one that leads him beyond the certainties of acquired knowledge into the complex and messy world of adults.The novel draws on themes topical and perennial--the hothousing of children, the familiar literary trope of the quest for the (absent) father--and as such, divides itself into two halves: the first describes Ludo's education, the second follows him in his search for his father and father figures. The first stresses a sacred, Apollonian pursuit of logic, precise (if wayward) erudition, and the erratic and endlessly fascinating architecture of languages, while the second moves this knowledge into the world of emotion, human ambitions, and their attendant frustrations and failures.The Last Samurai is about the pleasure of ideas, the rich varieties of human thought, the possibilities that life offers us, and, ultimately, the balance between the structures we make of the world and the chaos that it proffers in return. Stylistically, the novel mirrors this ambivalence: DeWitt's remarkable prose follows the shifts and breaks of human consciousness and memory, capturing the intrusions of unspoken thought that punctuate conversation while providing tantalizing disquisitions on, for example, Japanese grammar or the physics of aerodynamics. It is remarkable, profound, and often very funny.

Helen Drayton (Goodreads Author),The Crystal Bird,,English,,"Telescoping back and forth between modern and ancient times, ""The Crystal Bird"" is a unique, compelling and magical masterpiece of adventure, star-crossed love, and history. Death waits in shadows as slavers make their way through East Africa's Great Rift Valley. They attack a group of young warriors who strike back. Six centuries later, a team, led by archaeologists Allan Cline and Christopher Ward, is exploring caves in the very region. Mesmerized by 50,000-year-old-artefacts, they stumble into a strange land and find themselves among the Ashais people who protect a strange bird and world-changing secrets. The archaeologists have a compelling story to tell, truths that upend written history and challenge beliefs about the very genesis of humankind. The people sense danger and take preemptive action to protect their secrets and way of life. The archaeologists feel the weight of centuries of betrayal and brutality that shatters lives.“An epic tale of an ancient civilization confronting the present…explorers are torn between their respect and reverence for the land they’ve discovered and the potential cures they could bring back to the world, transforming this fast-paced adventure story into a much deeper and more complicated tale…A unique, engaging story of star-crossed love, history and mythical magic.”—Kirkus Reviews.“A dynamic story that echoes classic time-and-space travel odysseys...it grips readers with its focus on the dilemma of imperiled explorers and star-crossed lovers, and the contrastingly serene, enviable lives of the Ashais...Readers will no doubt be enchanted by Drayton’s atmospheric descriptions of the magical world of Ashaise.”—ForeWord Clarion Reviews.""A beautifully written tale of what was, what could have been, and what could still be! Set in a land outside time, it deals with all of mankind’s frailties and strengths. It’s also a beautiful love story. This book has an intricate storyline with well-developed characters. It’s the first book I have ever read where the main characters were African/African American. I was so impressed with the attention to detail, supported by authentic research showing that many of us have badly pre-conceived notions of what civilization really is and where it started. It bumped up my curiosity to learn more about these ancient civilizations and I am amazed at what I have found. Worth every penny and I strongly recommend it!"" - Thora Dorn.""Plenty of action throughout to keep the reader interested. Perfect amount of twists and turns you don't expect.

Helen Fisher,Why Him? Why Her?: Understanding Your Personality Type and Finding the Perfect Match,,English,,"
  
    
      A groundbreaking book about how your personality type determines who you love.
    
    Why do you fall in love with one person rather than another? In this fascinating and informative book, Helen Fisher, one of the world’s leading experts on romantic love, unlocks the hidden code of desire and attachment. Each of us, it turns out, primarily expresses one of four broad personality types—Explorer, Builder, Director, or Negotiator—and each of these types is governed by different chemical systems in the brain. Driven by this biology, we are attracted to partners who both mirror and complement our own personality type. 
    Based on entirely new research—including a detailed questionnaire completed by seven million people in thirty-three countries—Why Him? Why Her? will change your understanding of why you love him (or her) and help you use nature’s chemistry to find and keep your life partner.

When the Danish Vikings, led by Swein Forkbeard and his son, Cnut, cause a maelstrom of chaos, Emma, as Queen, must take control if the Kingdom-and her crown-are to be salvaged. Smarter than history remembers, and stronger than the foreign invaders who threaten England's shores, Emma risks everything on a gamble that could either fulfill her ambitions and dreams or destroy her completely. Emma, the Queen of Saxon England, comes to life through the exquisite writing of Helen Hollick, who shows in this epic tale how one of the most compelling and vivid heroines in English history stood tall through a turbulent fifty-year reign of proud determination, tragic despair, and triumph over treachery.",Saxon #2,,08/05/04,December 10th 2010,"['Emma of Normandy', 'Cnut the Great', 'Edward the Confessor', 'Æthelred the Unready', 'Godwin, Earl of Wessex', 'Edmund Ironside']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Medieval', '11th Century', 'Romance', 'Anglo Saxon', 'Fantasy', 'Arthurian']",,9781402240683,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1337455264l/7717338.jpg,3.7,[],86.0,1.0,,7717338-the-forever-queen,,,,,88.0,3657.0,635,,Sourcebooks Landmark,"['882', '1355', '970', '326', '124']",,,['United Kingdom'],,

Her tenacious struggle to overcome these handicaps-with the help of her inspired teacher, Anne Sullivan-is one of the great stories of human courage and dedication. In this classic autobiography, first published in 1903, Miss Keller recounts the first 22 years of her life, including the magical moment at the water pump when, recognizing the connection between the word ""water"" and the cold liquid flowing over her hand, she realized that objects had names. Subsequent experiences were equally noteworthy: her joy at eventually learning to speak, her friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Edward Everett Hale and other notables, her education at Radcliffe (from which she graduated cum laude), and-underlying all-her extraordinary relationship with Miss Sullivan, who showed a remarkable genius for communicating with her eager and quick-to-learn pupil.",,,10/28/02,05/01/90,"['Anne Sullivan', 'Helen Keller']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Disability', 'Inspirational']",,9780553213874,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320429331l/821611.jpg,4.08,[],10089.0,172.0,,821611.The_Story_of_My_Life,,,,,93.0,131878.0,240,,Bantam Classics,"['55412', '43201', '24385', '5676', '3204']",,,"['Tuscumbia, Alabama (United States)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Alabama (United States)']",,

Helen Macdonald,H is for Hawk,,English,,"Obsession, madness, memory, myth, and history combine to achieve a distinctive blend of nature writing and memoir from an outstanding literary innovator.When Helen Macdonald's father died suddenly on a London street, she was devastated. An experienced falconer—Helen had been captivated by hawks since childhood—she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself ""in the hawk's wild mind to tame her"" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life. Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry.

Helen Nearing,Loving and Leaving the Good Life,,English,,"Helen and Scott Nearing, authors of Living the Good Life and many other bestselling books, lived together for 53 years until Scott's death at age 100. Loving and Leaving the Good Life is Helen's testimonial to their life together and to what they stood for: self-sufficiency, generosity, social justice, and peace.In 1932, after deciding it would be better to be poor in the country than in the city, Helen and Scott moved from New York Ciy to Vermont. Here they created their legendary homestead which they described in Living the Good Life: How to Live Simply and Sanely in a Troubled World, a book that has sold 250,000 copies and inspired thousands of young people to move back to the land.The Nearings moved to Maine in 1953, where they continued their hard physical work as homesteaders and their intense intellectual work promoting social justice. Thirty years later, as Scott approached his 100th birthday, he decided it was time to prepare for his death. He stopped eating, and six weeks later Helen held him and said goodbye.Loving and Leaving the Good Life is a vivid self-portrait of an independent, committed and gifted woman. It is also an eloquent statement of what it means to grow old and to face death quietly, peacefully, and in control. At 88, Helen seems content to be nearing the end of her good life.

Lily is gone and her twins, Miranda and Eliot, and her husband, the gentle Luc, mourn her absence with unspoken intensity. All is not well with the house, either, which creaks and grumbles and malignly confuses visitors in its mazy rooms, forcing winter apples in the garden when the branches should be bare. Generations of women inhabit its walls. And Miranda, with her new appetite for chalk and her keen sense for spirits, is more attuned to them than she is to her brother and father.

Helen Prejean,Dead Man Walking: The Eyewitness Account of the Death Penalty That Sparked a National Debate,,English,,"In 1982, Sister Helen Prejean became the spiritual advisor to Patrick Sonnier, the convicted killer of two teenagers who was sentenced to die in the electric chair of Louisiana’s Angola State Prison. In the months before Sonnier’s death, the Roman Catholic nun came to know a man who was as terrified as he had once been terrifying. She also came to know the families of the victims and the men whose job it was to execute—men who often harbored doubts about the rightness of what they were doing. Out of that dreadful intimacy comes a profoundly moving spiritual journey through our system of capital punishment. Here Sister Helen confronts both the plight of the condemned and the rage of the bereaved, the fears of a society shattered by violence and the Christian imperative of love. On its original publication in 1993, Dead Man Walking emerged as an unprecedented look at the human consequences of the death penalty. Now, some two decades later, this story—which has inspired a film, a stage play, an opera and a musical album—is more gut-wrenching than ever, stirring deep and life-changing reflection in all who encounter it.",,,11/06/93,May 31st 1994,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Crime', 'Politics', 'Social Justice', 'Religion', 'Biography Memoir', 'History']",,9780679751311,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372038703l/133793.jpg,4.1,[],88.0,1.0,,133793.Dead_Man_Walking,,,,,96.0,6933.0,288,,Vintage,"['2617', '2757', '1272', '234', '53']",,,[],,

Men are sensing the backlash and are consciously and unconsciously going “on strike.” They are dropping out of college, leaving the workforce and avoiding marriage and fatherhood at alarming rates. The trend is so pronounced that a number of books have been written about this “man-child” phenomenon, concluding that men have taken a vacation from responsibility simply because they can. But why should men participate in a system that seems to be increasingly stacked against them?As Men on Strike demonstrates, men aren’t dropping out because they are stuck in arrested development. They are instead acting rationally in response to the lack of incentives society offers them to be responsible fathers, husbands and providers. In addition, men are going on strike, either consciously or unconsciously, because they do not want to be injured by the myriad of laws, attitudes and hostility against them for the crime of happening to be male in the twenty-first century.

  ROMANZO VINCITORE DEL PREMIO STREGA 2018
«Così era finita Gerda Taro, per non aver voluto abbandonare il fronte quando non c’era più nessuna speranza, ed era rimasta ferita a morte come tanti altri, in una strada polverosa; lasciò nelle sue foto testimonianza dell’enorme delitto che era stata la guerra. Aveva dedicato la sua splendida vita a un degno compito, a una giusta causa persa.»Questo libro racconta la vita di questa ragazza ribelle, l'amore con Robert Capa, l'avventura di fotografare e la gioia di vivere nella Parigi degli anni Trenta.Il 1° agosto 1937 una sfilata piena di bandiere rosse attraversa Parigi. È il corteo funebre per Gerda Taro, la prima fotografa caduta su un campo di battaglia. Proprio quel giorno, avrebbe compiuto ventisette anni. Robert Capa, in prima fila, è distrutto: erano stati felici insieme, lui le aveva insegnato a usare la Leica e poi erano partiti tutti e due per la Guerra di Spagna. Nella folla seguono altri che sono legati a Gerda da molto prima che diventasse la ragazza di Capa: Ruth Cerf, l’amica di Lipsia, con cui ha vissuto i tempi più duri a Parigi dopo la fuga dalla Germania; Willy Chardack, che si è accontentato del ruolo di cavalier servente da quando l’irresistibile ragazza gli ha preferito Georg ­Kuritzkes, impegnato a combattere nelle Brigate Internazionali. Per tutti Gerda ­rimarrà una presenza più forte e viva della celebrata eroina antifascista: Gerda li ha spesso delusi e feriti, ma la sua gioia di ­vivere, la sua sete di libertà sono scintille capaci di riaccendersi anche a distanza di decenni. Basta una telefonata intercontinentale tra Willy e Georg, che si sentono per tutt’altro motivo, a dare l’avvio a un romanzo caleidoscopico, costruito sulle fonti originali, del quale Gerda è il cuore pulsante. È il suo battito a tenere insieme un flusso che allaccia epoche e luoghi lontani, restituendo vita alle istantanee di questi ragazzi degli anni Trenta alle prese con la crisi economica, l’ascesa del nazismo, l’ostilità verso i rifugiati che in Francia colpiva soprattutto chi era ebreo e di sinistra, come loro. Ma per chi l’ha amata, quella giovinezza resta il tempo in cui, finché Gerda è vissuta, tutto sembrava ancora possibile.",,Narratori della Fenice,,September 7th 2017,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Photography', 'Italy', 'Italian Literature', 'Womens', 'Novels', 'Spanish Civil War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']",,9788823518353,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503859151l/36134310._SY475_.jpg,2.75,"['Premio Strega (2018)', 'Premio Campiello Nominee (2018)', 'Premio Bagutta (2018)']",72.0,1.0,,36134310-la-ragazza-con-la-leica,,,,,57.0,1153.0,335,,Guanda,"['66', '211', '382', '355', '139']",,,[],,

Deze mensen, onder wie vele markante persoonlijkheden, vormden een clan die vol ondernemingslust, maar ook bezield van vooruitstrevende denkbeelden, in het wingewest Oost-Indië een beter (en voor de bevolking rechtvaardiger) systeem van landbouw en economie wilde invoeren. Zij pachtten woeste gronden en afgeschreven gouvernementscultures, en wisten in de loop van enkele tientallen jaren uitgestrekte plantages in het bergland van West-Java tot bloei te brengen.

For the group of ordinary men in the French Sixth Battalion, thrown together from all over France and longing for home, war is simply a matter of survival, lightened only by the arrival of their rations or a glimpse of a pretty girl or a brief reprieve in the hospital. Reminiscent of classics like Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Under Fire (originally published in French as La Feu) vividly evokes life in the trenches: the mud, stench, and monotony of waiting while constantly fearing for one's life in an infernal and seemingly eternal battlefield.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Henri Bergson,La Pensée et le mouvant: Essais et conférences,,French,,"La pensée et le mouvant est le dernier livre publié par Bergson, en 1934, à près de 75 ans ; et pourtant, il y exprime avec une surprise renouvelée, comme si elle venait de survenir, son intuition la plus originale (et cela, dès le titre même). Cest un livre qui est donc animé par une idée unique, une unité plus forte peut-être que jamais ; et pourtant, cest dabord un recueil dessais (le deuxième après Lénergie spirituelle de 1919), dont chacun (plus encore que dans le précédent) vaut comme une uvre décisive à part entière, dont certains (comme lIntroduction à la métaphysique) ont déjà marqué leur époque, et qui, enfin, ne sont pas reliés entre eux seulement par cette unité de principe, mais aussi par des tensions, non moins profondes. Ainsi Bergson resserre-t-il encore, plus que jamais, sa pensée ou son intuition, la prenant directement, pour la première fois, comme objet. Il restreint même, en apparence, la portée de ce recueil, en la limitant, dans lAvant-propos, à une réflexion, rétrospective, sur sa « méthode ».

Henri J.M. Nouwen,The Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery,,English,,"The Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery is Henri Nouwen's journal of his seven-month stay in the Abbey of the Genesee in upstate New York. His reflections on daily life with the Trappists are funny, wise, and often profound--resembling Kathleen Norris's The Cloister Walk, but a bit less thematically structured and more down to earth. Nouwen's goal is simply to record what it's like to pass the time in a cloistered community. He spends part of his stay there reading Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which helps awaken a hunger for a richer experience of life that he subsequently satisfies by learning to slow down. In his first week at the monastery, Nouwen writes, ""I have so many ideas I want to write about, so many books I want to read, so many skills I want to learn--motorcycle maintenance is now one of them--and so many things I want to say to others now or later, that I do not SEE that God is all around me and that I am always trying to see what is ahead, overlooking him who is so close."" Then, looking forward to being planted in one place among the Trappists, he writes, ""Maybe I need to get stuck,"" to learn to see God.

Henri Michaux,Plume: précédé de Lointain intérieur,,French,,"Dès ses premiers livres, Henri Michaux faisait entendre une voix profondément singulière. Et même si la parenté de ces textes avec les récits de Kafka (dans Plume notamment, publié en 1930) peut sembler évidente, leur force tient encore aujourd'hui du miracle : miracle de voir une langue retrouver sa jouvence, miracle de découvrir chaque mot remis à nu, débarrassé de tout artifice, y dévoilant un monde loin des apparences, une réalité secrète et souterraine. Toute sa vie, Michaux fut un grand solitaire, un aristocrate de la littérature. Mais à peine entrebâillées, les portes de ce Lointain intérieur projettent le lecteur dans un royaume de rêves et de terreurs, dont le fil se déroule suivant la logique implacable du désespoir. Ce monde brutal, pesant, écrase l'homme-plume avec une sauvagerie qui évoque les premiers âges de notre Histoire. La poésie de Michaux ne s'embarrasse pas de mélodies. Cri, clameur, puis rumeur, gonflements et sursauts, éruptions puis éboulements.

Henri Michaux,Las Grandes Pruebas Del Espíritu,,Spanish,,"En Occidente, Henri Michaux es sin duda quien mejor supo explorar —y pensar y reflexionar sobre— los laberintos mentales de las fantasías y del ensueño no sólo en los estados llamados normales de las personas, sino también en los estados alucinatorios provocados ya sea por los desórdenes mentales naturales, ya sea por los producidos por distintos tipos de droga. La fuerza que parece haber siempre sostenido a Henri Michaux en esas arriesgadas y graves incursiones allende la barrera de la “normalidad” es la misma que acostumbra a asistir al científico que se adentra en la investigación de lo desconocido : la incontenible curiosidad y el dominio de sí mismo con el fin de no sucumbir, de no perder pie, y poder así, desde el fondo del abismo, seguir siendo observador de la propia experiencia. Claro que semejante empresa no se consigue sin la convicción casi mística de encontrar más allá el conocimiento de algo diferente, de algo que trasciende. Estamos lejos, pues, con Michaux de la beatífica exaltación de los estados de pasiva contemplación o de paulatino e irreversible proceso de sumisión y esclavitud a los que, en la mayoría de los casos, encaminan las drogas. De hecho, Henri Michaux narra aquí esas pruebas a las que sometió su espíritu con la misma ausencia de prejuicios que cuando cuenta sus viajes por Asia y el Amazonas ( Un bárbaro en Asia , Tusquets, 1977, y Ecuador , Tusquets, 1983). Y es que viaja solo y sin guías ; cuenta únicamente con que “el ser humano es un vasto organismo en el que siempre hay una zona que vigila, que amasa, que ha aprendido, que ahora sabe, que sabe de modo diferente” .

Except that the number is not a phone sex service—it’s the revenge Cameron Kirkwood’s ex-boyfriend took on the uptight advertising executive after Cam forgot their anniversary and accidentally put him in the hospital. Needless to say, after thirty-nine disturbing calls seeking phone sex, Cameron is at the end of his tether and yells at his fortieth caller. What he doesn’t expect is for Riley to hit redial and yell right back.The argument helps both Cameron and Riley vent about their issues, and when they’ve calmed down, they decide to exchange numbers and talk again. From this decision springs a friendship that, over time, grows into a gentle romance—all over the phone, because Riley is too scared to meet Cam in person. Showing a potential boyfriend his disfigured face is the fastest way to get rejected, right? Even a month of scorching hot phone sex can’t change his mind, no matter how hard Cam tries to persuade him that with their phone chemistry, the sex would be so much better in person.Meanwhile, Cam is haunted by the scarred blond he seems to be seeing everywhere, and Riley can’t get the handsome brunet who always seems happy to see him out of his mind. It’s a shock to both men to realise that the guy they’re falling for over the phone is also the man who brightens their day with just a smile; but it’s one thing to let a stranger smile at you and quite another to let him close enough to see into your soul.

Scandalous in its day for its frank discussion of venereal disease and marriage infidelity, Ghosts remains to this day an intense psychological drama and sharp social criticism.Ghosts was written during the autumn of 1881 and was published in December of the same year. It was not performed in the theatre until May 1882, when a Danish touring company produced it in the Aurora Turner Hall in Chicago.

"Henrik Ibsen, William Archer (Translator), Микола Голубець (перекладач), Charles Archer (Translator)",Peer Gynt,,English,,"Among the masterpieces of world literature, this early verse drama by the celebrated Norwegian playwright humorously yet profoundly explores the virtues, vices, and follies common to all humanity — as represented in the person of Peer Gynt, a charming but irresponsible young peasant. Based on Norwegian folklore and Ibsen’s own imaginative inventions, the play relates the roguish life of the world-wandering Peer, who finds wealth and fame — but never happiness — although he is redeemed by love in the end. As the play opens the young farmer attends a wedding and meets Solveig, the woman who is eventually to be his salvation. However, the rascally Peer then kidnaps the bride and later abandons her in the wilderness. This dismal performance is followed by a string of adventures (many of which do not reflect well on Peer) in many lands. After these soul-chilling exploits, an old and embittered Peer returns to Norway, eventually finding solace in the arms of the faithful Solveig. Like other early Ibsen plays, such as Brand (1865) and Emperor and Galilean (1873), the work is imbued with poetic mysticism and romanticism, and in Peer we find a rebellious central character in search of an ultimate truth that always seems just out of reach. In this sense Peer can be seen as an alter ego of Ibsen himself, whose lifelong search for artistic and moral certainties resulted in the great later plays (Hedda Gabler, The Wild Duck, An Enemy of the People, etc.) upon which his reputation chiefly rests.

Elder Eyring writes, ""Yield your heart unto God. Ask him what it is he would have you do. Know that he will have prepared a way for you to do it, even under great difficulties. Ask him how he would have you share what you have with others, and you will feel his love. He lives and he loves you. He wants you to come home again.""

Henry Chadwick,The Church in Ancient Society,From Galilee to Gregory the Great,,Religion,"The Church in Ancient Society provides a full and enjoyable narrative history of the first six centuries of the Christian Church. Ancient Greek and Roman society had many gods and an addiction to astrology and divination. This introduction to the period traces the process by which Christianitychanged this and so provided a foundation for the modern world: the teaching of Jesus created a lasting community, which grew to command the allegiance of the Roman emperor. Christianity is discussed in relation to how it appeared to both Jews and pagans, and how its Christian doctrine and practicewere shaped in relation to Graeco-Roman culture and the Jewish matrix. Among the major figures discussed are Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, Julian the Apostate, Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine.Following a chronological approach, Henry Chadwick's clear exposition of important texts and theological debates in their historical context is unrivalled in detail. In particular, theological and ecclesial texts are examined in relation to the behaviour and beliefs of people who attended churchesand synagogues. Christians did not find agreement and unity easy and the author displays a distinctive concern for the factors - theological, personal, and political - which caused division in the church and prevented reconciliation. The emperors, however, began to foster unity for political reasonsand to choose monotheism. Finally, the Church captured the society.",,,,2003.0,,,,0199265771,9780199265770,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nLic1cabc8gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.21,,,,,,,,,,,,744.0,,,,14.0,,,,

He uses stories from well-known business leaders like Michael Dell and sports figures like Tiger Woods to illustrate each of these qualities. He shows us how people with integrity:Are able to connect with others and build trust Are oriented toward reality Finish well Embrace the negative Are oriented toward increase Have an understanding of the transcendentSuccess is not related to only talent or brains. There are a lot of bright, talented people who are never successful. And the most successful are not only the ones with the most talent.

A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God's will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren't boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries?

Henry Fielding,The History of Tom Jones,A Foundling,,Fiction,"Introduction and Notes by Doreen Roberts, Rutherford College, University of Kent at Canterbury. 'Tom Jones' is widely regarded as one of the first and most influential English novels. It is certainly the funniest. Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness. This 'comic, epic poem in prose' will make the modern reader laugh as much as it did his forbears. Its biting satire finds an echo in today's society, for as Doris Lessing recently remarked ""This country becomes every day more like the eighteenth century, full of thieves and adventurers, rogues and a robust, unhypocritical savagery side-by-side with people lecturing others on morality"". AUTHOR: Henry Fielding (1707-1754) was an English novelist; building on the foundations put in place by Daniel Defoe and others, he was a major contributor to the form of the modern novel. He wrote four novels, of which the most enduring is 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling', widely regarded as among the finest books ever written.",,,,1992.0,,,,1853260215,9781853260216,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xViaKR7HSG8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.74,,,,,,,,,,,,734.0,,,,555.0,,,,

His restlessness is not understood by Mary, who has to endure the constant shattering of her security as Richard desperately attempts to free himself; his attempts finally plunge them into poverty.

Henry Hazlitt,Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,,English,,"A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",,,10/28/46,1979,[],Paperback,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'History', 'Money', 'Audiobook']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565397589l/3028._SX318_.jpg,4.21,[],618.0,7.0,,3028.Economics_in_One_Lesson,,,,,94.0,14974.0,218,,Three Rivers Press,"['7285', '4658', '2152', '592', '287']",,,[],,

After an absence of more than twenty years, James had returned for a visit to his native country; what he found there filled him with profound dismay. In The Ivory Tower, his last book, the characteristic pattern underlying so much of his fiction—in which American “innocence” is transformed by its encounter with European “experience”—receives a new twist: raised abroad, the hero comes home to America to confront, as James puts it, “the black and merciless things that are behind the great possessions.” James died in 1916 with the first three books of The Ivory Tower completed. He also left behind a “treatment,” in which he charted the further progress of his story.

Henry James,The Aspern Papers,,English,,"In this classic 1888 novella, an anonymous narrator relates his obsessive quest to acquire some letters and other private documents that once belonged to the deceased Romantic poet Jeffrey Aspern.

Henry Miller,"Mémoires, Plaidoiries Et Documents",,,Biography & Autobiography,"Some writers attempt to conceal the literary influences which have shaped their thinking - but not Henry Miller. In The Books in My Life he shares the thrills of discovery that many kinds of books have brought to a keenly curious and questioning mind. Some of Miller's favorite writers are the giants whom most of us revere - authors such as Dostoeyvsky, Boccaccio, Walt Whitman, James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Lao-Tse. To them he brings fresh and penetrating insights. But many are lesser-known figures: Krishnamurti, the prophet-sage; the French contemporaries Blaise Cendrars and Jean Giono; Richard Jeffries, who wrote The Story of My Heart ; the Welshman John Cowper Powys; and scores of others. The Books in My Life contains some fine autobiographical chapters, too. Miller describes his boyhood in Brooklyn, when he devoured the historical stories of G. A. Henty and the romances of Rider Haggard. He tells of the men and women whom he regards as living books"": Lou Jacobs, W. E. B. DuBois, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and others. He offers his reminiscences of the New York Theatre in the early 1900's - including plays such as Alias Jimmy Valentine and Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model . And finally, in Miller's best vein of humor, he provides a satiric chapter on bathroom reading. In an appendix, Miller lists the hundred books that have influenced him most.

I wanted todocument it and create a book that brought the whole thing to a boil and see where it left me off. In the summer of 1995, I finished the book and startedto edit.

Hastening to join three fellow Magi for the long journey into Judaea, he paused to help a dying man and was left behind. And so Artaban began his pilgrimage alone, striking out not toward the realization of his life's deepest longing, as he hoped, but only toward misfortune and suffering.

He wrote the first American translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets. He established his literary career by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems. About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that an influential trustee, Benjamin Orr, had been so impressed Longfellow's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish and Italian. When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He began publishing his poetry, including Voices of the Night in 1839 and Ballads and Other Poems, which included his famous poem The Village Blacksmith, in 1841.

"Henry Watson Fowler, Robert W. Burchfield (Editor)",The New Fowler's Modern English Usage,,English,,"First published in 1926, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is one of the most celebrated reference books of the twentieth century. Commonly known as ""Fowler,"" after its inimitable author, H.W. Fowler, it has sold more than a million copies and maintained a devoted following over seven decades, in large part because of its charming blend of information and good humor, delivered in the voice of a genial if somewhat idiosyncratic schoolmaster. ""Reading Fowler,"" William F. Buckley once noted, ""provides instruction and knowledge and direction, but the whole of it is a sensual delight."" And Jessica Mitford wrote that Fowler's style ""has afforded me endless amusement and instruction through my very long life."" The first place to turn for sensible advice on the thorny issues of grammar, meaning, and pronunciation, ""Fowler"" is one of those rare reference books that can also be read simply for pleasure. Now this classic is available in a new edition--the first major revision since Fowler's original. Rewritten, updated, and expanded to take into account the vast linguistic changes of the past three-quarters of a century, here are thousands of alphabetically arranged entries, offering advice and background information on all aspects of the English language, from grammar to spelling to literary style. This masterful revision has been carried out by Robert Burchfield, hailed by The Chicago Tribune as ""the greatest living lexicographer."" In his hands, the MEU has retained its beloved traits--accessibility, authority, and (not least) personality--while acquiring new ones, most notably, up-to-the-minute currency. As in ""Fowler,"" the new edition is a cornucopia of information on such troublesome areas as the plural form of foreign words (adagio, curriculum, memorandum, virus); related or like-sounding words (affect/effect, continual/continuous); rarely encountered literary terms (alcaics, alexandrine, arsis); and unusual inflected forms (for instance, taxi, taxis, taxiing). But there are also many innovations. Burchfield, who spent decades working on the Oxford English Dictionary, has introduced the OED's historical approach to the MEU, providing fascinating details on how and when new usages entered the language. In addition, he has combed novels, newspapers, and magazines to replenish the book's many illustrative sentences with new examples from the 1980s and 1990s, taken from such sources as The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, and from such writers as Saul Bellow, John Updike, Kingsley and Martin Amis, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively. The new MEU also covers much more of the English-speaking world than did ""Fowler""--including not only the United Kingdom and the United States, but also Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and elsewhere--and pronunciation is now given in the International Phonetic Alphabet, with an easy-to-consult guide given across each double-page spread.  For seventy years, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage has supplied readers with information, guidance, and amusement. This major revision provides an MEU for the next century: a completely up-to-date work based on the immense databases of the Oxford English Dictionary, providing the same insightful, authoritative, and lively coverage that has long made ""Fowler"" a synonym for correct English.",,,1926,December 19th 1996,[],Hardcover,"['Reference', 'Writing', 'Language', 'Nonfiction', 'Dictionaries', 'Linguistics', 'Classics', 'School', 'Business', 'Humor']",,9780198691266,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387706121l/109656.jpg,4.22,[],28.0,1.0,,109656.The_New_Fowler_s_Modern_English_Usage,,,,,96.0,1021.0,896,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['498', '310', '173', '22', '18']",,,[],,

The birth is especially remarkable: fifteen-year-old Emmeline, alone in the jungle, loses consciousness and awakes to find a baby boy on the ground near her.

Henryk Sienkiewicz,Quo Vadis,,,Christian fiction,"Henryk Sienkiewicz (1846-1916) won the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature. A brilliant Polish writer and patriot, he is possibly best known abroad for his monumental historical epic Quo Vadis that portrays the vibrant and dissonant combination of cruel excesses and decadence of Rome during the reign of the corrupt Emperor Nero and the high faith of the emerging era of early Christianity. Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero, is a love story of Marcus Vinicius, a passionate young Roman tribune, and Lygia Callina, a beautiful and gentle Christian maiden of royal Lygian descent and a hostage of Rome, raised in a patrician home. At first Marcus, a typical aristocratic Roman libertine of his time, has no notion of love and merely desires Lygia with erotic animalistic intensity.

Henryk Sienkiewicz,Without Dogma,,English,,"In Without dogma Sienkiewicz decided to move away from the historical novel genre that gave him fame and write about contemporary issues, being the problem of late nineteenth-century man, devoid of moral principles and lasting purpose in life, to which he could pursue. He wrote a psychological novel, in which the romantic plot was a pretext for showing the hero's mental states and self-analysis of his experiences. Due to its subject and the lack of explicit condemnation of the main character, this book aroused heated discussions and sparked allegations of a-morality.

Henryk Sienkiewicz,Ogniem i mieczem,,Polish,,"Ogniem i mieczem, pierwsza z powieści tworzących Trylogię, przedstawia dzieje Polski w dobie powstania Chmielnickiego (1648-1654).

Jednoznacznie negatywną kwalifikację moralną przypisał Sienkiewicz zbuntowanym Kozakom, przedstawionym jako żądni krwi barbarzyńcy, zaś Polaków przedstawił jako odważnych obrońców ojczyzny i prawych, przestrzegających rycerskiego kodeksu żołnierzy. W czarno-biały schemat wpisani zostali także – wbrew prawdzie historycznej – przywódcy walczących stron.

"Henryk Sienkiewicz, Alicia Tyszkiewicz (Translator), Miroslaw Lipinski (Editor)",The Teutonic Knights,,English,,"The Teutonic Knights is an epic of medieval times and national destiny, ranking as one of the highest achievements from the pen of Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Nobel Prize winner for Literature in 1905. The novel follows the adventures of Macko, a resourceful and wise veteran of war, and his young nephew, Zbyszko, the symbol of a maturing nation, as they struggle, along with the unified peoples of Poland and Lithuania, against the oppressive religious military order, the Teutonic Knights. Among the many memorable characters are Jurand, a merciless, bitter fighter consumed with revenge; his daughter, the innocent Danusia, a girl of twelve who must face the barbarity of the German knighthood; the strong-willed Jagienka, equally adept at shooting a crossbow or administering an estate; Hlawa, a Czech squire of noble birth who is as quick with his wit as he is with his axe; Sanderus, a peddler of religious relics and indulgences whose earthly cravings seem greater than any spiritual needs. A host of other memorable characters fills the canvas set against lush, almost magical forests, dangerous marshes replete with tales of human heads walking on spider legs, winter blizzards that blanket the world in a white wonderland - all at once beautiful and foreboding. Splendid castles are described here, court hunts, single combats that test valor and strength. The customs of knights with their code of honor and feelings of love are adroitly explored. The entirety culminates in one of the most important battles in medieval history, the Battle of Grunwald. The Teutonic Knights was published in America in 1900 in various competing translations of erratic quality. Not until 1943 did a translation worthy of this masterpiece appear, but unfortunately its release was limited to Great Britain. It is this translation that has been revised and edited by Miroslaw Lipinski with an eye for both fluidity in the English language and fidelity to the original Polish.",The Knights of the Cross or Krzyżacy #1-4,Illustrated Edition,10/30/99,October 1st 1995,"['Danusia Jurandówna', 'Zbyszko z Bogdańca', 'Jurand ze Spychowa', 'Maćko z Bogdańca', 'Jagienka ze Zgorzelic']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Polish Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'School', 'Poland', 'Medieval', 'War', 'Novels']",,9780781804332,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387715014l/759212.jpg,3.38,[],133.0,2.0,,759212.The_Teutonic_Knights,,,,,76.0,4496.0,786,,Hippocrene Books,"['943', '1306', '1185', '648', '414']",,,[],,
"Henryk Sienkiewicz, W.S. Kuniczak (Translator)",Quo Vadis,,English,,"This glorious saga unfolds against the backdrop of ancient Rome--from the Forum to the Coliseum, from banquet halls to summer retreats in Naples, from the luxurious houses of the nobility to the hovels of the poor, Quo Vadis richly depicts a place and time still captivating to the modern imagination. This radiant translation by W.S. Kuniczak restores the original glory and richness of master storyteller Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic tale.Set at a turning point in history (A.D. 54-68), as Christianity replaces the era of corruption and immorality that marked Nero's Rome, Quo Vadis abounds with compelling characters, including:Vinicius, the proud centurion who has fallen deeply in love with a mysterious young woman who disappears the night they meet;Ligia, the elusive beauty. Vinicius will not easily win her love, for she is a Christian, one of the group of dedicated believers led by the apostle Peter. Christians are rare in pagan, hedonistic Rome, and suffer great persecution;Petronius, uncle to Vinicius, an elegant, witty courtier who scoffs at love and religion but finds his nephew's passion charming; andNero himself, enemy of all Christians, a despotic emperor who plunges Rome deeper and deeper into depravity. The decadence of his banquets is staggering; and even worse, his mad laughter is heard echoing in the amphitheater as gladiators duel to the death.As Nero's appalling plans for the Christians become ever clearer, time appears to be running out for the young lovers. Vinicius must come to understand the true meaning of Ligia's religion before it is too late.Grand in scope and ambition, Quo Vadis explores the themes of love, desire and profound moral courage. Lavish descriptions, vivid dialogue and brilliantly drawn characters make this one of the world's greatest epics. Beloved by children and adults the world over, Quo Vadis has been the subject of five films, two of them in English.",,,10/28/94,2006,"['Nero (emperor)', 'Lygia', 'Marcus Vinicius', 'Paul of Tarsus', 'Ursus', 'Petronius', 'Chilo Chilonides', 'Simon Peter']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Polish Literature', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Christian', 'Novels']",,9780781805506,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340709653l/538845.jpg,4.16,[],4867.0,63.0,,538845.Quo_Vadis,,,,,94.0,26430.0,589,,Hippocrene Books,"['12141', '8377', '4265', '1198', '449']",,,['Rome (Italy)'],,

Herbert P. Bix,Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan,,English,,"Winner of the Pulitzer PrizeIn this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.",,,08/22/00,September 4th 2001,['Hirohito'],Paperback,"['History', 'Japan', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'World History', 'War', 'Asia', 'Japanese History', 'Japanese Literature']",,9780060931308,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407707626l/93959.jpg,3.85,"['Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (2001)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography/Autobiography (2000)', 'Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2000)']",89.0,1.0,,93959.Hirohito_and_the_Making_of_Modern_Japan,,,,,92.0,2351.0,832,,Harper Perennial,"['636', '960', '567', '134', '54']",,,[],,
Herbert Read,The Green Child,,English,,"First published in 1935, The Green Child is Herbert Read's only novel. But if he had written nothing else, this one inspired book would insure his fame. It is a Utopian novel, a unique blend of reality and fantasy which moves from the English countryside to the South American pampas and then to a mysterious and eternal underground of caves.In genre The Green Child is perhaps closest to the French conte philosophique, yet the word ""philosophical"" suggests the abstruse, whereas this is a very moving and exciting story, alive with the poetry of living, and, at the same time, with a strange kind of other-worldly suspense. In his introduction Kenneth Rexroth speaks of the book's ""unearthly, hypnotic radiance,"" and Graham Greene has said of it: ""here Read conveys the private sense of glory, the same sense of glory that impelled Christian writers to picture the City of God.""

Herberto Helder,Servidões,,Portuguese,,"Publicado em 2013 com grande sucesso — a edição esgotou em poucos dias — este livro foi unanimemente considerado pela crítica como o livro do ano. Dele escreveu Luís Miguel Queirós, dizendo que desde logo aquilo que impressiona o leitor «[…] é a assustadora criatividade de que Herberto dá provas aos 80 anos, mas não é menos notável que estes seus últimos livros, com tudo o que trazem de novo, e por vezes até de exuberantemente novo, nem por isso deixem de manter com a sua obra anterior uma coerência sem falhas.». Rosa Maria Martelo disse que «Nestes tempos de descalabro social e político, haver um novo livro de Herberto Helder é um rompimento que apetece celebrar. E que impressiona por muitas razões — desde logo pela coragem de olhar a morte.». O semanário Expresso descreveu «Servidões» como um «livro de uma beleza convulsa, atravessado por explosões de energia visceral. É poesia ""em estado de milagre"", escrita pelo maior poeta português vivo.»«como se atira o dardo com o corpo todo,com a eternidade em não mais que nada,e depois a abolição do tempo,e então o que respira no corpo passa à vara,e o que respira na vara passa depois à ponta,tu não, tu já respiraste tudo pelo dardo fora,mudo e cego e surdo,e és um só ponto do alvo onde respiras todo,e tudo respira nesse ponto,em ti, veia da terra, ohsangue sensível»",,,,2013,[],Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Portugal']",,9789723716962,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369703711l/17983645.jpg,4.56,[],72.0,1.0,,17983645-servid-es,,,,,97.0,121.0,128,,Assírio & Alvim,"['80', '33', '4', '4', '0']",,,[],,

Herbjørg Wassmo,Dina's Book,,English,,"On the scale of Gone with the Wind and War and Peace, this grand, sweeping epic will enthrall readers just as Dina bewitches everyone she meets.Set in Norway in the mid-nineteenth century, Dina's Book presents an extraordinary heroine. Beautiful, eccentric, and tempestuous, Dina carries a terrible burden: at the age of five she accidentally causes her mother's death. Blamed by her father and banished to a farm, she grows up untamed and untaught. Nobody leads the child through her grief, and the accident remains a gruesome riddle of death. Her guilt becomes her obsession: her unforgiving mother haunts her every day.After several years of exile, and at the insistence of the local pastor, her father takes Dina back. By now she has become like a wolf cub. Her father has remarried, to a younger woman whom she detests, and a strict discipline begins. A tutor is brought in; coarse language is replaced by polite conversation, climbing to the top of the trees by music. But the efforts have little effect. Private and closely guarded, Dina nonetheless is able to manipulate those around her, while her unconventional behavior and erotic power both enchant and ensnare.At sixteen Dina is married off to wealthy fifty-year-old landowner Jacob, a friend of her father who has fallen completely under her spell. Jacob dies under mysterious circumstances, and Dina becomes mute. When finally she emerges from her trauma, she runs Jacob's estate with an iron hand. But still Dina wrestles with her two unappeased ghosts: Jacob and her mother.

Hergé,Tintin au Congo,,French,,"Après son premier périple en Union Soviétique, c'est pour l'Afrique que s'embarquent cette fois-ci notre héros à la légendaire houpette et son chien. Les circonstances feront de Tintin un sorcier chez les Babaorum, et il déjouera les projets d'une bande de gangsters sans foi ni loi dont l'objectif est de s'accaparer toute la production de diamants au congo belge.Pour le désormais célèbre reporter du petit XXeme, les aventures ne font que commencer !Le 10 janvier 1929, un jeune reporter fait son apparition dans Le Petit Vingtième, le supplément pour enfants du quotidien belge Le XXe siècle. Son nom ? Tintin. Accompagné de Milou, un jeune chien blanc, il part pour la ""Russie soviétique"". Son créateur, un certain Georges Remi, signe Hergé, pseudonyme inspiré par ses initiales. Après ce premier voyage en Russie, qui donne naissance à l'album Tintin chez les Soviets, le jeune reporter s'envole pour l'Afrique (Tintin au Congo), puis pour l'Amérique. Mais c'est Le Lotus bleu, publié dans Le Petit Vingtième dès août 1934, qui marque un tournant important dans l'œuvre d'Hergé. Celui-ci, après avoir rencontré Tchang Tchong-Jen, jeune étudiant chinois qui lui a ouvert les yeux sur l'Asie, va désormais se soucier de rigueur documentaire. Il va aussi s'efforcer de faire passer dans ses histoires un message d'humanisme et de tolérance. Le succès de son reporter à la houppe ne va cesser de grandir. Hergé lui fait parcourir le monde. Il teinte ses aventures d'onirisme (L'Étoile mystérieuse), flirte avec le surnaturel (Les Sept Boules de cristal), l'expédie même sur la lune.Il donne à Tintin des compagnons d'aventure qui vont prendre une place essentielle : les Dupont/d (Les Cigares du pharaon), le capitaine Haddock (Le Crabe aux pinces d'or), le professeur Tournesol (Le Secret de la Licorne) ou Bianca Castafiore (Le Sceptre d'Ottokar). Hergé n'hésite pas à jouer avec ses personnages : Les Bijoux de la Castafiore montrent un Tintin dépassé par les événements, loin de son image traditionnelle. Jusqu'à l'œuvre ultime, laissée inachevée par la mort d'Hergé en mars 1983 : Tintin et l'alph-art, dont la dernière case montre le héros en bien fâcheuse posture...Tintin a su séduire les jeunes comme les adultes. Grâce à la lisibilité de la narration et du dessin, la justesse des dialogues, le sens du rebondissement et de l'intrigue... Mais aussi le souffle de l'aventure, de l'amitié et de la générosité.

Tintin, Calculus and Haddock soon become embroiled in the accusations, and, travelling to San Theodoros to clear their names, find themselves caught in a trap laid by their old enemy, Colonel Sponsz, who has been sent by the East Bloc nation of Borduria to assist Tapioca. Sponsz has concocted the conspiracy of which Tintin and his friends are accused in a plot to wreak revenge upon them for humiliating him in The Calculus Affair. Escaping, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus join Alcazar and his small band of guerrillas, the Picaros, in the jungle near an Arumbaya Indian village.Meanwhile, in a show trial orchestrated by Sponsz, Castafiore is sentenced to life imprisonment and the Thompsons are ordered to be executed by firing squad. Tintin enlists Alcazar's help in freeing his friends, but upon arrival at his jungle headquarters, finds that Alcazar's men have become demoralised drunkards since Tapioca started dropping copious quantities of alcohol near their camp. Additionally, Alcazar is continually henpecked by his shrewish wife Peggy, who nags him constantly about his failure to achieve a successful revolution. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a pill which will make alcohol unpalatable to anyone who ingests it (which he proves to have tested on Haddock, much to the latter's ire). Tintin offers to use the pill to cure the Picaros of their alcoholism if Alcazar agrees to make the overthrow of Tapioca bloodless. Alcazar reluctantly agrees, and as his men are cured, Jolyon Wagg arrives with his musical troupe the Jolly Follies, who intend to perform at the upcoming carnival in San Theodoros. Alcazar — with a little advice from Tintin — launches an assault on Tapioca's palace during the carnival by 'borrowing' the troupe's costumes and sneaking his men into the capital. He topples Tapioca, but on Tintin's urging, does not execute him, as is tradition; Tapioca is instead forced to publicly surrender his powers to Alcazar and is exiled, while Sponsz is sent back to Borduria.Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson are due to be shot on the same day as the carnival (although as naive as ever in their observations, the detectives show courage by refusing to be blindfolded). Tintin and Haddock reach the state prison in time to prevent the executions from taking place. Castafiore, her maid and her pianist are also released, and Alcazar can finally give his wife the palace he has promised. With everything back in order (or not), Tintin and his friends leave. As they fly home, Tintin and Haddock express gratitude about being able to go home, showing a more weary attitude towards travel than in earlier books.The second to last panel shows a final, skeptical political message: as under Tapioca, the city slums are filled with wretched, starving people and patrolled by indifferent police. Nothing is different, except that a Viva Tapioca sign has been changed to read Viva Alcazar, demonstrating Hergé's view that even if regimes change, conditions do not improve.",Tintin #23,,10/30/76,August 27th 1993,"['Milou', 'Tintin', 'Captain Archibald Haddock', 'Thomson & Thompson', 'Bianca Castafiore', 'Snowy', 'General Alcazar', 'Professor Calculus']",Paperback,"['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Bande Dessinée', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comic Book', 'France', 'Mystery']",,9780416851700,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327959072l/146160.jpg,4.02,[],177.0,2.0,,146160.Tintin_and_the_Picaros,,,,,95.0,9828.0,64,,Methuen Publishing,"['3461', '3595', '2319', '406', '47']",,,[],,

"Hergé, Michael Turner (Translator), Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper (Translator)",King Ottokar's Sceptre,,English,,"Tintin finds a lost briefcase and returns it to the owner, Professor Hector Alembick, who is a sigilographer, an expert on seals. He shows Tintin his collection of seals, including one which belonged to the Syldavian King Ottokar IV. Tintin then discovers that he and Alembick are under surveillance by some strange men. Tintin's flat is even bombed in an attempt to kill him. Suspecting a Syldavian connection, Tintin offers to accompany Alembick to Syldavia for research.On the plane Tintin begins to suspect his companion. The Alembick travelling with him doesn't smoke and doesn't seem to need the spectacles he wears, while the Alembick he first met smoked heavily and had very poor eyesight. During a layover, Tintin fakes a fall and grabs Alembick's beard, thinking it is false and Alembick is an imposter. However, it is (for Alembick) painfully real. Tintin decides to let the matter drop but then, while flying over Syldavia, it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out, landing in a haywagon.Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the sceptre of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia, the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to abdicate. Every year he rides in a parade during St. Vladimir's Day carrying it, while the people sing the national anthem. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning King, Muskar XII, despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick, the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing.Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen proves bad and painful for them. Later on, Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre, but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise, which allowed him to catapult it out of the castle into a nearby forest.Searching the forest, Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country, Borduria. Following them all the way to the border, he wrests the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for the taking over of Syldavia by their long-time political rival, Borduria.Tintin steals a Me-109 from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned ""Anschluss"" of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot.Meanwhile the Interior Minister informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses, acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to abdicate when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket).Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by Müsstler, leader of the Iron Guard, a local political party. The King takes action by having Müsstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response, the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border, though he stresses his own country's ""desire for peace"" and criticises Syldavia's ""strange"" behaviour.The next day is St. Vladimir's Day and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican, the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that, in a classic Ruritanian plot device, Professor Alembick is one of a pair of identical twins: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place.Tintin and Snowy return home by a flying boat with Thomson and Thompson, who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight.

Herman Koch,The Dinner,,English,,"An internationally bestselling phenomenon: the darkly suspenseful, highly controversial tale of two families struggling to make the hardest decision of their lives - all over the course of one meal. It's a summer's evening in Amsterdam, and two couples meet at a fashionable restaurant for dinner. Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse - the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened. Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. The two boys are united by their accountability for a single horrific act; an act that has triggered a police investigation and shattered the comfortable, insulated worlds of their families. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children. As civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple show just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love. Tautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, The Dinner promises to be the topic of countless dinner party debates. Skewering everything from parenting values to pretentious menus to political convictions, this novel reveals the dark side of genteel society and asks what each of us would do in the face of unimaginable tragedy.",,,01/28/09,February 12th 2013,[],Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime']",,B008ZPGDX0,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1530713598l/40718205._SY475_.jpg,3.24,"['Publieksprijs voor het Nederlandse Boek (2009)', 'PEN Translation Prize Nominee for Sam Garrett (2014)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2014)', 'Metų verstinė knyga Nominee (2015)']",519.0,6.0,,40718205-the-dinner,,,,,78.0,133397.0,306,,Hogarth,"['14235', '40914', '48632', '21734', '7882']",,,['Amsterdam (Netherlands)'],,

Here, they are collected along with 19 other stories in a beautifully redesigned collection that represents the best short work of an American master.As Warner Berthoff writes in his introduction to this volume, ""It is hard to think of a major novelist or storyteller who is not also a first-rate entertainer . . . a master, according to choice, of high comedy, of one or another robust species of expressive humour, or of some special variety of the preposterous, the grotesque, the absurd. And Melville, certainly, is no exception. A kind of vigorous supervisory humour is his natural idiom as a writer, and one particular attraction of his shorter work is the fresh further display it offers of this prime element in his literary character.""",,,,2004.0,,,,0060586540,9780060586546,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6WgbDCDIe-QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.02,,,,,,,,,,,,512.0,,,,401.0,,,,

Central to the selection are several self-contained passages from Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage to the Holy Land (1876), a book-length work that Warren calls ""an important document of our modernity ... in fact, a precursor to The Waste Land, with the same central image, the same flickering contrasts of the past and the present, the same charade of belief and unbelief.""""

Herman Wouk,The Hope,,English,,"Herman Wouk is one of this century's great historical novelists, whose peerless talent for capturing the human drama of landmark world events has earned him worldwide acclaim. In The Hope, his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel. In the grand, epic style of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, The Hope plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of comic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed ""strawberry business"" in The Caine Mutiny. First to last The Hope is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank. In the love stories of these four men, the author of Marjorie Morningstar has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school. With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century.",The Hope and the Glory #1,,10/30/93,December 1st 1993,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Israel', 'War', 'Jewish', 'Historical', 'Judaism', 'Novels', 'Military Fiction', 'Cultural']",,9780316955195,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310621400l/2197408.jpg,4.15,[],104.0,2.0,,2197408.The_Hope,,,,,95.0,3312.0,693,,Little Brown and Company,"['1406', '1199', '557', '113', '37']",,,[],,

This necessitates a brutal shipboard court-martial that threatens by turns to clear or condemn him. In adapting his novel for the theater, Herman Wouk focused on the heart of the story: the trial and the man at its center.

Daß dieses im Herbst 1917 vollendete Buch erst im Juni 1919, ein halbes Jahr nach Kriegsende, veröffentlicht wurde, lag an der Unbekanntheit des Verfassers. Denn Hesse hatte das Manuskript dem Verlag als das Erstlingswerk eines kranken jungen Dichters empfohlen, des zeitkritischen Poeten Emil Sinclair, der bisher nur in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften durch pazifistische Mahnrufe und Erzählungen aufgefallen war (die gleichfalls von Hesse stammten). Doch trotz des Inkognitos erlebte das Buch eine geradezu stürmische Aufnahme und wurde noch im Erscheinungsjahr mit dem Fontane-Preis für das beste Erstlingswerk eines Nachwuchsautors ausgezeichnet. Thomas Mann verglich die elektrisierende Wirkung des Buches mit der von Goethes Werther, da es »mit unheimlicher Genauigkeit den Nerv der Zeit traf und eine ganze Jugend, die wähnte aus ihrer Mitte sei ihr ein Künder ihres tiefsten Lebens entstanden, zu dankbarem Entzücken hinriß«.

Such views earned him the labels 'traitor' and 'viper' in Germany, but after World War II he was moved to reiterate his beliefs in another series of essays and letters.

Everything got more complicated when, among the people he met during the first two days after his arrival, nobody spoke English.  However, he has to fight for the truth and for his dignity at all costs. Fortunately, he creates a strong bond with a young lawyer who believes in him and decides to support him with all his soul.

"Herta Müller, Philip Boehm (Translator)",The Hunger Angel,,English,,"It was an icy morning in January 1945 when the patrol came for seventeen-year-old Leo Auberg to deport him to a camp in the Soviet Union. Leo would spend the next five years in a coke processing plant, shoveling coal, lugging bricks, mixing mortar, and battling the relentless calculus of hunger that governed the labor colony: one shovel load of coal is worth one gram of bread.In her new novel, Nobel laureate Herta Müller calls upon her unique combination of poetic intensity and dispassionate precision to conjure the distorted world of the labor camp in all its physical and moral absurdity. She has given Leo the language to express the inexpressible, as hunger sharpens his senses into an acuity that is both hallucinatory and profound. In scene after disorienting scene, the most ordinary objects accrue tender poignancy as they acquire new purpose—a gramophone box serves as a suitcase, a handkerchief becomes a talisman, an enormous piece of casing pipe functions as a lovers' trysting place. The heart is reduced to a pump, the breath mechanized to the rhythm of a swinging shovel, and coal, sand, and snow have a will of their own. Hunger becomes an insatiable angel who haunts the camp day and night, but also a bare-knuckled sparring partner, delivering blows that keep Leo feeling the rawest connection to life.Müller has distilled Leo's struggle into words of breathtaking intensity that take us on a journey far beyond the Gulag and into the depths of one man's soul.",,,10/28/09,April 24th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Romania', 'Germany', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Russia']",,9780805093018,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333549068l/13165142.jpg,3.9,"['BTBA Best Translated Book Award Nominee for Fiction shortlist (2013)', 'Magnesia Litera for Translation (Litera za překladovou knihu) (2011)', 'Deutscher Buchpreis (German Book Prize) Nominee for Shortlist (2009)', 'Franz-Werfel-Menschenrechtspreis (2009)', 'Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2013)', 'ALTA National Translation Award for Prose Poetry for Philip Boehm (2013)', 'Mikael Agricola -palkinto (2011)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2014)', 'Metų verstinė knyga Nominee (2010)']",409.0,5.0,,13165142-the-hunger-angel,,,,,91.0,4278.0,304,,Metropolitan Books,"['1381', '1571', '924', '312', '90']",,,"['Sibiu, Transylvania (Romania)', 'Horlivka (Ukraine)']",,

Hesiod,Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns,,,Poetry,"Winner of the 2005 Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets. In Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns, highly acclaimed poet and translator Daryl Hine brings to life the words of Hesiod and the world of Archaic Greece. While most available versions of these early Greek writings are rendered in prose, Hine's illuminating translations represent these early classics as they originally appeared, in verse. Since prose was not invented as a literary medium until well after Hesiod's time, presenting these works as poems more closely approximates not only the mechanics but also the melody of the originals. This volume includes Hesiod's Works and Days and Theogony, two of the oldest non-Homeric poems to survive from antiquity. Works and Days is in part a farmer's almanac—filled with cautionary tales and advice for managing harvests and maintaining a good work ethic—and Theogony is the earliest comprehensive account of classical mythology—including the names and genealogies of the gods (and giants and monsters) of Olympus, the sea, and the underworld. Hine brings out Hesiod's unmistakable personality; Hesiod's tales of his escapades and his gritty and persuasive voice not only give us a sense of the author's own character but also offer up a rare glimpse of the everyday life of ordinary people in the eighth century BCE. In contrast, the Homeric Hymns are more distant in that they depict aristocratic life in a polished tone that reveals nothing of the narrators' personalities. These hymns (so named because they address the deities in short invocations at the beginning and end of each) are some of the earliest examples of epyllia, or short stories in the epic manner in Greek. This volume unites Hine's skillful translations of the Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns—along with Hine's rendering of the mock-Homeric epic The Battle of the Frogs and the Mice—in a stunning pairing of these masterful classics.",,,,2005.0,,,,0226329658,9780226329659,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h4JiAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.72,,,,,,,,,,,,230.0,,,,32.0,,,,

In contrast, Works & Days is a compendium of moral & practical advice on husbandry, throwing unique light on archaic Greek society. As well as offering the earliest known sources for the myths of Pandora, Prometheus & the Golden Age, his poetry provides a valuable account of the ethics & superstitions of the society in which he lived. Unlike Homer, Hesiod writes about himself & his family. He stands out as the 1st personality in European literature. This new translation, by a leading expert on the Hesiodic poems combines accuracy with readability. It's accompanied by an introduction & explanatory notes.

Justice Holis took Weasel off the streets, gave him a home, a job as his clerk, and a key to his house.

Hilary Mantel (Goodreads Author),Wolf Hall / Bring Up the Bodies,,English,,"A two-ebook edition of Hilary Mantel' s bestselling novels: Wolf Hall, winner of the Man Booker Prize 2009, and Bring Up the Bodies, winner of the Man Booker Prize 2012.Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, the first two instalments in Hilary Mantel' s Tudor trilogy, have gathered readers and praise in equal and enormous measure. They have been credited with elevating historical fiction to new heights and animating a period of history many thought too well known to be made fresh.Through the eyes and ears of Thomas Cromwell, the books' narrative prism, we are shown Tudor England, the court of King Henry VIII. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events.In Wolf Hall we witness Cromwell' s rise, beginning as clerk to Cardinal Wolsey, Henry' s chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. He is soon to become his successor. By 1535, when the action of Bring Up the Bodies begins, Cromwell is Chief Minister to Henry, his fortunes having risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry' s second wife. Anne' s days, though, are marked. Cromwell watches as the king falls in love with silent, plain Jane Seymour, sensing what Henry' s affection will mean for his queen, for England, and for himself.",,,10/16/12,October 30th 2012,"['Anne Boleyn', 'Thomas More', 'Catherine of Aragon', 'Jane Seymour', 'Mary Boleyn', 'Thomas Howard', 'Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk', 'Thomas Wyatt', 'Francis I of France', 'Thomas Cromwell', 'Thomas Seymour', 'Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset', 'Thomas Cranmer', 'Walter Cromwell', 'Morgan Williams', 'Elizabeth Wykys', 'Henry Wykys', 'Johane Williamson', 'John Williamson', 'Alice Wellyfed', 'Bet Cromwell', 'Rafe Sadler', 'Thomas Avery', 'Helen Barre', 'Dick Purser', 'Thomas Wolsey', 'George Cavendish', 'Stephen Gardiner', 'Katherine Cromwell', 'Thomas Boleyn', 'Henry VIII of England', 'George Boleyn', 'Jane Boleyn', 'Richard Riche', 'Mary I of England']",ebook,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Mystery', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', '21st Century']",,9781443422826,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357248720l/16117978.jpg,4.31,[],94.0,1.0,,16117978-wolf-hall-bring-up-the-bodies,,,,,96.0,4521.0,965,,HarperCollins Publishers,"['2313', '1549', '471', '112', '76']",,,[],,

It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm - a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not - charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South.

The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale.

Our choices and how we handle them shape the people we become.”In the aftermath of her 2008 presidential run, she expected to return to representing New York in the United States Senate. To her surprise, her former rival for the Democratic Party nomination, newly elected President Barack Obama, asked her to serve in his administration as Secretary of State. This memoir is the story of the four extraordinary and historic years that followed, and the hard choices that she and her colleagues confronted.Secretary Clinton and President Obama had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East. Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm’s way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden.By the end of her tenure, Secretary Clinton had visited 112 countries, traveled nearly one million miles, and gained a truly global perspective on many of the major trends reshaping the landscape of the twenty-first century, from economic inequality to climate change to revolutions in energy, communications, and health. Drawing on conversations with numerous leaders and experts, Secretary Clinton offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth, and LGBT people. An astute eyewitness to decades of social change, she distinguishes the trendlines from the headlines and describes the progress occurring throughout the world, day after day.Secretary Clinton’s descriptions of diplomatic conversations at the highest levels offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use “smart power” to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world—one in which America remains the indispensable nation.",,,June 10th 2013,June 10th 2014,['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Womens']",,9781476751443,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402198745l/17727276.jpg,3.61,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2014)'],35.0,1.0,,17727276-hard-choices,,,,,85.0,13069.0,788,,Simon Schuster,"['3237', '4364', '3485', '1095', '888']",,,[],,
Hillary Rodham Clinton,What Happened,,English,,"“In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I’ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I’m letting my guard down.” —Hillary Rodham Clinton, from the introduction of What HappenedFor the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. Now free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. This is her most personal memoir yet. In these pages, she describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign and its aftermath—both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.",,,,September 12th 2017,['Hillary Rodham Clinton'],Kindle Edition,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Feminism', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Womens']",,B01MYE7QP0,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501171573l/34114362.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2017)'],351.0,4.0,,34114362-what-happened,,,,,91.0,53165.0,512,,Simon & Schuster,"['17257', '21237', '10002', '2556', '2113']",,,[],,

Himaksh Kashyap (Goodreads Author),Karma Destiny or Choice,,English,,"Karma - Destiny or Choice is a small effort to simplify and to explain one of the most important Law of Nature ""Karma"". I know most of us feel it boring but it might be due to lengthy or heavy content of books. This book is not a Literature Masterpiece but I have tried to convey message in the simplest language. It is not related to any religion but still related to every religion. It talks about the connection of Karma with GOD, Human Being, Relations, Anger, Helping, Soul etc. Karma plays a very crucial role at every stage of Life and Death. Sometimes we feel very helpless and sometimes we have options. If we see the fixed pattern of life then we may think that Karma is Destiny but when Life changes by our Choices then it makes us believe Karma as a choice. This book addresses and discusses the same. We will come across to a simple law of nature which is made or presented as complicated.

"Hiroshi Sugimoto (Photographs), Pia Muller-Tamm",Hiroshi Sugimoto,,English,,"Genius of the large-format camera, the long exposure and the silverprint, New York-based photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto has made pictures that seem to contain whole aeons of time within themselves, and suggest an infinite palette of tonal wealth in blacks, grays and whites. Many of these images have now become a part of art culture's popular image bank (as U2's use of Sugimoto's ""Boden Sea"" for the cover of their 2009 album, No Line on the Horizon, demonstrated), while simultaneously evoking photography's earliest days: ""I probably call myself a postmodern-experienced pre-postmodern modernist,"" he once joked to an interviewer. This absolutely exquisite retrospective is an expanded edition of Hatje Cantz's 2005 volume. It is the first to feature works from all of Sugimoto's series to date: his celebrated portraits of wax figures, his incredible seascapes that seem to suggest a person's first conscious view of the ocean, the extremely long exposures of theaters which elevate the white, luminescent cinema screen and transform it into a magical image of an altar and the fascinating dioramas of scientific display cases, which invite us to travel far into the past.

But his nights have come to revolve around his mother’s increasingly disturbing bedside stories full of old family bitterness. And then one day Suleiman sees his father across the square of a busy marketplace, his face wrapped in a pair of dark sunglasses. Wasn’t he supposed to be away on business yet again? Why is he going into that strange building with the green shutters? Why did he lie? Suleiman is soon caught up in a world he cannot hope to understand—where the sound of the telephone ringing becomes a portent of grave danger; where his mother frantically burns his father’s cherished books; where a stranger full of sinister questions sits outside in a parked car all day; where his best friend’s father can disappear overnight, next to be seen publicly interrogated on state television.

"Ho Che Anderson, Gary Groth (Editor), Stanley Crouch (Introduction)","King, The Complete Edition: A Comics Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr.",,English,,"This groundbreaking body of comics journalism collects for first time Anderson's entire biography of the renowned civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Over a decade in the making, the saga has been praised for its vivid recreation of one of the most tumultuous periods in U.S. history and for its accuracy in depicting the personal and public lives of King, from his birth to his assassination. King probes the life story of one of America's greatest public figures with an unflinchingly critical eye, casting King as an ambitious, dichotomous figure deserving of his place in history but not above moral sacrifice to get there. Anderson's expressionistic visual style is wrought with dramatic energy; panels evoke a painterly attention to detail but juxtapose with one another in such a way as to propel King's story with cinematic momentum. Anderson's successful use of the graphic novel to tell a major work of nonfiction has drawn favorable comparisons to Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale, Joe Sacco's Palestine, and Osamu Tezuka's Adolph.Ho Che Anderson's biography traces King's life from his childhood in Atlanta and his education at Booker T. Washington High School, Morehouse College, and the Crozer Theological Seminary and his centrality to the civil rights movement: his first public involvement in civil rights when, in 1955, as President of the Montgomery Improvement Association, he organized the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott; his founding of the Southern Christian leadership Conference in 1957; his help in organizing the 1966 March on Washington and his ""I Have a Dream"" speech there; his Nobel price in 1964; his voter-registration campaign that ended in the Selma-to-Montgomery Freedom March; and the tragic moment on April 4, 1968 when he was shot dead on the balcony of the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. King not only recreates the major events in King's public life, but chronicles the daily, rough-and-tumble, behind-the-scenes political maneuverings and strategic compromises that were required to mobilize millions of people toward a common goal. His internal debates with Ralph Abernathy and Jesse Jackson and his hardball negotiations with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson are dramatized. Anderson's achievement is not merely a political biography filled with names and dates, but a fully rounded portrait of fallible human engaged in a superhuman effort his fears, his doubts, his relationship with his wife Coretta King, and his children are compassionately and truthfully rendered.Anderson's visual approach includes the use of photographs, realistic portraiture, and expressionistic imagery alternating between stark black and white chiaroscuro and painterly full color. The dialogue is unflinchingly naturalistic and accurately reflects the moral urgency and labyrinthine political and practical complexities that King was navigating, from his deeply felt, personal commitment to a public cause to the wider political eruptions the country was experiencing. This is a respectful, unsparing, truthful biography of a man and his times that captures the moral and political gravitas of the cause as well as its human dimension.

The Greeks, enraged by this audacity and devastated by the loss of the most beautiful woman in the world, set sail to Troy and began the long siege of the city. The Iliad narrates the events ten years into the war, describing the anger of Achilles, which results in the death of Patroclus and Achilles's mourning of him and avenging of his murder. It has had a far-reaching impact on Western literature and culture, inspiring writers, artists and classical composers across the ages.

Homer Hickam (Goodreads Author),Rocket Boys,,English,,"""Until I began to build and launch rockets, I didn't know my home town was at war with itself over its children, and that my parents were locked in a kind of bloodless combat over how my brother and I would live our lives. I didn't know that if a girl broke your heart, another girl, virtuous at least in spirit, could mend it on the same night. And I didn't know that the enthalpy decrease in a converging passage could be transformed into jet kinetic energy if a divergent passage was added. The other boys discovered their own truths when we built our rockets, but those were mine.""So begins Homer ""Sonny"" Hickam Jr.'s extraordinary memoir of life in Coalwood, West Virginia - a hard-scrabble little mining company town where the only things that mattered were coal mining and high school football and where the future was regarded with more fear than hope. Looking back after a distinguished NASA career, Hickam shares the story of his youth, taking readers into the life of the little mining town of Coalwood and the boys who would come to embody its dreams. In 1957 a young man watched the Soviet satellite Sputnik shoot across the Appalachian sky and soon found his future in the stars. 'Sonny' and a handful of his friends, Roy Lee Cook, Sherman O'Dell and Quentin Wilson were inspired to start designing and launching the home-made rockets that would change their lives forever.Step by step, with the help (and occasional hindrance) of a collection of unforgettable characters, the boys learn not only how to turn scrap into sophisticated rockets that fly miles into the sky, but how to sustain their dreams as they dared to imagine a life beyond its borders in a town that the postwar boom was passing by.A powerful story of growing up and of getting out, of a mother's love and a father's fears, Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys proves, like Angela's Ashes and Russell Baker's Growing Up before it, that the right storyteller and the right story can touch readers' hearts and enchant their souls.A uniquely endearing book with universal themes of class, family, coming of age, and the thrill of discovery, Homer Hickam's Rocket Boys is evocative, vivid storytelling at its most magical.In 1999, Rocket Boys was made into a Hollywood movie named October Sky starring Chris Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal and Laura Dern. October Sky is an anagram of Rocket Boys. It is also used in a period radio broadcast describing Sputnik 1 as it crossed the 'October sky'. Homer Hickam stated that ""Universal Studios marketing people got involved and they just had to change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled Rocket Boys"" so Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience. The book was later re-released with the name October Sky in order to capitalize on interest in the movie.",Coalwood #1,,10/28/98,January 11th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Science', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Space', 'School', 'Autobiography', 'Historical']",,9780385333214,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320533768l/96642.jpg,4.18,"['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography/Autobiography (1998)', 'Weatherford Award (1998)', 'Alabama Author Award for Nonfiction (2001)']",297.0,4.0,,96642.Rocket_Boys,,,,,95.0,17724.0,384,,Delta,"['7641', '6797', '2440', '570', '276']",,,['West Virginia (United States)'],,

The works attributed to Homer include the two oldest and greatest European epic poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad.

"Hong Ying, Martha Avery (Translation)",Summer of Betrayal,,English,,"At dawn on the June morning in 1989 following the brutal repression of student demonstrations in Beijing, a young poet flees the bullets, tanks, and soldiers, trying desperately to get back to the flat she shares with her lover. When she discovers him in bed with his estranged wife, she must strike out again - and alone - into the maelstrom of terror and risk that Beijing has become. In the ensuing months, as she is all but overwhelmed by painful memories of the past and by the turmoil of the present, she goes through a kind of sea change: sexual freedom and erotic liberation seem to be the only freedoms left to her, but these, too, may lead to betrayal, and she must find her bearings on her own. This remarkable first novel by a striking young Chinese author is a lyrical, outspoken account of a major turning point in Chinese history, and a cri de coeur from the generation that instigated the bold initiatives of 1989 and suffered most from the cruelties that followed. Summer of Betrayal was published in Taiwan in 1992; though banned in China, it circulated widely there.

For that matter, being magically bound to a mage-in-training hadn’t ever crossed his mind.  Being the first human familiar ever summoned in Corcoran? Not on his to-do list.  Rena certainly needs all of the help that she can get, as her magic is very different, inhibiting her of the normal shields and protections. Everyone says her summoning a human familiar is a mistake, that she needs to break the bond and send Bannen back.  But Bannen doesn’t like this idea, not one iota. Renata Rocci has the magic of a Grim Reaper, the heart of a lion, and a body too frail to keep up with either. She can face assassins; meddlesome mages; politicians; and legendary, nightmarish monsters without flinching. Without losing and that’s sexy as sin.  This is definitely not the adventure he signed up for.  It’s far, far better.

The break-in is daring enough, but their method shreds the magical wards and protections on the building like confetti paper. To say the police are ‘alarmed’ by this is the understatement of the century.  As a Magical Examiner, Henri Davenforth is of course immediately called in. Quite to his astonishment, Captain Gregson has him work the case like a detective. Even more astounding, he assigns Henri a partner.  The Shinigami Detective.  The woman is famous for killing the most destructive rogue witch of the century, and no one is quite certain where she’s from. Every officer in the precinct is either in awe of her or a little frightened by her. Henri is just baffled. What is he supposed to do with a partner?  Hopefully killing one witch makes Jamie Edwards enough of an expert on magic to be helpful, as the thieves aren’t content to just break into one building. They in fact seem to have an agenda, as with each theft, they take magical objects. It’s all mounting to a dangerously powerful magical construct capable of toppling the wards on any building.  And no one has any idea what the thieves’ true target is.

Hooman Majd,The Ayatollah Begs to Differ: The Paradox of Modern Iran,,English,,"A revealing look at Iran by an American journalist with an insider’s access behind Persian wallsThe grandson of an eminent ayatollah and the son of an Iranian diplomat, now an American citizen, Hooman Majd is, in a way, both 100 percent Iranian and 100 percent American, combining an insider’s knowledge of how Iran works with a remarkable ability to explain its history and its quirks to Western readers. In The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, he paints a portrait of a country that is fiercely proud of its Persian heritage, mystified by its outsider status, and scornful of the idea that the United States can dictate how it should interact with the community of nations.With wit, style, and an unusual ability to get past the typical sound bite on Iran, Majd reveals the paradoxes inherent in the Iranian character which have baffled Americans for more than thirty years. Meeting with sartorially challenged government officials in the presidential palace; smoking opium with an addicted cleric, his family, and friends; drinking fine whiskey at parties in fashionable North Tehran; and gingerly self-flagellating in a celebration of Ashura, Majd takes readers on a rare tour of Iran and shares insights shaped by his complex heritage. He considers Iran as a Muslim country, as a Shiite country, and, perhaps above all, as a Persian one. Majd shows that as Shiites marked by an inferiority complex, and Persians marked by a superiority complex, Iranians are fiercely devoted to protecting their rights, a factor that has contributed to their intransigence over their nuclear programs. He points to the importance of the Persian view of privacy, arguing that the stability of the current regime owes much to the freedom Iranians have to behave as they wish behind “Persian walls.” And with wry affection, Majd describes the Persian concept of ta’arouf, an exaggerated form of polite self-deprecation that may explain some of Iranian President Ahmadinejad’s more bizarre public moments. With unforgettable portraits of Iranians, from government figures to women cab drivers to reform-minded Ayatollahs, Majd brings to life a country that is deeply religious yet highly cosmopolitan, authoritarian yet with democratic and reformist traditions—an Iran that is a more nuanced nemesis to the United States than it is typically portrayed to be.",,,,September 23rd 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Iran', 'History', 'Politics', 'Religion', 'Islam', 'Travel', 'Cultural', 'Asia', 'Biography']",,9780385523349,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320445755l/3488337.jpg,3.76,[],95.0,1.0,,3488337-the-ayatollah-begs-to-differ,,,,,93.0,2042.0,272,,Doubleday,"['464', '827', '601', '103', '47']",,,[],,

In the days of Duke Aubrey, some centuries earlier, fairy things had been looked upon with reverence, and fairy fruit was brought down the Dapple and enjoyed by the people of Dorimare. But after Duke Aubrey had been expelled from Dorimare by the burghers, the eating of fairy fruit came to be regarded as a crime, and anything related to Fairyland was unspeakable. Now, when his son Ranulph is believed to have eaten fairy fruit, Nathaniel Chanticleer, the mayor of Lud-in-the-Mist, finds himself looking into old mysteries in order to save his son and the people of his city.",,,10/29/26,March 22nd 2005,"['Nathaniel Chanticleer', 'Enydmion Leer', 'Ranulph Chanticleer']",Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fairy Tales', 'Novels', 'High Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fairies', 'Fae']",,9781593600419,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387028171l/73574.jpg,3.86,['Prix Elbakin.net for Meilleur roman fantasy traduit (2016)'],185.0,2.0,,73574.Lud_in_the_Mist,,,,,92.0,5265.0,239,,Cold Spring Press,"['1534', '2002', '1293', '325', '111']",,,[],,

This volume, with its erudite introduction by Mario Praz, presents three of the most celebrated Gothic novels: The Castle of Otranto, published pseudonymously in 1765, is one of the first of the genre and the most truly Gothic of the three. Vathek (1786), an oriental tale by an eccentric millionaire, exotically combines Gothic romanticism with the vivacity of The Arabian Nights and is a narrative tour de force. The story of Frankenstein (1818) and the monster he created is as spine-chilling today as it ever was; as in all Gothic novels, horror is the keynote.

Crammed with catastrophe, terror, and ghostly interventions, the novel was an immediate success, and influenced numerous followers. These include William Beckford's Vathek (1786), which alternates grotesque comedy with scenes of exotic magnificence in the story of the ruthless Caliph Vathek's journey to damnation. The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, is a violent tale of ambition, murder, and incest, set in the sinister monastery of the Capuchins in Madrid. Frankenstein (1818, 1831) is Mary Shelley's disturbing and perennially popular tale of young student who learns the secret of giving life to a creature made from human relics, with horrific consequences.

"Horus Gilgamesh (Goodreads Author), Agnes Tickheathen (Illustrator)",Awkward Moments (not found in your average) Children's Bible - Vol. 1,,English,,"NOT FOR KIDS (or iPad or Nook)! What began as a private online joke among interfaith friends quickly skyrocketed to meet the demands of the thousands of fans and critics of the controversial work. Within hours, the book became the #1 Bestseller in Amazon.com's Humor & Religion category! Combining actual Bible verses with more than 30 whimsical original illustrations, Awkward Moments uses humor to encourage people from all walks of life to think, perhaps for the first time, about how the Bible continues to shape our culture.  BEWARE - NOT FOR KIDS! This is definitely not your average children's Bible! If you thought the bestseller ""Go The F**k To Sleep"" was inappropriate for story-time with kids, you haven't seen anything yet! Leave it to the Bible! Foreskins Fetishes? Unicorn Murders? Boiled Babies? Messiah, MIA? Selling Daughters? Cannibalism Club? Genetic Breakthroughs? Demonic Bacon? Gagged Women? Jihad Jesus? You bet! And much more!  From the opening foreword by acclaimed author David G. McAffee, to the challenging commentaries and interactive games at the end, Awkward Moments Children's Bible is much more than an irreverent book for your coffee table! Readers of all faiths will find themselves laughing out loud while being encouraged to think about the Bible in a new way.  Let’s be honest - there are some things in the Good Book that are just... awkward! There are verses we'd like to forget or that have been changed throughout the centuries. There are many verses you’ve never heard before in church, let alone seen in your average children’s Bible! Not to mention the verses that have been added over the centuries!  Most people were raised in the faith chosen by their family. Young children learn a few Bible stories taken out of context and accept them without question. (On what basis could they possibly question their parents or church leaders?) After decades of repetition and tradition, it's understandable that we might put our beliefs on auto-pilot and just nod as a pastor repeats the verses and ideas that are already familiar and comfortable to us. It's no wonder that recent studies show an incredible lack of Biblical knowledge among Christians - 55% unable to even name the four Gospels of the New Testament - the very foundation of Christianity!  The Goal? Awkward Moments encourages readers to really understand what is in their Bibles and think for themselves about the context of Biblical teaching. The 32 color illustrations and included commentaries will likely challenge some readers to reflect on how religion continues to shape the lives and culture of future generations. If readers happen to laugh out loud and enjoy the interactive puzzles and games in the mean time - it’s just an added bonus!

"Howard Dully, Charles Fleming",My Lobotomy: A Memoir,,English,,"At twelve, Howard Dully was guilty of the same crimes as other boys his age: he was moody and messy, rambunctious with his brothers, contrary just to prove a point, and perpetually at odds with his parents. Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital—or ice pick—lobotomy.Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasn’t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the “normal” life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?“October 8, 1960. I gather that Mrs. Dully is perpetually talking, admonishing, correcting, and getting worked up into a spasm, whereas her husband is impatient, explosive, rather brutal, won’t let the boy speak for himself, and calls him numbskull, dimwit, and other uncomplimentary names.”There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor’s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn’t intervened on his son’s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers. “December 3, 1960. Mr. and Mrs. Dully have apparently decided to have Howard operated on. I suggested [they] not tell Howard anything about it.”Through his research, Howard met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of Freeman’s sons about his father’s controversial life’s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity. And, in the archive where the doctor’s files are stored, he finally came face to face with the truth.Revealing what happened to a child no one—not his father, not the medical community, not the state—was willing to protect, My Lobotomy exposes a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately, this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man. Without reticence, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.",,,11/06/07,September 4th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Psychology', 'Biography', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography Memoir', 'Science', 'Autobiography']",,9780307381262,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449273l/503248.jpg,3.73,[],86.0,1.0,,503248.My_Lobotomy,,,,,91.0,11188.0,288,,Crown,"['2588', '4183', '3381', '870', '166']",,,[],,
Howard E. Covington,Lady on the Hill,How Biltmore Estate Became an American Icon,,Travel,"Lady on the Hill tells the inspiring story of the thirty-five-year effort to restore this fading beauty to her former glory--all without a penny of government funding or outside foundation grants. Central to this true-life tale of rebirth against the odds is George Vanderbilt's grandson William A. V. Cecil, a well-mannered, highly educated man who, when caught up in an idea, becomes a whirling dervish, generating enough energy and enthusiasm to motivate everyone around him. And, according to author Howard Covington Jr., Cecil gets a week's worth of ideas before he's done with his Monday morning shave. In the late 1950s, attorneys, financial managers, and tax accountants were united in advising Cecil and his brother, George, to sell off the estate's 12,000 acres in order to create a suburban subdivision. Cecil quietly ignored this advice and came up with a better idea: over the next four decades, he would turn this down-at-the-heels mansion that was a drain on the family business into the most successful, privately preserved historic site in the United States, perhaps even the world. Cecil succeeded beyond even his wildest dreams. Not only did he raise the money needed to begin and continue a painstaking, decades-long restoration of the house itself, but he also achieved a goal that even his grandfather had found elusive. He made Biltmore Estate a self-sustaining, working enterprise that included a vibrant tourist destination, a working winery and vineyard, and a farming operation; employed hundreds of people; and attracted hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy every year. Lady on the Hill tells a lively tale of eccentric, upper-crust characters, seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and one man's determination, innovation, loyalty, and stubborn persistence to succeed against the odds. It also provides a brilliant, if unorthodox, model for anyone involved with the preservation and restoration of a historic home.",,,,2006.0,,,,0471758183,9780471758181,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFp5AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.89,,,,,,,,,,,,331.0,,,,371.0,,,,

"Howard E. Wasdin, Stephen Templin (Goodreads Author)",SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper,,English,,"
  The New York Times best selling book that takes you inside SEAL Team Six – the covert squad that killed Osama Bin Laden.
SEAL Team Six is a secret unit tasked with counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and counterinsurgency. In this dramatic, behind-the-scenes chronicle, Howard Wasdin takes readers deep inside the world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers, beginning with the grueling selection process of Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)—the toughest and longest military training in the world.After graduating, Wasdin faced new challenges. First there was combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. Then the Green Course: the selection process to join the legendary SEAL Team Six, with a curriculum that included practiced land warfare to unarmed combat. More than learning how to pick a lock, they learned how to blow the door off its hinges. Finally as a member of SEAL Team Six he graduated from the most storied and challenging sniper program in the country: The Marine’s Scout Sniper School. Eventually, of the 18 snipers in SEAL Team Six, Wasdin became the best—which meant one of the best snipers on the planet.Less than half a year after sniper school, he was fighting for his life. The mission: capture or kill Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. From rooftops, helicopters and alleys, Wasdin hunted Aidid and killed his men whenever possible. But everything went quickly to hell when his small band of soldiers found themselves fighting for their lives, cut off from help, and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded. Howard Wasdin had both of his legs nearly blown off while engaging the enemy. His dramatic combat tales combined with inside details of becoming one of the world’s deadliest snipers make this one of the most explosive military memoirs in years. ",,,05/05/11,May 10th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Military Fiction', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'War', 'Memoir', 'Military History', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780312699451,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442949773l/9739365._SX318_.jpg,4.04,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2011)'],80.0,1.0,,9739365-seal-team-six,,,,,95.0,14786.0,331,,St. Martin's Press,"['5441', '5546', '2990', '629', '180']",,,[],,

Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor's grand, central London apartment. It's a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you had less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends' losses. And it's that very evening, at exactly 11:30pm, as Treslove hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country as he walks home, that he is attacked. After this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly and ineluctably change.",,,11/06/10,August 2nd 2010,"['Julian Treslove', 'Sam Finkler', 'Libor Sevcik', 'Hephzibah Weizenbaum']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Unfinished', 'Humor', 'Book Club']",,9781408808870,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1319018978l/8664368.jpg,2.79,"['Booker Prize (2010)', 'Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Nominee (2011)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2012)']",79.0,2.0,,8664368-the-finkler-question,,,,,60.0,14077.0,307,,Bloomsbury,"['970', '2891', '4587', '3479', '2150']",,,[],,
Howard Jacobson,"Whatever It Is, I Don’t Like It",,English,,"It takes a particular kind of man to want an embroidered polo player astride his left nipple. Occasionally, when I am tired and emotional, or consumed with self-dislike, I try to imagine myself as someone else, a wearer of Yarmouth shirts and fleecy sweats, of windbreakers and rugged Tyler shorts, of baseball caps with polo players where the section of the brain that concerns itself with aesthetics is supposed to be.

Howard L. Anderson (Goodreads Author),Albert of Adelaide,,English,,"At once an old-fashioned-buddy-novel-shoot-'em-up and a work of deliciously imagined fantasy, Howard L. Anderson's dazzling debut presents the haunting story of a world where something has gone horribly awry . . . Having escaped from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, an orphaned platypus named Albert embarks on a journey through the outback in search of ""Old Australia,"" a rumored land of liberty, promise, and peace. What he will find there, however, away from the safe confinement of his enclosure for the first time since his earliest memories, proves to be a good deal more than he anticipated. Alone in the outback, with an empty soft drink bottle as his sole possession, Albert stumbles upon pyromaniacal wombat Jack, and together they spend a night drinking and gambling in Ponsby Station, a rough-and-tumble mining town. Accused of burning down the local mercantile, the duo flees into menacing dingo territory and quickly go their separate ways-Albert to pursue his destiny in the wastelands, Jack to reconcile his past. Encountering a motley assortment of characters along the way-a pair of invariably drunk bandicoots, a militia of kangaroos, hordes of the mercurial dingoes, and a former prize-fighting Tasmanian devil-our unlikely hero will discover a strength and skill for survival he never suspected he possessed. Told with equal parts wit and compassion, Albert of Adelaide shows how it is often the unexpected route, and the most improbable companions, that lead us on the path to who we really are.

Howard Pyle,The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood,,English,,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood of Great Renown in Nottinghamshire is an 1883 novel by the American illustrator and writer Howard Pyle. Consisting of a series of episodes in the story of the English outlaw Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, the novel compiles traditional material into a coherent narrative in a colorful, invented ""old English"" idiom that preserves some flavor of the ballads, and adapts it for children. The novel is notable for taking the subject of Robin Hood, which had been increasingly popular through the 19th century, in a new direction that influenced later writers, artists, and filmmakers through the next century.[1]Pyle had been submitting illustrated poems and fairy tales to New York publications since 1876, and had met with success. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood was the first novel he attempted. He took his material from Middle Age ballads and wove them into a cohesive story, altering them for coherence and the tastes of his child audience. For example, he included ""Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar"" in the narrative order to reintroduce Friar Tuck. He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw Allan a Dale (Pyle's spelling of the original Alan-a-Dale) to his sweetheart Ellen. In the original ""A Gest of Robyn Hode"", the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger. Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of David of Doncaster, one of Robin's band in the story ""Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow."" In his novelistic treatment of the tales, Pyle thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad, such as David of Doncaster or Arthur a Bland.  Pyle's book continued the 19th-century trend of portraying Robin Hood as a heroic outlaw who robs the rich to feed the poor; this portrayal contrasts with the Robin Hood of the ballads, where the protagonist is an out-and-out crook, whose crimes are motivated by personal gain rather than politics or a desire to help others.[1] For instance, he modified the ballad ""Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham"", changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against a band of armed robbers. Pyle has Robin kill only one man, who shoots at him first. Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as ""Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford"", so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor.  Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy, but he renamed the queen-consort in the story ""Robin Hood and Queen Katherine"" as Eleanor (of Aquitaine). This made her compatible historically with King Richard the Lion-Hearted, with whom Robin eventually makes peace.  The novel was first published by Scribner's in 1883, and met with immediate success,[1] ushering in a new era of Robin Hood stories. It helped solidify the image of a heroic Robin Hood, which had begun in earlier works such as Walter Scott's 1819 novel Ivanhoe. In Pyle's wake, Robin Hood has become a staunch philanthropist protecting innocents against increasingly aggressive villains.[1] Along with the publication of the Child Ballads by Francis James Child, which included most of the surviving Robin Hood ballads, Pyle's novel helped increase the popularity of the Robin Hood legend in the United States. The Merry Adventures also had an effect on subsequent children's literature. It helped move the Robin Hood legend out of the realm of penny dreadfuls and into the realm of respected children's books.[2] After Pyle, Robin Hood became an increasingly popular subject for children's books: Louis Rhead's Bold Robin Hood and His Outlaw Band (1912) and Paul Creswick's Robin Hood (1917), illustrated by Pyle's pupil N.

Howard Zinn,A Power Governments Cannot Suppress,,English,,"A Power Governments Cannot Suppress is a major new collection of essays on American history, class, immigration, justice, and ordinary citizens who have made a difference. Zinn addresses America's current political/ethical crisis using lessons learned from our nation’s history. Zinn brings a profoundly human, yet uniquely American perspective to each subject he writes about, whether it’s the abolition of war, terrorism, the Founding Fathers, the Holocaust, defending the rights of immigrants, or personal liberties. Written in an accessible, personal tone, Zinn approaches the telling of U.S. history from an active, engaged point of view. ""America's future is linked to how we understand our past,” writes Zinn; ""For this reason, writing about history, for me, is never a neutral act.""Zinn frames the book with an opening essay titled ""If History is to be Creative,"" a reflection on the role and responsibility of the historian. ""To think that history-writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past,"" writes Zinn, ""is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat."" ""If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, and occasionally win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past’s fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare.""Buzzing with stories and ideas, Zinn draws upon fascinating, little-known historical anecdotes spanning from the Declaration of Independence to the USA PATRIOT Act to comment on the most controversial issues facing us today: government dishonesty, how to respond to terrorism, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the loss of our liberties, immigration, and the responsibility of the citizen to confront power for the common good.Considered a ""modern-day Thoreau"" by Jonathon Kozol, Zinn's inspired writings address the reader as an active participant in history making. ""We live in a beautiful country,” writes Zinn, in the book’s opening chapter. “But people who have no respect for human life, freedom, or justice have taken it over. It is now up to all of us to take it back.""Featuring essays penned over an eight-year period, A Power Governments Cannot Suppress is Howard Zinn’s first writerly work in several years, an invaluable post-9/11-era addition to the themes that run through his bestselling classic, A People’s History Of the United States.Howard Zinn is a veteran of World War II and author of many books and plays, including the million-selling classic, A People’s History of the United States. ""Thank you, Howard Zinn. Thank you for telling us what none of our leaders are willing to: The truth. And you tell it with such brilliance, such humanity.

"Howard Zinn, Paul M.

More than a successful book, A People’s History triggered a revolution in the way history is told, displacing the official versions with their emphasis on great men in high places to chronicle events as they were lived, from the bottom up.Now Howard Zinn, historian Paul Buhle, and cartoonist Mike Konopacki have collaborated to retell, in vibrant comics form, a most immediate and relevant chapter of A People’s History: the centuries-long story of America’s actions in the world. Narrated by Zinn, this version opens with the events of 9/11 and then jumps back to explore the cycles of U.S. expansionism from Wounded Knee to Iraq, stopping along the way at World War I, Central America, Vietnam, and the Iranian revolution. The book also follows the story of Zinn, the son of poor Jewish immigrants, from his childhood in the Brooklyn slums to his role as one of America’s leading historians.Shifting from world-shattering events to one family’s small revolutions, A People’s History of American Empire presents the classic ground-level history of America in a dazzling new form.",,,11/06/08,April 1st 2008,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Graphic Novels', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Comics', 'American History', 'War', 'Historical', 'American', 'Bande Dessinée']",,9780805087444,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312042463l/1782543.jpg,4.14,[],55.0,1.0,,1782543.A_People_s_History_of_American_Empire,,,,,94.0,2644.0,288,,Metropolitan Books,"['1147', '925', '414', '105', '53']",,,[],,

"Howie Mandel, Josh Young",Here's the Deal: Don't Touch Me,,English,,"A frank, funny, no-holds-barred memoir that reveals the Deal or No Deal host’s ongoing struggle with OCD and ADHD–and how it has shaped his life and career. Howie Mandel is one of the most recognizable names in entertainment–respected by his peers and beloved by audiences as the host of the enormously popular prime-time game show Deal or No Deal. With a career that spans three decades and many different show-business platforms–he’s a renowned stand-up comedian who continues to perform more than 150 sold-out shows a year, he created the award-winning TV show Bobby’s World, he’s starred in feature films and the hit TV series St. Elsewhere, and he’s also hosted his own daytime talk show–he’s one of the most versatile performers anywhere. But there are aspects of his personal and professional life he’s never talked about publicly–until now.Eleven years ago, Mandel first told the world about his “germophobia.” He’s recently started discussing his adult ADHD as well. Now, for the first time, he reveals the details of his struggle with these challenging disorders. He catalogs his numerous fears and neuroses and shares entertaining stories about how he has tried to integrate them into his act. “If I’m making myself laugh,” he writes, “then I’m distracted from all the other things going on in my head that are, at times, torturous.” And he speaks frankly and honestly about the ways his condition has affected his personal life–as a son, husband, and father of three.Fans who’ve been dying to know “the deal” behind Mandel’s remarkable rise through the show-business ranks will be rewarded with many never-before-told anecdotes, each one generously leavened with Mandel’s trademark humor. There are tales from every phase of his colorful career–from his early days as a teenage carpet salesman and aspiring stand-up comic to his stint opening for Diana Ross, his six years on St. Elsewhere, and beyond. As heartfelt as it is hilarious, Here’s the Deal: Don’t Touch Me is the story of one man’s effort to draw comic inspiration out of his darkest, most vulnerable places. It’s sure to please Howie Mandel’s legion of fans–and provide hope to the millions who strive to succeed in spite of OCD and ADHD.",,,01/01/09,November 24th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Audiobook', 'Comedy', 'Biography Memoir', 'Canada', 'Mental Health']",,9780553807868,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320535828l/6609535.jpg,3.75,[],97.0,1.0,,6609535-here-s-the-deal,,,,,90.0,3047.0,220,,Bantam,"['801', '1060', '894', '216', '76']",,,[],,

"Hubert SelJr., Gilbert Sorrentino (Editor)",Last Exit to Brooklyn,,English,,"Few novels have caused as much debate as Hubert Selby Jr.'s notorious masterpiece, Last Exit to Brooklyn, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting.Described by various reviewers as hellish and obscene, Last Exit to Brooklyn tells the stories of New Yorkers who at every turn confront the worst excesses in human nature. Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. Last Exit to Brooklyn was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK.

Hugh Ambrose,The Pacific,,English,,"Penguin delivers you to the front lines of The Pacific Theater with the real-life stories behind the HBO miniseries.Between America's retreat from China in late November 1941 and the moment General MacArthur's airplane touched down on the Japanese mainland in August of 1945, five men connected by happenstance fought the key battles of the war against Japan. From the debacle in Bataan, to the miracle at Midway and the relentless vortex of Guadalcanal, their solemn oaths to their country later led one to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot and the others to the coral strongholds of Peleliu, the black terraces of Iwo Jima and the killing fields of Okinawa, until at last the survivors enjoyed a triumphant, yet uneasy, return home.  In The Pacific, Hugh Ambrose focuses on the real-life stories of the five men who put their lives on the line for our country. To deepen the story revealed in the miniseries and go beyond it, the book dares to chart a great ocean of enmity known as The Pacific and the brave men who fought. Some considered war a profession, others enlisted as citizen soldiers. Each man served in a different part of the war, but their respective duties required every ounce of their courage and their strength to defeat an enemy who preferred suicide to surrender. The medals for valor which were pinned on three of them came at a shocking price-a price paid in full by all.",,,12/01/09,March 2nd 2010,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'World War II', 'Military History', 'Biography', 'Asia', 'Autobiography', 'Historical']",,9780451230232,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347284164l/7494887.jpg,4.13,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)'],98.0,1.0,,7494887-the-pacific,,,,,94.0,11760.0,489,,Nal Caliber,"['5106', '3962', '2026', '468', '198']",,,[],,

As such, he gathered hard, corroborated intelligence on Argentine intentions over the Falklands - which the British establishment then chose to ignore. The reasons behind this British decision, and its disastrous and inevitable consequences in the South Atlantic, are the main story of this book. There were three main players in the war, each of them trying to overcome their own cultural baggage. The Argentines were riddled with guilt: after years of fighting a morally repugnant campaign against its own people, the Argentine military saw a war for the Malvinas islands as a perfect opportunity to win back their self-respect. The hands of the Americans were also bloody from the likewise dirty wars they had sponsored and abetted in Central America.

"Hugh Davis Graham, Nancy Diamond",The Rise of American Research Universities: Elites and Challengers in the Postwar Era,,English,,"Before the Second World War, few universities in the United States had earned high respect among the international community of scholars and scientists. Since 1945, however, the distinctive attributes of American higher education—decentralized administration, pluralistic and research-minded faculties, and intense competition for government funding—have become world standard. Whether measured by Nobel and other prizes, international applications for student admissions and faculty appointments, or the results of academic surveys, America's top research universities are the best in the world.The Rise of American Research Universities provides a fresh historical interpretation of their ascendancy and a fresh, comprehensive estimate of their scholarly achievement. Hugh Davis Graham and Nancy Diamond question traditional methods of rating the reputation and performance of universities; they offer instead an empirical analysis of faculty productivity based on research grants received, published research, and peer approval of that work. Comparing the research achievements of faculty at more than 200 institutions, they differ with most studies of higher education in measuring performance in every academic field—from medicine to humanities—and in analyzing data on research activity in terms of institutional size.In this important and timely work, Graham and Diamond reassess the success of American universities as research institutions and the role of public funding in their developmentfrom the expansionist ""golden years"" of the 1950s and '60s, through the austerity measures of the 1970s and the entrepreneurial ethos of the 1980s, to the budget crises universities face in the 1990s.",,,,January 8th 1997,[],Hardcover,[],,9780801854255,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348135333l/1529902.jpg,3.5,[],91.0,1.0,,1529902.The_Rise_of_American_Research_Universities,,,,,,4.0,,,The Johns Hopkins University Press,[],,,[],,

Instead, I'll show you easy and confidence-inspiring ways with cuts of meat, types of fish and other ingredients you may not have tried before. And I'll offer you new approaches that I hope will breath new life to familiar staples, like rice, spuds, beans, and your daily bread.Above all, I intend to tempt you irresistibly towards a better life with food, with a whole raft of recipes that I think you will love. I hope some of them will become your absolute favourites, and the favourites of your dear friends and beloved family. I hope that the dishes you like best will infiltrate and influence your cooking, giving you increased confidence and fresh ideas.

Hugh Kenner,The Pound Era,,,Literary Criticism,"""It is notoriously difficult to recognize degrees of pre-eminence among one's near-contemporaries.

"Hugh Lofting, Michael Hague (Illustrations)",The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle,,English,,"The delightfully eccentric Doctor Dolittle, rendered immortal on screen by the gifted Rex Harrison, has remained a firm favorite with generations of children ever since he made his debut in an earlier novel, The Story of Doctor Dolittle.In his second outing titledThe Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, the maverick physician takes on a new assistant, Tommy Stubbins. The story is structured as a first person account given by Tommy, who is now a very old man. The boy who was the son of the village cobbler first meets Doctor Dolittle when he takes a hurt squirrel to the doctor for treatment. Tommy and the doctor quickly become friends, and the boy soon learns how to communicate with animals in their own languages. The remarkable talking parrot, Polynesia and other amazing creatures from the previous book also appear in this sequel. The mysterious disappearance of a friend of the doctor's called Luke the Hermit sets off a train of strange events. And Tommy finds himself accompanying the good doctor on an exciting, hazardous voyage to find Long Arrow, a native American and the son of Golden Arrow, who is reputed to be the greatest living naturalist in the world.The kind hearted, quirky, animal rights activist Doctor Dolittle dominates the plot. His enduring humanitarian approach to the world around him, his desire for peaceful coexistence among all and his concern for the environment make him a memorable and endearing character. This as much an adventure story as a strong appeal for compassion towards the innumerable species that share our planet with us. There are shipwrecks, South American and Mediterranean locations, underwater explorations where they discover a giant sea snail and wonderful descriptions of land and sea.Critics of Hugo Lofting's work point out that there are several passages which are now politically incorrect. However, readers would do well to remember that these books were written more than a hundred years ago, when attitudes to colonization and race were quite different.In the dozen or so books featuring Doctor Dolittle, the author Hugo Lofting ensures that a wide variety of themes, locations and ideas are explored. The books were originally illustrated by the author himself, as he was a talented artist and naturalist himself.

Hugh MacLeod,Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys to Creativity,,English,,"When Hugh MacLeod was a struggling young copywriter living in a YMCA, he started to doodle on the backs of business cards while sitting at a bar. Those cartoons eventually led to a popular blog-gapingvoid.com-and a reputation for pithy insight and humor, in both words and pictures.MacLeod has opinions on everything from marketing to the meaning of life, but one of his main subjects is creativity. How do new ideas emerge in a cynical, risk-averse world? Where does inspiration come from? What does it take to make a living as a creative person?Ignore Everybody expands on MacLeod's sharpest insights, wittiest cartoons, and most useful advice. For example:-Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more commercial will just make people like it less.-If your plan depends on you suddenly being ""discovered"" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. Nobody suddenly discovers anything. Things are made slowly and in pain.-Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. There's no point trying to do the same thing as 250,000 other young hopefuls, waiting for a miracle. All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.-The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours. The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will.After learning MacLeod's forty keys to creativity, you will be ready to unlock your own brilliance and unleash it on the world.",,,10/30/09,June 11th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Art', 'Self Help', 'Writing', 'Design', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Philosophy']",,9781591842590,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347753770l/6162567.jpg,4.0,[],99.0,1.0,,6162567-ignore-everybody,,,,,91.0,19788.0,159,,Portfolio,"['8173', '5998', '3742', '1234', '641']",,,[],,

Hunter S.

Thompson’s wildly popular ESPN.com columns. From the author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and father of “Gonzo” journalism comes Hey Rube. Insightful, incendiary, outrageously brilliant, such was the man who galvanized American journalism with his radical ideas and gonzo tactics. For over half a century, Hunter S. Thompson devastated his readers with his acerbic wit and uncanny grasp of politics and history. His reign as ""The Unabomber of contemporary letters"" (Time) is more legendary than ever with Hey Rube. Fear, greed, and action abound in this hilarious, thought-provoking compilation as Thompson doles out searing indictments and uproarious rants while providing commentary on politics, sex, and sports—at times all in the same column. With an enlightening foreword by ESPN executive editor John Walsh, critics' favorites, and never-before-published columns, Hey Rube follows Thompson through the beginning of the new century, revealing his queasiness over the 2000 election (""rigged and fixed from the start""); his take on professional sports (to improve Major League Baseball ""eliminate the pitcher""); and his myriad controversial opinions and brutally honest observations on issues plaguing America―including the Bush administration and the inequities within the American judicial system.

Hunter S. Thompson,Screwjack,A Short Story,,Fiction,"Hunter S. Thompson's legions of fans have waited a decade for this book. They will not be disappointed. His notorious Screwjack is as salacious, unsettling, and brutally lyrical as it has been rumored to be since the private printing in 1991 of three hundred fine collectors' copies and twenty-six leather-bound presentation copies. Only the first of the three pieces included here -- ""Mescalito,"" published in Thompson's 1990 collection Songs of the Doomed -- has been available to the public, making the trade edition of Screwjack a major publishing event. ""We live in a jungle of pending disasters,"" Thompson warns in ""Mescalito,"" a chronicle of his first mescaline experience and what it sparked in him while he was alone in an L.A. hotel room in February 1969 -- including a bout of paranoia that would have made most people just scream no, once and for all. But for Thompson, along with the downside came a burst of creativity too powerful to ignore. The result is a poetic, perceptive, and wildly funny stream-of-consciousness take on 1969 America as only Hunter S. Thompson could see it. Screwjack just gets weirder with its second offering, ""Death of a Poet."" As Thompson describes this trailer-park confrontation with the dark side of a deservingly doomed friend: ""Whoops, I thought. Welcome to the night train."" The heart of the collection lies in its final, title piece, an unnaturally poignant love story. What makes the romantic tale ""Screwjack"" so touching, for all its queerness, is the aching melancholy in its depiction of the modern man's burden: that ""we are doomed. Mama has gone off to Real Estate School ...and after that maybe even to Law School. We will never see her again."" Ostensibly written by Raoul Duke, ""Screwjack"" begins with an editor's note explaining of Thompson's alter ego that ""the first few lines contain no warning of the madness and fear and lust that came more and more to plague him and dominate his life...."" ""I am guilty, Lord,"" Thompson writes, ""but I am also a lover -- and I am one of your best people, as you know; and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy from time to time and even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarrassment to you...."" Nor has Hunter S. Thompson been to American literature. Quite the contrary: What the legendary Gonzo journalist proves with Screwjack is just how brilliant a prose stylist he really is, amid all the hilarity.

Hunter S. Thompson,Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie,,English,,"""Hunter S. Thompson is to drug-addled, stream-of-consciousness, psycho-political black humor what Forrest Gump is to idiot savants.""—The Philadelphia InquirerSince his 1972 trailblazing opus, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, Hunter S. Thompson has reported the election story in his truly inimitable, just-short-of-libel style. In Better than Sex, Thompson hits the dusty trail again—without leaving home—yet manages to deliver a mind-bending view of the 1992 presidential campaign—in all of its horror, sacrifice, lust, and dubious glory. Complete with faxes sent to and received by candidate Clinton's top aides, and 100 percent pure gonzo screeds on Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Oliver North, here is the most true-blue campaign tell-all ever penned by man or beast.""[Thompson] delivers yet another of his trademark cocktail mixes of unbelievable tales and dark observations about the sausage grind that is the U.S. presidential sweepstakes. Packed with egocentric anecdotes, musings and reprints of memos, faxes and scrawled handwritten notes...Memorable.""--Los Angeles Daily News""What endears Hunter Thompson to anyone who reads him is that he will say what others are afraid to....[He] is a master at the unlikely but invariably telling line that sums up a political figure....In a year when all politics is—to much of the public—a tendentious and pompous bore, it is time to read Hunter Thompson.""—Richmond Times-Dispatch""While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment. He made himself a part of every story, made no apologies for it and thus produced far more honest reporting than any crusading member of the Fourth Estate....Thompson isn't afraid to take the hard medicine, nor is he bashful about dishing it out....He is still king of beasts, and his apocalyptic prophecies seldom miss their target.""—Tulsa World""This is a very, very funny book.

Thompson’s life as a rebel—from a smart-mouthed Kentucky kid flaunting all authority to a convention-defying journalist who came to personify a wild fusion of fact, fiction, and mind-altering substances.Brilliant, provocative, outrageous, and brazen, Hunter S. Thompson's infamous rule breaking—in his journalism, in his life, and under the law—changed the shape of American letters, and the face of American icons. Call it the evolution of an outlaw.

Whether detailing his exploits as a foreign correspondent in Rio, his job as night manager of the notorious O’Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, his epic run for sheriff of Aspen on the Freak Power ticket, or the sensational legal maneuvering that led to his full acquittal in the famous 99 Days trial, Thompson is at the peak of his narrative powers in Kingdom of Fear.

Hunter S. Thompson,Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream,,English,,"First published in 1990, Songs of the Doomed is back in print -- by popular demand! In this third and most extraordinary volume of the Gonzo Papers, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson recalls high and hideous moments in his thirty years in the Passing Lane -- and no one is safe from his hilarious, remarkably astute social commentary.  With Thompson's trademark insight and passion about the state of American politics and culture, Songs of the Doomed charts the long, strange trip from Kennedy to Quayle in Thompson's freewheeling, inimitable style.

Her home on the border with China gave her some exposure to the world beyond the confines of the Hermit Kingdom and, as the famine of the 1990s struck, she began to wonder, question and to realise that she had been brainwashed her entire life. Given the repression, poverty and starvation she witnessed surely her country could not be, as she had been told “the best on the planet”?Aged seventeen, she decided to escape North Korea. She could not have imagined that it would be twelve years before she was reunited with her family.She could not return, since rumours of her escape were spreading, and she and her family could incur the punishments of the government authorities – involving imprisonment, torture, and possible public execution. Hyeonseo instead remained in China and rapidly learned Chinese in an effort to adapt and survive. Twelve years and two lifetimes later, she would return to the North Korean border in a daring mission to spirit her mother and brother to South Korea, on one of the most arduous, costly and dangerous journeys imaginable.This is the unique story not only of Hyeonseo’s escape from the darkness into the light, but also of her coming of age, education and the resolve she found to rebuild her life – not once, but twice – first in China, then in South Korea.

"Håkan Nesser, Christel Hildebrandt",Sein letzter Fall,,German,," Håkan Nessers Kriminalroman beginnt in der Vergangenheit und reicht bis in die Zeit zurück, als sein Kommissar Van Veeteren noch nicht pensioniert war: In einem leeren Swimmingpool wird eine Frau tot aufgefunden, und ihr Ehemann gerät schnell in Mordverdacht. Jaan G. Hennan, der mit seiner Frau vor wenigen Monaten aus Amerika eingewandert ist, kommt nach ihrem Tod einerseits in den Genuss einer Lebensversicherung; andererseits stellt sich heraus, dass Barbara Hennan kurz vor ihrem Tod den Detektiv Maarten Verlangen beauftragt hatte, ihren Mann zu beschatten.  Für Kommissar Van Veeteren ist der Verdächtige kein Unbekannter. Er kennt G. seit seiner Schulzeit und hat damals bittere Erfahrungen mit ihm gemacht. Nun ist der ehemals vorbestrafte G. als erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann heimgekehrt. Van Veeteren ist fest davon überzeugt, dass G der Mörder ist und setzt ihn in stundenlangen Verhören unter Druck. Doch trotz aller Indizien ist dem mutmaßlichen Mörder nichts nachzuweisen. Da er für die Tatzeit ein wasserdichtes Alibi hat, kommt er frei und verschwindet wieder im Ausland.  15 Jahre später hat Ex-Kommissar Van Veeteren immer noch schwer an diesem einzigen ungelösten Fall seiner Laufbahn zu beißen. Als eines Tages die Tochter des Detektivs Verlangen ihren Vater als vermisst meldet, ahnt Van Veeteren, dass der Detektiv damals offenbar mehr über Hennan in Erfahrung gebracht hatte, als er zu Protokoll gab. Damit erscheint der Fall G. in einem gänzlich neuen Licht ...  In Sein letzter Fall zeigt sich Håkan Nesser von seiner besten Seite. Zweifellos ist es dem schwedischen Autoren mit diesem Buch gelungen, innerhalb seiner Van-Veeteren-Serie einen subtilen erzählerischen Höhepunkt zu setzen. Gleichwohl wirkt die Verlagsmitteilung, das Buch sei Van Veeterens zehnter und letzter Fall, ein wenig irritierend. Soll dies wirklich das Ende sein?  Der Verlag stattet das Buch zu diesem vermeintlichen Schlusspunkt mit einem detaillierten Begleitheft zur Van-Veeteren-Reihe aus, was vor allem bei Nesser-Fans Anklang finden dürfte. Im Rückblick zeichnet Håkan Nessers Bücher aus, dass sie frei sind von der Melancholie, dem düsteren Existenzialismus und dem gesellschaftlichen Skeptizismus, die sich zum Teil wie Mehltau über die Kriminalromane skandinavischer Provenienz ausgebreitet haben. Nesser ist es auf phantasievolle und ironische Weise gelungen, eine Welt mit fiktiven, halbrealen Orten zu entwerfen. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser eigentümlichen, fast märchenhaften Erzählwelt lenkt Nesser unsere Aufmerksamkeit letzten Endes auf die einfache Tatsache, dass menschlichen Handlungen und Entscheidungen immer auch eine ironische Tragik inne wohnt. Das ist zeitlos und wirkt stellenweise geradezu poetisch. --Christian Koch",Inspector Van Veeteren #10,,11/05/03,June 6th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Crime', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Sweden', 'Thriller', 'Nordic Noir', 'Murder Mystery', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Detective']",,9783442734771,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1187877625l/1761943._SY475_.jpg,3.86,[],94.0,2.0,,1761943.Sein_letzter_Fall,,,,,94.0,876.0,544,,btb,"['215', '385', '225', '37', '14']",,,[],,

Across the globe, we sat riveted to television and computer screens as journalists flocked to the Atacama desert. While we saw what transpired above ground during the grueling and protracted rescue, the story of the miners’ experiences below the earth’s surface—and the lives that led them there—hasn’t been heard until now.     In Deep Down Dark, a master work by a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist, Héctor Tobar gains exclusive access to the miners and their stories. The result is a miraculous and emotionally textured account of the thirty-three men who came to think of the San José mine as a kind of coffin, as a “cave” inflicting constant and thundering aural torment, and as a church where they sought redemption through prayer while the world watched from above.

A Sombra passa então a controlar todas as atitudes e comportamentos da pessoa.

Desta forma não criamos a Sombra, estaremos livres para decidirmos o que queremos fazer e não seremos conduzidos cegamente pela vida a fora sem consciência dos nossos atos.

Hélène Berr,The Journal of Hélène Berr,,English,,"Not since The Diary of Anne Frank has there been such a book as this: The joyful but ultimately heartbreaking journal of a young Jewish woman in occupied Paris, now being published for the first time, 63 years after her death in a Nazi concentration camp.On April 7, 1942, Hélène Berr, a 21-year-old Jewish student of English literature at the Sorbonne, took up her pen and started to keep a journal, writing with verve and style about her everyday life in Paris — about her studies, her friends, her growing affection for the “boy with the grey eyes,” about the sun in the dewdrops, and about the effect of the growing restrictions imposed by France’s Nazi occupiers. Berr brought a keen literary sensibility to her writing, a talent that renders the story it relates all the more rich, all the more heartbreaking. The first day Berr has to wear the yellow star on her coat, she writes, “I held my head high and looked people so straight in the eye they turned away. But it’s hard.” More, many more, humiliations were to follow, which she records, now with a view to posterity. She wants the journal to go to her fiancé, who has enrolled with the Free French Forces, as she knows she may not live much longer. She was right. The final entry is dated February 15, 1944, and ends with the chilling words: “Horror! Horror! Horror!” Berr and her family were arrested three weeks later. She went — as was discovered later — on the death march from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, where she died of typhus in April 1945, within a month of Anne Frank and just days before the liberation of the camp.The journal did eventually reach her fiancé, and for over fifty years it was kept private. In 2002, it was donated to the Memorial of the Shoah in Paris. Before it was first published in France in January 2008, translation rights had already been sold for twelve languages.",,,10/29/08,November 11th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Holocaust', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'France', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Diary']",,9780771013133,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320534834l/4600787.jpg,4.07,[],194.0,2.0,,4600787-the-journal-of-h-l-ne-berr,,,,,95.0,1335.0,320,,McClelland & Stewart,"['515', '477', '278', '47', '18']",,,[],,
Hélène Greven-Borde,Margaret Atwood: The Handmaid's Tale,,French,,"
  Non-fiction book about Margaret Atwood. This is not the novel The Handmaid's Tale.
The Handmaid's Tale (1985), by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, revisits the Anglo-American utopian/dystopian tradition. Appealing to imaginative fiction and the novel of ideas, the construction of perfect - or nightmarish - worlds rouses the reader's socio-political awareness of the present and invites questions on the shape of the near furure. The Handmaid's Tale deconstructs the utopian narrative by breaking the chronological order of the female protagonist's experience into a time-shifting testimony, a quest for meaning and an exploration of self versus the other. The intricate play on word and symbol can be read against the historical background of seventeenth-century New England Puritanism, as well as the twentieth-century New Right and women's rights movements, while inviting reference to the postmodernist outlook. This volume includes a bibliography, a study of the book's context, as well as essays and commentaries; the approach has been adapted to the needs of Capes and Agregation students.",,First edition,,November 1st 1998,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Feminism', 'Science Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Literature']",,9782864603498,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331151535l/8712.jpg,4.33,[],99.0,1.0,,8712.Margaret_Atwood,,,,,96.0,3565.0,108,,Klincksieck,"['1938', '1071', '414', '78', '64']",,,[],,
