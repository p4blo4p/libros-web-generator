F. David Peat,The Blackwinged Night: Creativity In Nature And Mind,,English,,"What does the creation of matter in the universe have to do with humanity's creative spirit? What is the connection between, on the one hand, art, literature, and music, and, on the other hand, mathematical theorems and scientific theories? Taking an overarching scientific view of the universe and our place in it, scientist-philosopher F. David Peat explores the incredible similarities and connections between the Universe's ""creativity,"" which reveals itself in the laws of nature, and the creativity of human consciousness. He provides an unparalleled view of the origins of the universe and asks: What acts to transform matter into art? And how does creativity enter into the lives of each of us? Brilliant and wide-ranging, The Blackwinged Night explores the very essence of the creative spirit and the way it animates the physical world, giving us the power to experience beauty-whether gazing into the night sky or listening to Bach's B-minor Mass.",,,04/06/00,May 10th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics']",,9780738204918,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348267717l/813710.jpg,3.74,[],93.0,1.0,,813710.The_Blackwinged_Night,,,,,87.0,23.0,240,,Perseus Publishing,"['5', '11', '4', '2', '1']",,,[],,
F. David Peat,Blackfoot Physics: A Journey into the Native American Worldview,,English,,"One summer in the 1980s, theoretical physicist F. David Peat went to a Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony. Having spent all of his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and native elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. Blackfoot Physics is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages--the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity's understanding. Through Peat's insightful observations, he extends our understanding of ourselves, our understanding of the universe, and how the two intersect in a meaningful vision of human life in relation to a greater reality.",,,09/29/94,December 23rd 2005,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Religion', 'Metaphysics']",,9781578633715,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348044604l/110248.jpg,4.23,[],100.0,1.0,,110248.Blackfoot_Physics,,,,,94.0,137.0,352,,Weiser Books,"['66', '45', '18', '7', '1']",,,[],,
F. Paul Wilson (Goodreads Author),The Select,,English,,"Quinn Cleary has always wanted to be a doctor. Yet the only way she can afford it is to win acceptance to The Ingraham, an exclusive, privately funded medical school and reasearch center reputed to be the nation's finest. The few selected students chosen by The Ingraham receive a completely free medical education: tuition, room. board, and lab fees all paid by the school.Once accepted to the school of her dreams, Quinn dives into her studies and into a steady realationship with a classmate. At last, her life seems perfect.Or is it? Quinn begins to notice subtle changes in her classmates: the way they act, the way they think -- all seem to be falling eerily into line with the messanic verison of the school's director. She confides her concerns to her boyfriend, who laughs them off -- until he finds a suspicious electronic monitoring device in his room.Then he disappears....Alone on the deserted campus during midyear break, Quinn finally encounters the dark truth about The Ingraham -- the true purpose of the institute's seemingly humane medical research, the motives that have determined the school's policy, and the secret mission of the hospital's intimidating security force, a small private army that is drawing an ever tighter net around her with each passing minute.What she dicovers is immense and terrifying -- a conspiracy that exposes her to a danger more frightening than death -- a cynical plot that undermines everything she has ever believed about the healing arts.This is suspense fiction at its grandest: instantly and relentlessly compelling, and touching directly on an issue that heads the list of our national and personal priorites.",,,01/01/93,1994,[],Hardcover,"['Thriller', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Medical', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Action']",,9780006880462,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1392656674l/477272.jpg,3.91,[],47.0,1.0,,477272.The_Select,,,,,93.0,1560.0,333,,Morrow,"['472', '597', '388', '78', '25']",,,[],,

It would be political suicide. But President Thomas Winston has taken the boldest and most bizarre step in the War on Drugs that the United States has ever seen. Vowing to make narcotics legal and to tax and regulate them to the brink of extinction, he intends to take the billions of dollars generated from their sale out of the hands of the drug cartels and move the money into the government's coffers. The conservatives and the Bible Belt are outraged. They swear they'll fight to the death to defeat the President's proposal and see him impeached. The drug lords laugh - they're sure decriminalization will never happen. But then important and respected figures begin to speak out in the media, guardedly supporting President Winston's ideas.

  Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom.  But things have changed so there's nothing holding Jack in check any longer.  Other changes are occurring as well.  Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken's time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place.
   
  Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady.  Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality.  But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom's go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy.  
   
  Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby.  The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined.
   
  Now the stage is set for Jack's massive assault on Rasalom.  Jack knows he's got just one shot.  But it's not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn's child and minimize collateral damage.  So, he comes up with a foolproof plan.

F. Scott Fitzgerald,A Life in Letters,A New Collection Edited and Annotated by Matthew J. Bruccoli,,Biography & Autobiography,"A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary ""jazz age"" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.",,,,1995.0,,,,0684801531,9780684801537,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1oz-yAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.24,,,,,,,,,,,,528.0,,,,178.0,,,,

It is markedly different from The Great Gatsby: two chapters were completely rewritten for the published novel, and the rest of the book was heavily revised.

F.J. Lennon (Goodreads Author),Soul Trapper,,English,,"Kane Pryce knows that ghosts are real . . . and that sometimes they have unfinished business. Shortly after death, a soul will see a door of light leading to the afterlife. But sometimes, when there’s something or someone still pulling at them, souls turn their back to this door. Instead, they haunt the living . . . Hollywood native Kane Pryce isn’t your average twenty-something dabbling musician. Yes, he’s an occasional substance abuser with a distrustful nature and self-destructive streak. And yes, most people might take him for a down-on-his-luck slacker. But to those in a very small circle, he’s also known as a ghost-hunting legend. Delving deep into the supernatural isn’t a lifestyle that Kane chose for himself, however; it was thrust upon him when his father vanished under mysterious circumstances. Unbeknownst to anyone besides Kane, his father left instructions to his son that led Kane to the Soul Trap, a powerful supernatural treasure that allows him to hunt down, capture, and send ghosts from the earthly realm to the afterlife. For Kane, power over the supernatural has come with a price. Despite his attempts to do good with this power, his efforts often leave a path of destruction. So when his paranormal side-job attracts the attention of Eva Kells, a crack reporter intent on breaking his story, Kane is reluctant can he trust her? Soon, though, risking his heart on a snooping journalist is the least of Kane’s worries. He receives a call from a terrified priest whose church is haunted by the soul of a deceased little boy. Kane takes on the case, but as he begins to learn the strange details surrounding the boy’s death, he realizes that there’s much more at stake than he ever could have imagined. And to complicate things even further, he falls hard for the boy’s mother. The only problem is, she’s been dead for almost fifty years . . .

F.M. Christensen,Pornography: The Other Side,,English,,"A unique and important book. I have never read any work which analyzes the subject in such a manner. This book is more thorough and has a more liberated point of view than others which attempt to tackle this `hot potato' of the 1980s. Men should read this book. Women should read this book.Karen DeCrow, former President, NOWThis study slices like a laser through all the fog of rhetoric, disinformation, bias, and fear that has long enveloped all discussions of the subject of pornography in the US. No argument in favor of the censorship of such material can be considered valid unless the basic arguments of this study are answered. . . . This is a valuable resource for all academic libraries and could well become a fundamental weapon in the war to preserve the First Amendment. This book should be purchased by all but the smallest libraries; it may well be the most honest discussion of the subject ever written. ChoiceIn the continuing debate over pornography, two arguments stand out: that it is evil and should be censored, or that it is evil but censorship is a greater evil. F. M. Christensen presents the other side of this debate in what will surely be one of the most controversial books on the subject. Pornography: The Other Side convincingly argues that anti-pornography campaigns are themselves morally evil. The author defends this startling claim with a scientific persuasiveness. He successfully opens the pornography debate to include the whole picture, allowing the reader to grasp another side to this ongoing debate with concise, practical arguments. Students and scholars of all the social sciences, as well as the informed general reader, will find Pornography: The Other Side a source of stimulating ideas.Christensen concludes that pornography itself is not the fundamental issue for those who oppose it. Vehement opposition to pornography, according to this book, is a symptom of tragically mistaken beliefs about sex. What this book is really about, writes the author, is sex--and the evil effects on the lives of all of us which irrational attitudes toward that subject continue to have.",,,05/01/90,May 7th 1990,[],Paperback,[],,9780313360572,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347368571l/6850757.jpg,0.0,[],47.0,1.0,,6850757-pornography,,,,,,0.0,188,,Praeger Publishers,[],,,[],,

Faiz King (Goodreads Author),"God, the Evolver: A Secular Approach to the Divine",,,,"God The Evolver: A Secular Approach to the Divine Too Evolved To Believe In God? Discover The Spiritual Successor To ""The Origin Of Species."" Religion and science have been fighting an undeclared war for centuries. Ever since we stepped out of the dark ages and modern science started taking its first baby steps, people have been debating the connection between metaphysics and physics. And human evolution is one of the most controversial issues. Until now. This eye- opening book will offer you an in-depth understanding of evolution from a religio-scientific point of view. God The Evolver - Bridging The Gap Between Metaphysics & Science! If you are a serious free thinker without any religious or scientific prejudices, then this book is for you. If you are not afraid to step into spiritual no-man's land and test your knowledge, then this book will offer you a game-changing perspective. By combining religion, philosophy and science, author Faiz King has created a comprehensive guide to the struggle of religion and science. What Makes The Human Mind So Special? Back To Metaphysics. By the end of this book you will be able to understand the debate and realize that higher-order religious processes (e.g. Metaphysics) are necessary to realize the full extent of the rational and abstract properties of our human mind. And that's exactly what sets us apart from the rest of the creatures that live on this planet. God's Plan - How To Understand Centuries Of Evolution. After over 20 years of meticulous research, Faiz King has created the definitive successor to Charles Darwin's ""The Origin Of Species"" that is not afraid to take on this science giant and prove that Metaphysics (and subsequently God) is behind the development of modern science as we know it.

Fandy Hutari (Goodreads Author),Sandiwara dan Perang: Politisasi Terhadap Aktifitas Sandiwara Modern Masa Jepang,,Indonesian,,"FRAGMEN sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang terkuak dan memiliki arti dalam buku ini. Studi Fandy Hutari seperti menggenapi kerja H.B. Jassin dalam studi Kesusastraan di Masa Jepang (1969). Masa pendudukan Jepang (1942--1945) kerap diklaim sebagai masa menentukan untuk perubahan nasib kesusastraan dan sandiwara. A. Teeuw, Ajip Rosidi, Jakob Sumardjo, dan H.B. Jassin mengakui bahwa masa pendek itu telah memberi ruh lain dalam pembentukan sastra Indonesia modern. Bagaimana dengan nasib sandiwara?Peringatan H.B. Jassin (1969: 7): ""Menafikan kesusastraan dalam zaman Jepang adalah menafikan suatu wajah kehidupan dalam perjalanan membentuk sejarah."" Peringatan itu pantas menjadi dalil untuk kehadiran buku Sandiwara dan Perang sebagai studi atas nasib sandiwara dalam masa pendudukan Jepang. Penulis buku ini mengakui sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang tak mungkin diabaikan dalam alur sejarah teater Indonesia modern.Sandiwara pada masa itu kental dengan intervensi kekuasaan untuk propaganda. Wajah politis itu kerap terpinggirkan dan terabaikan dalam sejarah sandiwara modern Indonesia. Fandy Hutari dengan teliti mendata dan menafsirkan dalam konteks zaman 1940-an untuk mengetahui proses pembentukan sandiwara Indonesia modern dalam bayang-bayang kolonial.Penulis menelusuri sejarah sandiwara mulai dari 1925--1941 sebelum sampai pada fokus nasib sandiwara pada masa pendudukan Jepang. Tahun 1925 diakui penulis sebagai fase menentukan untuk pembaruan dalam jagat sandiwara. Pembaruan itu sebagai pembeda atas zaman stambul atau opera. Contoh pembaruan tampak pada Perkumpulan Sandiwara Miss Riboet Orion (1925) dengan pimpinan Tio Tek Djien dan Perkumpulan Sandiwara The Malay Opera Dardanella (1926) dengan pimpinan A. Piedro. Dua kelompok sandiwara itu terlibat dalam persaingan sengit untuk meraih perhatian publik dengan garapan pertunjukan modern.Pendudukan Jepang tahun 1942 menjadi titik balik untuk kehidupan sandiwara dalam wajah lain. Jepang memakai propaganda sebagai dalil untuk legitimasi kekuasaan. Sendenbu (Departemen Propaganda) dibentuk untuk menagani sistem dan operasionalisasi propaganda dengan memanfaatkan fil, surat kabar, pamflet, buku, poster, foto, siaran radio, pidato, seni pertunjukkan tradisional, dan seni sandiwara modern.Fandy Hutari menafsirkan bahwa sandiwara modern dipilih sebagai alat propaganda karena dapat menggelorakan perasaan orang banyak. Penguatan untuk propaganda dalam sandiwara tampak kentara mulai tahun 1944--1945.Sendenbu dalam praktek propaganda dibantu Keimin Bunka Shidoso (Kantor Pusat Kebudayaan) dengan tugas: (1) mempromosikan kesenian-kesenian tradisional Indonesia; (2) mendidik dan melatih seniman-seniman Indonesia; (3) memperkenalkan dan menyebarkan kebudayaan Jepang. Realisasi dari kerja Sendenbu itu adalah pendirian Sekolah Tonil di Jakarta pada tahun 1942. Sekolah ini memiliki tujuan mendidik penulis naskah profesional, aktor, dan kerabat sandiwara dengan orientasi untuk propaganda.Beberapa catatan menyebutkan bahwa sejak 1942 sandiwara seperti menemukan ruh kembali untuk mengisi fragmen sejarah Indonesia. Armijn Pane menengarai kebangkitan itu mendapati pengaruh dari program propaganda Jepang.Perkumpulan sandiwara pun tumbuh dengan gairah zaman antara lain Tjahaja Asia, Bintang Soerabaja, Dewi Mada, Tjahaja Timoer, Bintang Warnasari, Sinar Sari, Persafi, dan Maya. Perkumpulan Sandiwara Penggemar Maya berdiri pada 27 Mei 1944 dengan tokoh Usmar Ismail, El Hakim (Aboe Hanifah), Rosihan Anwar, D. Djajakoesoema, dan Surjo Soemanto. Kelompok ini jadi bukti pembaruan sandiwara modern di Indonesia meski susah melepaskan diri dari pengaruh kolonial Jepang dengan dalil propaganda.Konsep dan teknik propaganda dalam masa Jepang dijelaskan Fandy Hutari dalam tiga media: (1) Propaganda dalam pertunjukkan perkumpulan sandiwara; (2) propaganda melalui siaran sandiwara radio; dan (3) pesan propaganda dalam naskah lakon sandiwara.Dalil propaganda itu kentara dalam pengumuman di koran Asia Raya (20 September 1943) mengenai sayembara mengarang cerita sandiwara oleh Keimin Bunka Shidosho. Tema sayembara adalah anjuran tentang semangat cinta tanah air, keikhalasan berkorban demi kepentingan umum, dan semangat membela tanah air. Pemenang sayembara: F.A. Tamboenan (Poesaka Sedjati dari Seorang Ajah), J. Hoetagalung (Koeli dan Roomusya), A.M. Soekma Rahayoe (Banteng Bererong), S. Yamamato (Kemenangan Tertanggoeng), R. Srimoertono (Penginapan Noesantara), dan Nakao Masakozu (Seroean Zaman).

Her school life is full of whispers and lies — Hélène weighs 216; she smells like BO. Her loving mother is too tired to be any help. Fortunately, Hélène has one consolation, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre. Hélène identifies strongly with Jane’s tribulations, and when she is lost in the pages of this wonderful book, she is able to ignore her tormentors. But when Hélène is humiliated on a class trip in front of her entire grade, she needs more than a fictional character to allow her to see herself as a person deserving of laughter and friendship.Leaving the outcasts’ tent one night, Hélène encounters a fox, a beautiful creature with whom she shares a moment of connection. But when Suzanne Lipsky frightens the fox away, insisting that it must be rabid, Hélène’s despair becomes even more pronounced: now she believes that only a diseased and dangerous creature would ever voluntarily approach her. But then a new girl joins the outcasts’ circle, Géraldine, who does not even appear to notice that she is in danger of becoming an outcast herself. And before long Hélène realizes that the less time she spends worrying about what the other girls say is wrong with her, the more able she is to believe that there is nothing wrong at all.This emotionally honest and visually stunning graphic novel reveals the casual brutality of which children are capable, but also assures readers that redemption can be found through connecting with another, whether the other is a friend, a fictional character or even, amazingly, a fox.",,,October 23rd 2012,September 1st 2013,['Jane Eyre'],Hardcover,"['Graphic Novels', 'Young Adult', 'Comics', 'Middle Grade', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Picture Books', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Bande Dessinée']",,9781554983605,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361785734l/17214302.jpg,4.0,"['Prix Bédéis Causa (2013)', 'Prix Lux for Grand Prix (2013)', ""Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Young Reader's Book (2014)"", 'Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards Nominee for Best Publication for Kids (ages 8-12) (2014)', ""Canadian Children's Literature Award Nominee for French Language (2013)"", 'Joe Shuster Awards (2013)', 'Openbook好書獎 for 最佳青少年圖書 (2017)']",46.0,1.0,,17214302-jane-the-fox-and-me,,,,,93.0,9308.0,104,,Groundwood Books,"['3470', '3276', '1900', '412', '250']",,,[],,
Fanny Burney,"Evelina, Or, The History of a Young Lady's Entrance Into the World",,,Fiction,"'Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me to the coach, talking all the way of the honour I had done him! O these fashionable people!' Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions - as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story. The new introduction and full notes to this edition help make this richness all the more readily available to a modern reader.",,,,2002.0,,,,0192840312,9780192840318,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F-aBwgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.66,,,,,,,,,,,,455.0,,,,11701.0,,,,

Farah Mendlesohn,Diana Wynne Jones,Children's Literature and the Fantastic Tradition,,Biography & Autobiography,"This study follows the aesthetic of the sublime from Burke and Kant, through Wordsworth and the Shelleys, into Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot and Hardy. Exploring the continuities between the romantic and Victorian ""periods"" that have so often been rather read as differences, the book demonstrate that the sublime mode enables the transition from a paradigm of overwhelming power exemplified by the body of the king to the pervasive power of surveillance utilized by the rising middle classes. While the domestic woman connected with the rise of the middle class is normally seen as beautiful, the book contends that the moral authority given to this icon of depth and interiority is actually sublime. The binary of the beautiful and the sublime seeks to contain the sublimity of womanhood by insisting on sublimity's masculine character. This is the book's most important claim: rather than exemplifying masculine strength, the sublime marks the transition to a system of power gendered as feminine and yet masks that transition because it fears the power it ostensibly accords to the feminine. This aesthetic is both an inheritance the Victorians receive from their romantic predecessors, and, more importantly, a broad historical phenomenon that questions the artificial boundaries between romantic and Victorian.",,,,2005.0,,,,0415970237,9780415970235,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0NVlQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.09,,,,,,,,,,,,240.0,,,,46.0,,,,

Fatima Farheen Mirza (Goodreads Author),A Place for Us,,English,,"A Place for Us unfolds the lives of an Indian-American Muslim family, gathered together in their Californian hometown to celebrate the eldest daughter, Hadia's, wedding - a match of love rather than tradition. It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son's estrangement - the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from.In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, A Place For Us charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.A deeply affecting and resonant story, A Place for Us is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.",,,,June 12th 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Family', 'Adult', 'India', 'Book Club', 'Novels']",,9781524763558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517006183l/36840397.jpg,4.15,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction and for Debut Author (2018)', 'Reading Women Award Nominee for Fiction (2018)']",193.0,2.0,,36840397-a-place-for-us,,,,,95.0,41131.0,385,,SJP for Hogarth,"['17225', '15435', '6387', '1580', '504']",,,[],,

Federico Moccia,Tre metri sopra il cielo,,Italian,,"Una grande storia d'amore. Un microcosmo di giovani vite arrabbiate che cerca di staccarsi da terra, di camminare ""tre metri sopra il cielo"". Le ragazze vestono Onyx, o qualunque sia l'ultima griffe in fatto di body, parlano di Avant, di Marsan e delle mode dell'ultimo minuto. I ragazzi invece girano in moto. Le ragazze si preparano a incontrare il ragazzo della loro vita. I ragazzi si sfidano in prove di resistenza fisica, di velocità, di rischio. Fino all'ultimo respiro. SUllo sfondo di una frenetica vita di clan, di banda (il mitico gruppo dei budokani: Schello, Pollo, Lucone), Step e Babi si incontrano. Babi è un'ottima studentessa, Step è un violento, un picchiatore, uno che passa i pomeriggi davanti al bar con gli amici o in palestra e la sera sulla moto o nella bisca dove si gioca a biliardo. Appartengono a due mondi diversi, ma finiscono per innamorarsi. Non è un rapporto semplice perché nessuno dei due cede facilmente. Eppure si trasformano. Babi è irriconoscibile agli occhi dei genitori. Step rivela aspetti che ben poco collimano con la sua immagine, faticosamente costruita, di superduro. E, in effetti, muscoli, palestra e violenza nascondono un trauma, un nodo irrisolto.Tre metri sopra il cielo è un romanzo di vite quotidiane, una commedia romantica, un ritratto moviemntatissimo di adolescenti allo sbando.Pubblicato da un piccolo editore romano, è circolato per anni in fotocopie, diventando un cult fra i giovani della capitale.""Il sole sta salendo, è una bella mattinata. Babi sta andando a scuola, Step non è ancora andato a dormire dalla notte prima. Un giorno come un altro. Ma al semaforo si trovano uno accanto all'altra.

Federico Moccia,Scusa ma ti chiamo amore,,Italian,,"Niki e le sue amiche sono all'ultimo anno di scuola. Malgrado abbiano la maturità ne combinano ogni giorno di tutti i colori. Sfilate, feste, rave e tutti i possibili eventi anche fuori Roma. Alex è un ""ragazzo"" di quasi trentasette anni. Si è lasciato da poco e senza un vero perché con la sua fidanzata storica. Intorno a lui ruota un mondo complicato e divertente: i suoi genitori, le sue sorelle sposate e con figli e poi i suoi tre amici Enrico, Flavio e Pietro, anche loro tutti già sposati ma ognuno con le proprie particolarità. Enrico è geloso, Flavio metodico, Pietro invece è in fissa con tutte le donne del mondo. Alex è un pubblicitario e ha delle grandi responsabilità all'interno della sua azienda. Ma è appena arrivato un giovane rampante che mette a repentaglio il suo lavoro. E tutto questo non sarebbe niente se quella mattina Alex non incontrasse Niki. O meglio, se i due non si scontrassero. Niki è una bella ragazza, è divertente, è intelligente, è spiritosa, è allegra. C'è solo un piccolo dettaglio. Ha diciassette anni. Vent'anni meno di Alex. E dopo l'incontro di quella mattina, nulla sarà più come prima. Il mondo adulto si scontra con quello degli adolescenti. Ed ecco mamme e figlie in una discussione continua, papà che sono ancora ragazzini e ragazzi giovanissimi che sono già troppo adulti. E ancora ragazze sognatrici, ragazze deluse, ragazze romantiche e ragazze troppo folli. E adulti che invece hanno messo da parte tutti i loro sogni e vivono, o meglio sopravvivono, senza avere il coraggio di fermarsi a riflettere. Questo romanzo è la voglia di ritrovare la propria libertà, la voglia di avere sentimenti veri, di amare senza convenzioni e senza troppi perché. È la quotidianità ma è anche il sogno. È la voglia di dire basta a quel domani che ogni giorno ci raccontiamo, nel quale siamo sempre sicuri che faremo qualcosa di speciale. Ma intanto i giorni passano e quel domani non arriva. Di lui non c'è traccia. E allora ecco la nostra fuga, la più bella, la più folle, la più pazza. Una fuga d'amore. E poi quel faro. Insomma, un tuffo dove l'acqua è più blu.

Felix Abt (Goodreads Author),A Capitalist in North Korea: My Seven Years in the Hermit Kingdom,,English,,"Business in North Korea: a paradoxical and fascinating situation is interpreted by a true insider.In 2002, the Swiss-Swedish power company ABB appointed Felix Abt its country director for North Korea. The Swiss Entrepreneur lived and worked in North Korea for seven years, one of the few foreign businessmen there. After the experience, Abt felt compelled to write A Capitalist in North Korea to describe the multifaceted society he encountered. North Korea, at the time, was heavily sanctioned by the UN, which made it extremely difficult to do business. Yet, he discovered that it was a place where plastic surgery and South Korean TV dramas were wildly popular and where he rarely needed to walk more than a block to grab a quick hamburger. He was closely monitored, and once faced accusations of spying, yet he learned that young North Koreans are hopeful - signing up for business courses in anticipation of a brighter, more open, future. In A Capitalist in North Korea, Abt shares these and many other unusual facts and insights about one of the world's most secretive nations.Author Felix Abt is a politically neutral businessman and, therefore, does not share partisan views about North Korea. He is, however, critical of unfair North Korea reporting and does what he can to contribute to a more objective view of a country he knows much better than the journalists and bloggers writing about it. Abt is a former investor at several legitimate Joint Venture companies in North Korea which are now being driven into bankruptcy by U.N.

"Felix Gilman (Goodreads Author), Robert Waliś (Translator)",Gromowładny,,Polish,,"GROMOWŁADNY to egzotyczna powieść w stylu Borgesa, która nawet na chwilę nie traci tempa i nie rozczarowuje.Miasto, prawdziwe bądź wymyślone, pojawia się w wielu gatunkach powieści fantastycznych, zwłaszcza w literaturze urban fantasy. Jednak niewiele fikcyjnych powieści w prawdziwie ekstrawagancki sposób czci, odkrywa i bada miasta; rzadko kiedy miasto przestaje być jedynie dekoracją, a staje się pełnoprawnym bohaterem. Na myśl przychodzą Bellona Delany’ego, New Crobuzon Miéville’a, Viriconium Harrisona, Ambergris VanderMeera, Gormenghast Peake’a, Lankhmar Leibera czy niezliczone wizje Londynu autorstwa Moorcocka.

Kwestie ekonomiczne i społeczno-polityczne zostały przedstawione w solidny i wiarygodny sposób. Poszczególne warstwy miasta są traktowane z należytą uwagą.

Mungkin, sebagian dari kamu akan menjawab, “Jangan sampe deh!”. Tapi, bagi seorang ko-ass atau asisten dokter, mereka harus siap di tempatkan di mana saja, termasuk di rumah sakit jiwa.Hal inilah yang dialami Riva. Waktu kecil, Riva emang udah akrab dengan kata-kata gila. Karena itulah, saat ia harus ko-ass di ilmu kedokteran jiwa, ia sangat takut ketemu orang-orang berpenyakit jiwa ini, khususnya mereka yang mengidap skizofrenia.Begitu Riva sampai di tempat itu, ia pun disuruh untuk memeriksa beberapa pasien sakit jiwa yang udah menantinya. Satu masukan berharga yang ia dapatkan dari Budi—teman satu ko-assnya—adalah belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila!Akhirnya, Riva pun mengikuti saran Budi. Memang sih, saran itu benar-benar manjur dan ampuh. Terbukti, semua pasien yang ia tangani ternyata pada nurut semua, bahkan mereka tertawa dan bersikap begitu baik terhadapnya.Sayang, apa yang telah dilakukan Riva—nyanyi-nyanyi, lompat-lompat, dan menari-nari seperti orang gila—di hadapan pasiennya, ternyata sangat jauh dari bayangan suksesnya teori ‘belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila’. Karena, yang ia hadapi saat itu adalah pasien depresi ringan.Jelas aja mereka, bisa secepat itu tertawa. Coba kalau mereka adalah pasien skizofrenia yang benar-benar parah. Mungkin, belagak gila udah nggak akan mempan lagi!Menghadapi pasien sakit jiwa ini hanyalah salah satu pengalaman konyol dan aneh Ferdiriva Hamzah atau Riva saat ko-ass. Masih banyak pengalaman gokil lainnya yang bisa kamu temukan dalam buku Cado-Cado; Catatan Dodol Calon Dokter yang diterbitkan oleh Bukuné.Selama ko-ass itu, Riva harus menghadapi berbagai macam tingkah dari pasien-pasiennya. Ada yang pemarah, pemalu, periang, penggerutu, dan sebagainya. Mulai dari merawat pasien sakit jiwa, menghadapi pasien waria yang centil-centil, sampe pasien preman pernah dilalui Riva.

Fernanda Torres,Fim,,Portuguese,,"O público brasileiro acostumou-se a ver Fernanda Torres no cinema, no teatro ou na televisão. Em filmes premiados, novelas ou séries globais, ela se firmou como uma das mais versáteis atrizes brasileiras, capaz de atuar num arco dramático que vai da comédia escrachada ao denso drama psicológico.Em anos recentes, Fernanda começou a atuar na imprensa, em colunas no jornal Folha de S.Paulo, na Veja Rio e em colaborações para a revista piauí. Com Fim, seu primeiro romance, ela consolida sua transição para o universo das letras e mostra que nesse âmbito é uma artista tão completa quanto no palco ou diante das câmeras.O livro focaliza a história de um grupo de cinco amigos cariocas. Eles rememoram as passagens marcantes de suas vidas: festas, casamentos, separações, manias, inibições, arrependimentos.Álvaro vive sozinho, passa o tempo de médico em médico e não suporta a ex-mulher. Sílvio é um junkie que não larga os excessos de droga e sexo nem na velhice. Ribeiro é um rato de praia atlético que ganhou sobrevida sexual com o Viagra. Neto é o careta da turma, marido fiel até os últimos dias. E Ciro, o Don Juan invejado por todos - mas o primeiro a morrer, abatido por um câncer. São figuras muito diferentes, mas que partilham não apenas o fato de estar no extremo da vida, como também a limitação de horizontes. Sucesso na carreira, realização pessoal e serenidade estão fora de questão - ninguém parece ser capaz de colher, no fim das contas, mais do que um inventário de frustrações.Ao redor deles pairam mulheres neuróticas, amargas, sedutoras, desencanadas, descartadas, conformadas. Paira também um padre em crise com a própria vocação e um séquito de tipos cariocas frutos da arguta capacidade de observação da autora.Há graça, sexo, sol e praia nas páginas de Fim.

Fernando Pessoa,El banquero anarquista,,Spanish,,"Vertebrado casi a manera de diálogo socrático inverso. ""El banquero anarquista"", del poeta portugués Fernando Pessoa, lleva hasta el paroxismo el desarrollo de un razonamiento sofista -es decir de una especulación inteligente, pero utilitaria, travestida de pensamiento. A la evidente nunca innecesaria reflexión sobre el lugar del poder en la sociedad actual -que también sería una reflexión sobre la violencia establecida como realidad social y económica-, el Pessoa de ""El banquero anarquista"" remite también al albedrío de los individuos. Cuestiona el poder vertical, a la par que acepta su existencia como algo de lo que vale la pena escapar -lo cual sólo puede acontecer, según el sofista, con sus propias armas y herramientas. Al tocar el tema de la riqueza en tanto meta de nuestra sociedad advierte, no sin cruenta paradoja, que en la acumulación de riquezas reside cuando menos la ilusión de una salida individual a la presión social.

Faptul că a scris enorm de mult, în mai multe genuri literare, sub câteva zeci de nume diferite încă nu ar fi fost decât o excepţională performanţă cantitativă. Dar ambiţia de a-şi multiplica propria personalitate într-un proces de permanente transmutări, pare ea însăşi o «fugă» pe care numai limita biologică a putut-o opri.

"Fernando Pessoa, Edwin Honig (Editor), Susan M. Brown (Editor)",Poems of Fernando Pessoa,,English,,"""At last, at last, at last, Pessoa again! More Pessoa! One of the very great poets of the twentieth century, again and more! And one of the fascinating figures of all literature, with his manifold identities, his amazing audacities, his brilliance and his shyness. I think I have under control the reluctance I feel in having to share Pessoa with the public he should have had all along in America: until now, only the poets, so far as I can tell, have even heard of him, and delighted and exulted in him. He is, in some ways, the poet of modernism, the only one willing to fracture himself into the parcels of action, anguish, and nostalgia which are the grounds of our actual situation."" —C. K. Williams""Pessoa is one of the great originals (a fact rendered more striking by his writing as several distinct personalities) of the European poetry of the first part of this century, and has been one of the last poets of comparable stature, in the European languages, to become known in English. Edwin Honig's translations of Spanish and Portuguese poetry have been known to anyone who cares about either, since his work on Lorca in the forties, and his Selected Poems of Pessoa (1971) was a welcome step toward a long-awaited larger colection."" — W. S. Merwin""Fernando Pessoa is the least known of the masters of the twentieth-century poetry. From his heteronymic passion he produced, if that is the word, two of our greatest poets, Alberto Caeiro and Álvaro de Campos, and a third, Ricardo Reis, who isn't bad. Pessoa is the exemplary poet of the self as other, of the poem as testament to unreality, proclamation of nothingness, occasion for expectancy. In Edwin Honig's and Susan Brown's superb translations, Pessoa and his ""others"" live with miraculous style and vitality."" —Mark StrandFernando Pessoa is Portugal’s most important contemporary poet. He wrote under several identities, which he called heteronyms: Albet Caeiro, Alvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, and Bernardo Soares. He wrote sublime poetry under his own name as well, and each of his “voices” is completely different in subject, temperament, and style.

In it, the orphaned Francis Marion Tarwater and his cousins, the schoolteacher Rayber, defy the prophecy of their dead uncle--that Tarwater will become a prophet and will baptize Rayber's young son, Bishop. A series of struggles ensues: Tarwater fights an internal battle against his innate faith and the voices calling him to be a prophet while Rayber tries to draw Tarwater into a more ""reasonable"" modern world. Both wrestle with the legacy of their dead relatives and lay claim to Bishop's soul.O'Connor observes all this with an astonishing combination of irony and compassion, humor and pathos, resulting in a novel where range and depth reveal a brilliant and innovative writers acutely alert to where the sacred lives and to where it does not.",,,,January 1st 1960,"['Francis Marion Tarwater', 'Mason Tarwater', 'George F.

"Flannery O'Connor, Sally Fitzgerald (Editor)",Collected Works: Wise Blood / A Good Man is Hard to Find / The Violent Bear it Away / Everything that Rises Must Converge / Essays and Letters,,English,,"In her short lifetime, Flannery O'Connor became one of the most distinctive American writers of the twentieth century. By birth a native of Georgia and a Roman Catholic, O'Connor depicts, in all its comic and horrendous incongruity, the limits of worldly wisdom and the mysteries of divine grace in the ""Christ-haunted"" Protestant South. This Library of America collection, the most comprehensive ever published, contains all of her novels and short-story collections, as well as nine other stories, eight of her most important essays, and a selection of 259 witty, spirited, and revealing letters, twenty-one published here for the first time.Her fiction brilliantly explores the human obsession with seemingly banal things. It might be a new hat or clean hogs or, for Hazel Motes, hero of Wise Blood (1952), an automobile. ""Nobody with a good car needs to be justified,"" Hazel assures himself while using its hood for a pulpit to preach his ""Church Without Christ."" As in O'Connor's subsequent work, the characters in this novel are driven to violence, even murder, and their strong vernacular endows them with the discomforting reality of next-door neighbors. ""In order to recognize a freak,"" she remarks in one of her essays, ""you have to have a conception of the whole man.""In the title story of her first, dazzling collection of stories, A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1955), the old grandmother discovers the comic irrelevance of good manners when she and her family meet up with the sinister Misfit, who claims there is ""no pleasure but meanness."" The terror of urban dislocation in ""The Artificial Nigger,"" the bizarre baptism in ""The River,"" or one-legged Hulga Hopewell's encounter with a Bible salesman in ""Good Country People""--these startling events give readers the uneasy sense of mysteries about to be revealed.Her second novel, The Violent Bear It Away (1960), casts the shadow of the Old Testament across a landscape of backwoods shacks, modern towns, and empty highways. Caught between the prophetic fury of his great-uncle and the unrelenting rationalism of his uncle, fourteen-year-old Francis Tarwater undergoes a terrifying trial of faith when he is commanded to baptize his idiot cousin.The nine stories in Everything That Rises Must Converge (1965) show O'Connor's powers at their height. The title story is a terrifying, heart-rending drama of familial and racial misunderstanding. ""Revelation"" and ""The Enduring Chill"" probe further into conflicts between parental figures and recalcitrant offspring, where as much tension is generated from quiet conversation as from the physical violence of gangsters and fanatics.",,,,1988,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Southern Gothic', 'Southern', 'Anthologies', 'Gothic', 'American']",,9780940450370,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412900634l/48462.jpg,4.51,[],94.0,1.0,,48462.Collected_Works,,,,,97.0,3147.0,1281,,Library of America,"['2046', '792', '223', '43', '43']",,,[],,

The story is a fictional narrative based on real events of the people at the bottom rung of society and the trials and tribulations they had to endure surviving war, famine, government collapse, communist take over, and ultimately immigration, not to mention personal family and religious issues. It is the story of struggling to find sanity in an increasingly insane world where real forces greater than the individual can change one’s fortunes and destiny in a blink of an eye. The main character, Ciprian Indre, does ultimately find his sanity and overcomes his crazy world in the most interesting and unexpected way, but not without paying a mighty price.

Fola (Goodreads Author),The Seed,,English,,"Throughout our lives, many things may lead us to forget who we truly are. Result? Slowly yet inevitably, cages and chains enslave our thoughts and slay our freedoms.Down the ages, men have thus fallen for hosts of illusions, confusions and fears - except for the seven dreamers whose stories this book contains.

The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, became part of the Constitution on December 15, 1791. Among the rights guaranteed by these amendments are freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and the right to trial by jury.

Fox Lehjika,"The Daily Quest: Conquering a Sound Body, a Sane Mind, and a Soft Heart",,,,"Life on earth is a dichotomic gamble. Either we live, or we die. If we die, the equation is solved. But if we are alive, there are two possibilities: either we are happy, or we are unhappy. If we are happy, there are little things to worry about and few questions to ask. If we are unhappy, there two possibilities: either we get to work to reverse our misfortune, or we bow to the challenge. If we give up trying, we can just sit and wait for the nature to take care of us and relegate life concerns until eventually death comes. If we are resilient and keep fighting for a better life, there are two possibilities: either we choose to be constructive, or we engage in destructive schemes. In either situation, we find ourselves faced with many questions and few or no answers. Some questions raising hope, some others striking fear and uncertainty. If we find answers, some solve our problem with no collateral damage to ourselves and to others; some other go the other way. In both cases, these answers can be like medication; curing some patients and hurting others, and sometime bringing both cure and harm at the same time! In some instances, we intend to do good, just to end up with harmful results. In some other cases, ill intentions result in something good. In all these situations, one thing remains a constant; that is, nothing is certain and there is no guarantee that the next hour will find us in physical, mental, and emotional shape to face the next challenges or seize new opportunities. The search for such certainty is elusive, which makes it a Daily Quest. On the one hand, were there a onetime answer to these concerns, a onetime price could be paid, and the problem could be settled once and for all. But, just as these life pressing questions spawn at the time we wake up and follow us for the rest of the day, they need to be answered on daily basis, and the likely answers require a sustained daily exercise involving our body, mind, and heart. The purpose of this book is not to offer answers to the many life’s questions. Rather, this essay presents and describes the natural and powerful, but often overlooked tools the nature has afforded us and which we need in our Daily Quest. These gears are the Power of thought concentrated, the power of critical thinking, and the power of prayer. They are intrinsically related to our physical body, our mind, and our emotions. We all practice them, but not in a way to harness their tremendous transformative qualities. The author strongly believes that by systematizing the use of these tools in our daily life, we can enhance our ability to appreciate the dissonances of life and meet our challenges and opportunities with happiness and success. Therefore, this book will make sense to the reader only to the extent that s/he tries first hand the exercises here explained. Every effort is a step in a good direction. The Quest is an individual and a daily undertaking.

"Frances Burney, Edward A. Bloom (Editor)",Evelina,,English,,"Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions--as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story.

Frances Hodgson Burnett,The Secret Garden,,English,,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood.

Frances Hodgson Burnett,That Lass O'Lowrie's,,English,,"The Lancashire village of Riggan is dominated by the pit, for it not only provides employment to most of those who live there, but is also a focus for the community's hopes and fears, and the place where friendships are made and lost. Joan Lowrie, one of the pit girls, has endured hardship, and beatings from her father, for as long as she can remember, but her pride, determination to rise above her lot, and natural intelligence make her stand apart from the other girls. So it is Joan who comes to the rescue of seventeen-year-old Liz, left to care for her young baby alone and taunted by the others. And it is Joan who attracts the attention of two very different men: Paul Grace, the local curate, longs to help her, but finds himself unable to master his shyness and reach her; his friend Fergus Derrick, the mining engineer, is also intrigued by her. Then the new vicar's daughter, Anice Barholm, whom Grace loves with a gentle passion, comes to Riggan. Generous and warm, she is quickly taken into the heart of the community, and becomes firm friends with Fergus. As Paul sees the two drawn together in sympathetic understanding, he feels his own inadequacies underlined, and fears he may lose everything ....

Frances Itani,Deafening,,English,,"At the age of five, Grania-the daughter of hardworking Irish hoteliers in smalltown Ontario-emerges from a bout of scarlet fever profoundly deaf and is suddenly sealed off from the world that was just beginning to open for her. Her guilt-plagued mother cannot accept her daughter's deafness. Grania's saving grace is her grandmother Mamo, who tries to teach Grania to read and speak again. Grania's older sister, Tress, is a beloved ally as well-obliging when Grania begs her to shout words into her ear canals and forging a rope to keep the sisters connected from their separate beds at night when Grania fears the terrible vulnerability that darkness brings. When it becomes clear that she can no longer thrive in the world of the hearing, her family sends her to live at the Ontario School for the Deaf in Belleville, where, protected from the often-unforgiving hearing world outside, she learns sign language and speech.After graduation Grania stays on to work at the school, and it is there that she meets Jim Lloyd, a hearing man. In wonderment the two begin to create a new emotional vocabulary that encompasses both sound and silence. But just two weeks after their wedding, Jim must leave home to serve as a stretcher bearer on the blood-soaked battlefields of Flanders.During this long war of attrition, Jim and Grania's letters back and forth-both real and imagined-attempt to sustain their young love in a world as brutal as it is beautiful. Frances Itani's depiction of a world where sound exists only in the margins is a singular feat in literary fiction, a place difficult to leave and even harder to forget.

Frances Osborne,The Bolter,,English,,"She was irresistible. She inspired fiction, fantasy, legend, and art.Some say she was “the Bolter” of Nancy Mitford’s novel The Pursuit of Love. She “played” Iris Storm in Michael Arlen’s celebrated novel about fashionable London’s lost generation, The Green Hat, and Greta Garbo played her in A Woman of Affairs, the movie made from Arlen’s book. She was painted by Orpen; photographed by Beaton; she was the model for Molyneaux’s slinky wraparound dresses that became the look fo the age—the Jazz Age.Though not conventionally beautiful (she had a “shot-away chin”), Idina Sackville dazzled men and women alike, and made a habit of marrying whenever she fell in love—five husbands in all and lovers without number.Hers was the age of bolters, and Idina was the most celebrated of them all.Her father was the eighth Earl De La Warr. In a society that valued the antiquity of families and their money, hers was as old as a British family could be (eight hundred years earlier they had followed William the Conqueror from Normandy and been given enough land to live on forever . . . another ancestor, Lord De La Warr, rescued the starving Jamestown colonists in 1610, became governor of Virginia, and gave his name to the state of Delaware). Her mother’s money came from “trade”; Idina’s maternal grandfather had employed more men (85,000) than the British army and built one third of the world’s railroads.Idina’s first husband was a dazzling cavalry officer, one of the youngest, richest, and best-looking of the available bachelors, with “two million in cash.” They had a seven-story pied-à-terre on Connaught Place overlooking Marble Arch and Hyde Park, as well as three estates in Scotland. Idina had everything in place for a magnificent life, until the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand caused the newlyweds’ world—the world they’d assumed would last forever—to collapse in less than a year.Like Mitford’s Bolter, young Idina Sackville left her husband and children. But in truth it was her husband who wrecked their marriage, making Idina more a boltee than a bolter. Soon she found a lover of her own—the first of many—and plunged into a Jazz Age haze of morphine. She became a full-blown flapper, driving about London in her Hispano-Suiza, and pusing the boundaries of behavior to the breaking point. British society amy have adored eccentrics whose differences celebrated the values they cherished, but it did not embrace those who upset the order of things. And in 1918, just after the Armistice was signed, Idina Sackville bolted from her life in England and, setting out with her second husband, headed for Mombasa, in search of new adventure.Frances Osborne deftly tells the tale of her great-grandmother using Idina’s never-before-seen letters; the diaries of Idina’s first husband, Euan Wallace; and stories from family members. Osborne follows Idina from the champagne breakfasts and thé dansants of lost-generation England to the foothills of Kenya’s Aberdare moutnains and the wild abandon of her role in Kenya’s disintegration postwar upper-class life. A parade of lovers, a murdered husband, chaos everywhere—as her madcap world of excess darkened and crumbled around her.",,,January 1st 2008,June 2nd 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Africa', 'Kenya', 'Biography Memoir', 'British Literature', 'Historical', 'Memoir', 'Womens']",,9780307270146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320533098l/6437544.jpg,3.7,[],27.0,1.0,,6437544-the-bolter,,,,,90.0,3776.0,300,,Knopf,"['796', '1492', '1122', '288', '78']",,,"['Wanjohi Valley, Kenya']",,

These are useful skills in the lawless backcountry of Brazil, where ruthless land barons called ""colonels"" feud with bands of outlaw cangaceiros, trapping innocent residents in the cross fire.Emília, whose knowledge of the world comes from fashion magazines and romance novels, dreams of falling in love with a gentleman and escaping to a big city.Luzia also longs to escape their little town, where residents view her with suspicion and pity. Scarred by a childhood accident that left her with a deformed arm, the quick-tempered Luzia finds her escape in sewing and in secret prayers to the saints she believes once saved her life.But when Luzia is abducted by a group of cangaceiros led by the infamous Hawk, the sisters' quiet lives diverge in ways they never imagined. Emília stumbles into marriage with Degas Coelho, the son of a doctor whose wealth is rivaled only by his political power.She moves to the sprawling seaside city of Recife, where the glamour of her new life is soon overshadowed by heartache and loneliness. Luzia, forced to trek through scrubland and endure a nomadic existence, proves her determination to survive and begins to see the cangaceiros as comrades, not criminals.In Recife, Emília must hide any connection to her increasingly notorious sister. As she learns to navigate the treacherous waters of Brazilian high society, Emília sees the country split apart after a bitter presidential election. Political feuds extend to the countryside, where Luzia and the Hawk are forced to make unexpected alliances and endure betrayals that threaten to break the cangaceiros apart. But Luzia will overcome time and distance to entrust her sister with a great secret—one Emília vows to keep.

Nichols (Translator), Germaine Greer (Foreword by)",My Secret Book,,English,,"Written by one of the greatest poets of all time, My Secret Book, now in its first English translation, is a profound and deeply personal account of inner suffering and mental anguish. Deeply troubled by his struggle—and failure—to achieve spiritual perfection, Petrarch, considered the forefather of Italian humanism, sought catharsis in the writing of a “secret book.” Only here could he pour out his innermost thoughts, frustrations, and desires. Written in the form of a dialogue between himself and St. Augustine, the book wrestles with the universal themes of suffering, desire, fear, and joy. The result is a rare insight into Petrarch’s life and thought and a remarkable early example of self-revelation and autobiography.",,,11/06/78,October 1st 2002,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Poetry', 'Biography', 'Literature', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Medieval', 'Read For School']",,9781843910268,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328728926l/125984.jpg,3.89,[],92.0,1.0,,125984.My_Secret_Book,,,,,91.0,292.0,128,,Hesperus Press,"['93', '102', '72', '22', '3']",,,[],,

Francine Prose (Goodreads Author),The Lives of the Muses: Nine Women and the Artists They Inspired,,,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewIn the classical world, the muses -- all nine of them -- were daughters of Zeus who inspired poets, musicians, and other creative types to produce works of genius. Today, says Francine Prose, the word has been weakened and is used almost exclusively to refer to the chic women who help fashion designers inform their latest lines. But in her scholarly account, Prose (a National Book Award finalist for her novel 
  Blue Angel
) presents nine real women who moved men to greatness and who were not mere catalysts but worthy of note on their own, in many cases deserving a share of the credit for the work they helped create.Each chapter is a mini-biography of a woman's life and the way a male artist figured into it. We see the muse as prompter and creator in her own regard, like memoirist Hester Thrale, whose letters to Samuel Johnson helped form his later works. In Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the muse is at her most passive, asserting her independence of the child-loving author only by failing to remain seven years old forever. And with Yoko Ono, there is the muse as artist in her own right, who claimed not to have heard of the Beatles before meeting John Lennon, and whose avant-garde tendencies some blamed for his musical downfall.To hit the mystical nine, Prose stretches a bit. For every Suzanne Farrell collaborating on ballets with George Balanchine, or every Gala Dal� cosigning canvases with spouse Salvador, there are personae only a graduate student would be likely to know. We learn of ""serial muse"" Lou Andreas-Salom�'s involvement with Friedrich Nietzsche, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Sigmund Freud, and of how Charis Weston had to vie with a toilet for the attentions of her photographer husband, Edward. But these lesser-knowns help make the book a complete analysis of notable women who motivated men of achievement -- usually at the expense of their own -- and lived with the consequences. iKatherine Hottinger/i",,,09/01/02,October 7th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Art', 'History', 'Biography', 'Womens', 'Essays', 'Art History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Womens Studies']",,9780060555252,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410141618l/39939.jpg,3.72,[],97.0,1.0,,39939.The_Lives_of_the_Muses,,,,,89.0,843.0,448,,Harper Perennial,"['194', '329', '230', '67', '23']",,,[],,

"Francine Rivers (Goodreads Author), Richard Ferrone (Narrator)",A Voice in the Wind,,English,,"“The city was silently bloating in the hot sun, rotting like the thousands of bodies that lay where they had fallen in street battles.” With this opening sentence, A Voice in the Wind transports readers back to Jerusalem during the first Jewish-Roman War, some seventy years after the death of Christ. Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews, Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege, the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl, Hadassah, and Marcus, the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant’s family. Brought to Rome, she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings, but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone, she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless, impulsive, and villainous, Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia’s brother, Marcus, is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life, but also the gap between Hadassah’s unrelenting faith and Marcus’ lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously, Atretes, a captured soldier from Germania, is forced to become a gladiator. This is the time of Rome’s decline and the decadence of a civilization on the verge of self-destruction serves as a powerful backdrop to the Barbarian’s struggle for survival in the arena.",Mark of the Lion #1,,03/01/93,March 1st 1998,"['Atretes', 'Marcus Lucianus Valerian', 'Julia Valerian', 'Hadassah']",Paperback,"['Christian Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Christian Romance', 'Adult', 'Religion']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459567327l/95617.jpg,4.56,[],4242.0,51.0,,95617.A_Voice_in_the_Wind,,,,,96.0,75055.0,520,,Tyndale House Publishers,"['53802', '13672', '4638', '1551', '1392']",,,[],,

"Francis A. Schaeffer, J.I. Packer (Foreword), Lane T. Dennis (Preface)",The Francis A. Schaeffer Trilogy: The 3 Essential Books in 1 Volume/the God Who Is There/Escape from Reason/He Is There and He Is Not Silent,,English,,"Few Christians have had a greater impact during the last half of the twentieth century than Dr. Francis A. Schaeffer. A man with a remarkable breadth of cultural interest, with penetrating insight into modern life, and with a clear sense of spiritual reality, Schaeffer was also a man who cared deeply about people and their search for truth and reality in their lives.With the publication of this Trilogy, Dr. Schaeffer's three foundational books are available for the first time in one volume. Schaeffer himself considered these three books to be essential to everything he wrote (twenty-three books in all), and it is here especially that we see his ability to understand the deep need of modern man for truth, beauty, and meaning in life.In the first book, The God Who Is There, Schaeffer shows how modern thought has abandoned the idea of truth with tragic consequences in every area of culture-from philosophy, to art, to music, to theology, and within culture as a whole.Escape from Reason, the second book, explains especially how the disintegration of modern life and culture grows from corrupted roots that reach far into the past.In the last book, He Is There and He Is Not Silent, Schaeffer contrasts the silence and despair of modern life with the Christian answer that God can indeed be known because He is there and He is not silent. In addition to the convenience of having Schaeffer's three foundational books in one volume, the Trilogy is especially valuable in that it uses the text revised and updated by Schaeffer shortly before his death.Why was Schaeffer able to understand and communicate so effectively to a generation? The best way to know is to find out firsthand, by reading his essential works as found in this Trilogy.

Francis B. Colavita,"Sensation, Perception, and the Aging Process",,,,"In 24 fascinating lectures, Professor Francis Colavita offers a biopsychological perspective on the way we humans navigate and react to the world around us in a process that is ever-changing. Our experiences are vastly different today than they were when we were children and our senses and brains were still developing; and those experiences are becoming ever more different as we age, when natural changes alert us to the need to compensate, often in ways that are quite positive. For example, children have many more taste receptors than adults, so they are more taste sensitive. Therefore it's both ironic and understandable that children often prefer bland food drawn from a small list of favorites to avoid being overwhelmed. Adults, on the other hand, lose taste receptors as they age, so getting older often moves us in the opposite direction, prompting us to try new varieties of ethnic cuisines and spicier foods. One of the delights of this course is the balance of the real-life examples Professor Colavita gives and the crisp presentation of the physiological systems that explain those examples. How do our sensory systems gather and process raw information from the world, enabling us to see, hear, smell, taste, or touch? How do we keep our balance? Or understand exactly where we are in space, so that we can reach for our morning coffee cup and not close our hands around empty space? How do our bodies create motor memories that allow us to learn and then automatically perform the most complex tasks—such as the laboriously practiced elements of a golf swing—in one smoothly executed motion, or run through a series of rapid gear shifts while driving on a winding mountain road? What sort of sensory system allows us to feel pain but also works to protect us from its most intense levels? Whether exploring the complex structures of the brain or inner ear, explaining with compassion the animal experiments that have given us so much knowledge of sensory systems, or using humorous personal anecdotes to illustrate a point, Professor Colavita delivers a course that informs, entertains, and even prepares us for the changes that lie ahead.

In this confrontation with corruption, Ann Higgins stumbles into the underworld life of a high-ranking South Dakota statesman; and she catapults her psychiatrist, Troy Stoker, M.D., into the conflict. When her chilling discovery threatens to devastate a politician’s secret dominion, Ann ends up dangling from a makeshift noose and fighting for her survival, while plunging Dr. Stoker even deeper into the battle of minds, muscles and new tech.  Dr. Stoker enlists Errol Rivera, a fellow physician and military attaché to help unravel the mystery and take on the challenges set before them. Together Stoker and Rivera use their brilliant intuition, psychiatric savvy and military skills to pursue the veiled, corrupt politician and hunt down his criminal pack.  Still, Stoker is unaware that his Cuban-born, patriot friend, Rivera, is much more than a doctor with a hero’s past. At his command, Rivera unleashes an elite band of warriors who engage their training, guts, technology and weaponry to confront the corruption.  Hold on and jump into this gritty thrill ride as the new hero, Troy Stoker, M.D., emerges in an explosive new political and psychiatry thriller, American Jackal.  Who's Troy Stoker? He's a psychiatrist . But, to understand who Stoker is now, it helps to understand who he was as a rookie army medic circa 1992.  “I don’t give a damn if it’s an order or not an order. It’s just the right thing!” Stoker thought about his dilemma. “Let’s pull this jeep right up in front of his cozy little sunshade. You take over this wound! I can take an officer’s reprimand, but I can’t live with this man dying.”  Forty-five seconds later, the driver skidded the jeep to a stop right in front of the radio operator’s sunshade. “Call back that helicopter!” yelled Stoker as the driver jumped back to the patient and took over the first aid. “This man is about to die!”  “I can’t!” protested the radio operator, as he watched corporal Stoker jump out of the jeep with bloody hands. “I have orders from the general to—” Stoker’s gory hand reached for the radio and the operator lurched back in fear.  Stoker took over the radio and hit the transmit button. “Deathstalker, this is Medic Alpha Six. Over.”  A moment later, the pilot responded to Stoker’s call. “Medic Alpha Six, this is Deathstalker.”  “Roger,” Stoker said. “I’m a medic with an Airborne Ranger in critical condition, requesting you turn that helicopter around. I need medevac and I need that doctor. Over.”  “Standby, Medic Alpha Six,” came the pilot’s reply. Silently, Stoker waited and hoped. “That’s a roger, Medic Alpha Six.” Relief flooded through Stoker. “Ground control. This is Deathstalker. Landing site clear, over?” Stoker started to hand the blood-covered radio microphone back to the radio operator, but he would not touch it. So Stoker shoved the device to within three inches of the radio operator’s mouth, turned his head to glance at the empty landing zone, and started to key the microphone so the squeamish radio operator could issue the response.  Who is Stoker's mentor, Errol Rivera, M.D.? Now Colonel Rivera, he remembers some of his 1992 helicopter pilot history.","Troy Stoker, M.D. #1",,,August 31st 2014,[],Kindle Edition,['Thriller'],,B00N70RYRM,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423690170l/23160974.jpg,3.95,[],99.0,1.0,,23160974-american-jackal,,,,,88.0,77.0,570,,"Naoband, LLC","['33', '22', '13', '3', '6']",,,[],,
Francis Carsac,I Robinson del cosmo,,Italian,,"L'autore immagina che, in seguito a un cataclisma, un lembo di Terra si stacchi e venga trasportato su un altro pianeta, con tutte le sue case, le sue piante, i suoi animali e i suoi abitanti. E' un lembo di Francia, che si incorpora su un mondo chiamato dai sopravvissuti: Tellus, in memoria della Terra madre. Il romanzo narra, con stile vivido, seppur scarno e conciso, la storia di questi scampati (alcuni scienziati che facevano parte di un osservatorio, un centinaio di operai addetti a una fabbrica, e i pochi abitanti del paese e delle campagne intorno) che scoprono a poco a poco il nuovo pianeta, ne sfruttano le ricchezze, ne affrontano i pericoli, fanno conoscenza dei suoi abitanti e della sua fauna: esseri quasi umani simili a centauri, animali che sembrano scesi dalla nostra preistoria, altre bestie pericolosissime e completamente sconosciute, striscianti e volanti. La vita continua e, attraverso lotte interne, i nuovi Robinson del cosmo riescono a crearsi un nuovo mondo, cosi come i pionieri americani crearono con l'audacia, con la fatica, e spinti dal bisogno, città, macchine, coltivazioni: un mondo nuovo, una nuova civiltà. Dello stesso autore i lettori conoscono già il bellissimo romanzo ""Galassia maledetta"", pubblicato in questa collezione, e che costituisce la miglior presentazione per questa nuova fatica di Francis Carsac, considerato ormai un ""fuoriclasse"" nel genere fantascienza dalla critica francese e americana.A000040930",,,11/06/55,September 1st 1992,[],Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'France', 'Adventure']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455881940l/29223476._SY475_.jpg,4.01,[],84.0,1.0,,29223476-i-robinson-del-cosmo,,,,,91.0,146.0,278,,Perseo Libri,"['59', '44', '30', '12', '1']",,,[],,

It's crazy, if you think about it. The God of the universe—the Creator of nitrogen and pine needles, galaxies and E-minor—loves us with a radical, unconditional, self-sacrificing love. And what is our typical response? We go to church, sing songs, and try not to cuss. Whether you've verbalized it yet or not, we all know something's wrong. Does something deep inside your heart long to break free from the status quo? Are you hungry for an authentic faith that addresses the problems of our world with tangible, even radical, solutions? God is calling you to a passionate love relationship with Himself. Because the answer to religious complacency isn't working harder at a list of do's and don'ts-it's falling in love with God.

When the medical community can offer no answers, they turn to their Catholic Church. The Archbishop a prominent hawk in the war on Satan is more than willing to help the Wagners. Though in precarious health ( His bypasses had bypasses ), he always knew The Evil One would show up on his watch and he s now ready to send in the exorcists. But first, the Church has to determine whether Little Billy Wagner is demonically possessed. Enter the handsome Father Leopold Mackenzie. Father Leo wants to be a priest. He believes God wants him to be a good priest. He aspires to return to a parish in Bolivia where he spent many happy days in his favorite llama-wool sweater and was accepted by the kind Boliviano parishioners. To make this happen, he just needs to do a good job on the Billy Wagner matter and keep the lovely Veronica Fields, from the parish s conversion class, far away from him and in moments of weakness not think of ways to make her his rectory mate. Father Leo visits the Wagners and soon determines that Little Billy is clearly possessed, but, the question is, by what? Knowing an underlying medical cause must first be ruled out, Father Leo starts gathering information and medical reports and hires the famed Jesuit psychiatrist, the dhoti-wearing Father Caspar Wieland, MD/PhD/SJ. Meanwhile, the Archbishop gathers his exorcism team (including bringing in ex-special forces Monsignor Krebs, despite his handling of the exorcism in The River City Delirium Tremens Burro Incident ) and prepares to make the case to the Vatican to get the authority to send in the exorcists.

Francis Parker Yockey,Imperium,,English,,"This is Yockey's famous masterpiece. It is inspired by Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West.

It is divided into five parts, which are concerned with History, Politics, 'Cultural Vitalism', America and the World Situation. Imperium deals with doctrinal matters as well giving a survey of the 'world situation' in the 20th century. ""In this book,"" writes Yockey, ""are the precise, organic foundations of the Western soul, and in particular, its Imperative at the present stage."" ""...What is written here is also for the true America, even though the effective America of the moment, and of the immediate future is a hostile America, an America of willing, mass-minded tools in the service of the Culture-distorting political and total enemy of the Western Civilization."" ""The mission of this generation is the most difficult that has ever faced a Western generation. It must break the terror by which it is held in silence, it must look ahead, it must believe when there is apparently no hope, it must obey even if it means death, it must fight to the end rather than submit. ...The men of this generation must fight for the continued existence of the West..."" ""The soil of Europe, rendered sacred by the streams of blood which have made it spiritually fertile for a millennium, will once again stream with blood until the barbarians and distorters have been driven out and the Western banner waves on its home soil from Gibraltar to North Cape, from the rocky promontories of Galway to the Urals.""

"Franco Ferrucci, Raymond Rosenthal (Translator)",The Life of God (as Told by Himself),,English,,"At the center of Franco Ferrucci's inspired novel is a tender, troubled God. In the beginning is God's solitude, and because God is lonely he creates the world. He falls in love with earth, plunges into the oceans, lives as plant and reptile and bird. His every thought and mood serve to populate the planet, with consequences that run away from him—sometimes delightfully, sometimes unfortunately.When a new arrival emerges from the apes, God believes he has finally found the companion he needs to help him make sense of his unruly creation. Yet, as the centuries pass, God feels more and more out of place in the world he has created; by the close of his memoir, he is packing his bags.Highly praised and widely reviewed, The Life of God is a playful, wondrous, and irresistible book, recounting thousands of years of religious and philosophical thought.""A supreme but imperfect entity, the protagonist of this religiously enlightened and orthodoxically heretical novel is possessed by a raving love for his skewed, unbalanced world. . . .

Frank Baker,Miss Hargreaves,,English,,"When Norman Huntley and Henry Beddow, sheltering from the rain in a dismal Irish country church, placate the sexton by telling him that they knew of his beloved pastor (now departed), there is no reason to suppose that there is any harm in the invention. It is purely for their own amusement that they create a fictional mutual friend: an elderly lady, Miss Hargreaves... The sexton does not doubt her existence. For him, Miss Hargreaves is as real as you or I. And she gradually assumes a fully-rounded character in the imaginings of the two young men as they while away their holiday in expanding the details of her life: her book of poetry, her parrot Dr Pepusch, her harp, and her hip-bath. It is merely a continuation of their little joke when they write to invite her to visit them back in their cathedral home-town of Cornford. It is something of a surprise when Miss Hargreaves accepts their invitation. And their disbelief turns to confusion and horror as, one evening soon afterwards, her train pulls into Cornford Station . . . As Dr Glen Cavaliero stresses in his introduction, Miss Hargreaves is a brilliantly funny and moving fantasy with an admirable lightness of touch and wonderful characterisation, but for all that it has a dark and frightening undercurrent. A burlesque parable of 'the ways of God with man', the book explores how the creator must live with the consequences of their creation, no matter how uncomfortable. And if they renounce their responsibilities, then there is always the possibility that their power may be turned against them. Miss Hargreaves, first published in 1940 to great acclaim, is a classic novel of the supernatural.

Instead, Hatter must endure a non-stop quest, crisscrossing the globe for 13 years in search of the lost Princess. While formidable with blades, a moment must be taken to introduce his signature weapon, the Hat. Woven and blocked from a material not available in any realm except the origins of wonder, the Hat, when hurled by his expert hand, instantly unfolds into a circle of blades to attack or defend.The mad odyssey begins here...",Hatter M #1,,09/01/04,October 16th 2008,['Hatter Madigan'],Paperback,"['Graphic Novels', 'Fantasy', 'Comics', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Fairy Tales', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Retellings', 'Graphic Novels Comics']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179349l/3563478.jpg,3.6,[],72.0,1.0,,3563478-hatter-m-volume-1,,,,,85.0,2412.0,176,,Automatic Pictures,"['590', '712', '754', '273', '83']",,,[],,

Frank Belknap Long,Los Perros de Tíndalos,,Spanish,,"Los perros de Tíndalos habitan en el pasado lejano de la Tierra, cuando la vida normal no había avanzado aún a nada superior a los seres unicelulares. Se dice que habitan en los ángulos de tiempo, mientras que los demás seres (tales como la humanidad y toda la vida común) descienden de las curvas. Se piensa que son inmortales, y que persiguen a través del tiempo a los seres humanos y demás vida normal que llama su atención (habitualmente por realizar algún tipo de desplazamiento temporal). Su apariencia es desconocida porque los personajes que se encuentran con ellos no sobreviven el tiempo suficiente para dar una descripción. Se dice que tienen largas y huecas lenguas o probóscide para drenar los líquidos corporales de sus víctimas, y que excretan una extraña pus de color azul.Aunque los perros de Tíndalos son a veces dibujados como una criatura canina (probablemente debido al evocador título del primer relato en el que aparecieron), no es probable que luzcan como tal, ya que el nombre sólo refleja sus hábitos cazadores, no su apariencia. Algunas obras posteriores sugieren que su apariencia podría ser de un aspecto mucho más monstruoso y similar al de un murciélago.Debido a su relación con los ángulos de tiempo, los perros de Tíndalos pueden materializarse a través de cualquier ángulo, siempre que sea suficientemente cerrado (120º o menos).

Frank Brady,Endgame: Bobby Fischer's Remarkable Rise and Fall - From America's Brightest Prodigy to the Edge of Madness,,English,,"Endgame is acclaimed biographer Frank Brady’s decades-in-the-making tracing of the meteoric ascent—and confounding descent—of enigmatic genius Bobby Fischer.  Only Brady, who met Fischer when the prodigy was only 10 and shared with him some of his most dramatic triumphs, could have written this book, which has much to say about the nature of American celebrity and the distorting effects of fame.  Drawing from Fischer family archives, recently released FBI files, and Bobby’s own emails, this account is unique in that it limns Fischer’s entire life—an odyssey that took the Brooklyn-raised chess champion from an impoverished childhood to the covers of Time, Life and Newsweek to recognition as “the most famous man in the world” to notorious recluse. At first all one noticed was how gifted Fischer was.  Possessing a 181 I.Q. and remarkable powers of concentration, Bobby memorized hundreds of chess books in several languages, and he was only 13 when he became the youngest chess master in U.S. history.   But his strange behavior started early.  In 1972, at the historic Cold War showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he faced Soviet champion Boris Spassky, Fischer made headlines with hundreds of petty demands that nearly ended the competition.  It was merely a prelude to what was to come. Arriving back in the United States to a hero’s welcome, Bobby was mobbed wherever he went—a figure as exotic and improbable as any American pop culture had yet produced.  No player of a mere “board game” had ever ascended to such heights.  Commercial sponsorship offers poured in, ultimately topping $10 million—but Bobby demurred.  Instead, he began tithing his limited money to an apocalyptic religion and devouring anti-Semitic literature.   After years of poverty and a stint living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row, Bobby remerged in 1992 to play Spassky in a multi-million dollar rematch—but the experience only deepened a paranoia that had formed years earlier when he came to believe that the Soviets wanted him dead for taking away “their” title.  When the dust settled, Bobby was a wanted man—transformed into an international fugitive because of his decision to play in Montenegro despite U.S. sanctions.  Fearing for his life, traveling with bodyguards, and wearing a long leather coat to ward off knife attacks, Bobby lived the life of a celebrity fugitive – one drawn increasingly to the bizarre.  Mafiosi, Nazis, odd attempts to breed an heir who could perpetuate his chess-genius DNA—all are woven into his late-life tapestry.  And yet, as Brady shows, the most notable irony of Bobby Fischer’s strange descent – which had reached full plummet by 2005 when he turned down yet another multi-million dollar payday—is that despite his incomprehensible behavior, there were many who remained fiercely loyal to him.  Why that was so is at least partly the subject of this book—one that at last answers the question: “Who was Bobby Fischer?”",,,,February 1st 2011,['Bobby Fischer'],ebook,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Chess', 'History', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Games', 'American History', 'Psychology']",,9780307463920,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1299772242l/10290752.jpg,3.95,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)'],64.0,1.0,,10290752-endgame,,,,,91.0,9172.0,416,,Broadway Books,"['3334', '3229', '1766', '509', '334']",,,[],,

Frank Delaney,Tipperary,,English,,"“My wooing began in passion, was defined by violence and circumscribed by land; all these elements molded my soul.” So writes Charles O’Brien, the unforgettable hero of bestselling author Frank Delaney’s extraordinary new novel–a sweeping epic of obsession, profound devotion, and compelling history involving a turbulent era that would shape modern Ireland. Born into a respected Irish-Anglo family in 1860, Charles loves his native land and its long-suffering but irrepressible people. As a healer, he travels the countryside dispensing traditional cures while soaking up stories and legends of bygone times–and witnessing the painful, often violent birth of land-reform measures destined to lead to Irish independence.At the age of forty, summoned to Paris to treat his dying countryman–the infamous Oscar Wilde–Charles experiences the fateful moment of his life. In a chance encounter with a beautiful and determined young Englishwoman, eighteen-year-old April Burke, he is instantly and passionately smitten–but callously rejected. Vowing to improve himself, Charles returns to Ireland, where he undertakes the preservation of the great and abandoned estate of Tipperary, in whose shadow he has lived his whole life–and which, he discovers, may belong to April and her father. As Charles pursues his obsession, he writes the “History” of his own life and country. While doing so, he meets the great figures of the day, including Charles Parnell, William Butler Yeats, and George Bernard Shaw. And he also falls victim to less well-known characters–who prove far more dangerous. Tipperary also features a second “historian:” a present-day commentator, a retired and obscure history teacher who suddenly discovers that he has much at stake in the telling of Charles’s story.In this gloriously absorbing and utterly satisfying novel, a man’s passion for the woman he loves is twinned with his country’s emergence as a nation. With storytelling as sweeping and dramatic as the land itself, myth, fact, and fiction are all woven together with the power of the great nineteenth-century novelists. Tipperary once again proves Frank Delaney’s unrivaled mastery at bringing Irish history to life.

Frank E. Peretti,Illusion,,English,,"Dane and Mandy, a popular magic act for forty years, are tragically separated by a car wreck that claims Mandy's life -- or so everyone thinks. Even as Dane mourns and tries to rebuild his life without her, Mandy, supposedly dead, awakes in the present as the nineteen-year-old she was in 1970. Distraught and disoriented in what to her is the future, she is confined to a mental ward until she discovers a magical ability to pass invisibly through time and space to escape. Alone in a strange world, she uses her mysterious powers to eke out a living, performing magic on the streets and in a quaint coffee shop. Hoping to discover an exciting new talent, Dane ventures into the coffee shop and is transfixed by the magic he sees, illusions that even he, a seasoned professional, cannot explain. But more than anything, he is emotionally devastated by this teenager who has never met him, doesn't know him, is certainly not in love with him, but is in every respect identical to the young beauty he first met and married some forty years earlier.They begin a furtive relationship as mentor and protege, but even as Dane tries to sort out who she really is and she tries to understand why she is drawn to him, they are watched by secretive interests who not only possess the answers to Mandy's powers and misplacement in time but also the roguish ability to decide what will become of her.Frank Peretti has crafted a rich, rewarding story of love and life, loss and restoration, full of twists and mystery.

Frank Joseph Minichetti (Goodreads Author),School and My Bully Experience,,English,,"Have You Or Someone You Know Ever Been Bullied? If “YES”, School and My Bully Experience, A New Anti-Bullying Book, is the perfect read for anyone in need of guidance. “School and My Bully Experience”, a new book about combating bullying by author Frank Joseph Minichetti, blends delightful stories with helpful tips for middle schoolers and young adults who may feel like they are alone or afraid and are in need of help. Join Joseph Minnow as he travels back in time to the year 1965, to his early years in school and his various encounters with bullies. Most of Joseph’s memories are happy ones; however, bullies have inflicted their damage and left some rather bad memories, too. Thirteen-year old Joseph is good-natured, extremely timid and very trusting of everyone. Given these personality traits, Joseph soon discovers he is the perfect target for bullies, like the mean-spirited Butch Barotti, his first bully encounter. Joseph feels like he has a sign on his back, “Please Bully Me.” However, being bullied is not Joseph’s only concern, he also has to deal with his 8th grade teacher, the dreaded Sister Superior, who rules her class with an iron first. Despite her diminutive stature (four foot, five inches tall), Sister is terrifying. Wearing a black habit, her eyes are dark black, like the eyes you see on some stuffed animals, and her voice is a high-pitched shrill comparable to the mythological monster “the Banshee.” The students called her “TNT.” (For the unfamiliar, TNT is a highly explosive substance). School and My Bully Experience contain stories detailing the numerous antics of Sister Superior and other teachers that have a major impact on Joseph and his classmates. After graduating from 8th grade, Joseph encounters new challenges in high school. In fact, the young man must deal with a whole new wave of bullies. He is presented with the opportunity to face his fears and overcome his shy and timid personality by standing up to and fighting his nemesis, the bully Xavier Steele (alias, Xman). This is Joseph’s first fight, which has a surprise ending that leaves his friends and classmates shaking their heads in disbelief. He experiences other firsts as well, his first dance, first class trip, first job, first boy/girl party, and more importantly to a young boy his first girlfriend and first kiss. Unfortunately, Joseph realizes that bullies will inevitably have a negative impact on most of his firsts. School and My Bully Experience tells the story of Joseph Minnow as he goes through adolescence into young adulthood. Eventually, the story morphs into the present time when Joseph becomes a father and works as a substitute teacher. As an adult, Joseph realizes that bullying has reached epidemic proportions and discovers that his daughter Emma has also become a victim. Moreover, he is dismayed when he witnesses the latest form of bullying –“Cyberbullying.” Now anyone can become a bully. The Internet can empower people and encourage cruel, thoughtless behavior, like the “Cyber Girls”, a group of teens that ban together to bully others.Although bullying is a serious subject, School and My Bully Experience contains funny and moving stories, while highlighting the quirky characteristics and unique personalities of people who played pivotal roles in Joseph’s journey. Finally, School and My Bully Experience addresses such topics as “Why People Bully” and “What To Do If You Become a Victim.” It is this combination that young readers will find both entertaining and informative, which makes School and My Bully Experience unique amongst books written on this subject.“School and My Bully Experience” is a chapter book written for ages 9-13, and for the young at heart who want to help themselves or someone they know rise above the personal struggle of being bullied.",,,,December 19th 2019,[],Paperback,[],,9781733873406,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582506118l/51628713._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],97.0,1.0,,51628713-school-and-my-bully-experience,,,,,100.0,2.0,235,,MinkDukane Publishing,[],,,[],,

Frank McCourt,'Tis,,English,,"The sequel to Frank McCourt's memoir of his Irish Catholic boyhood, Angela's Ashes, picks up the story in October 1949, upon his arrival in America. Though he was born in New York, the family had returned to Ireland due to poor prospects in the United States. Now back on American soil, this awkward 19-year-old, with his ""pimply face, sore eyes, and bad teeth,"" has little in common with the healthy, self-assured college students he sees on the subway and dreams of joining in the classroom. Initially, his American experience is as harrowing as his impoverished youth in Ireland, including two of the grimmest Christmases ever described in literature. McCourt views the U.S. through the same sharp eye and with the same dark humor that distinguished his first memoir: race prejudice, casual cruelty, and dead-end jobs weigh on his spirits as he searches for a way out. A glimpse of hope comes from the army, where he acquires some white-collar skills, and from New York University, which admits him without a high school diploma. But the journey toward his position teaching creative writing at Stuyvesant High School is neither quick nor easy. Fortunately, McCourt's openness to every variety of human emotion and longing remains exceptional; even the most damaged, difficult people he encounters are richly rendered individuals with whom the reader can't help but feel uncomfortable kinship. The magical prose, with its singing Irish cadences, brings grandeur and beauty to the most sorrowful events, including the final scene, set in a Limerick graveyard. --Wendy Smith",Frank McCourt #2,,,1999,['Frank McCourt'],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Ireland', 'Biography Memoir', 'Irish Literature', 'History', 'Historical', 'New York']",,9780006551812,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375947803l/4912.jpg,3.7,"['Audie Award for Nonfiction, Unabridged (2000)', 'New York City Book Award for Memoir (1999)']",1320.0,24.0,,4912._Tis,,,,,91.0,55146.0,495,,Flamingo,"['11732', '20791', '17740', '4088', '795']",,,[],,
Frank McCourt,Angela's Ashes,,English,,"Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.

Frank McCourt,Teacher Man,,English,,"McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer.Nearly a decade ago Frank McCourt became an unlikely star when, at the age of sixty-six, he burst onto the literary scene with Angela's Ashes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his childhood in Limerick, Ireland. Then came 'Tis, his glorious account of his early years in New York.Now, here at last, is McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer. Teacher Man is also an urgent tribute to teachers everywhere. In bold and spirited prose featuring his irreverent wit and heartbreaking honesty, McCourt records the trials, triumphs and surprises he faces in public high schools around New York City. His methods anything but conventional, McCourt creates a lasting impact on his students through imaginative assignments (he instructs one class to write ""An Excuse Note from Adam or Eve to God""), singalongs (featuring recipe ingredients as lyrics), and field trips (imagine taking twenty-nine rowdy girls to a movie in Times Square!).McCourt struggles to find his way in the classroom and spends his evenings drinking with writers and dreaming of one day putting his own story to paper. Teacher Man shows McCourt developing his unparalleled ability to tell a great story as, five days a week, five periods per day, he works to gain the attention and respect of unruly, hormonally charged or indifferent adolescents. McCourt's rocky marriage, his failed attempt to get a Ph.D. at Trinity College, Dublin, and his repeated firings due to his propensity to talk back to his superiors ironically lead him to New York's most prestigious school, Stuyvesant High School, where he finally finds a place and a voice. ""Doggedness,"" he says, is ""not as glamorous as ambition or talent or intellect or charm, but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights.""For McCourt, storytelling itself is the source of salvation, and in Teacher Man the journey to redemption -- and literary fame -- is an exhilarating adventure.",Frank McCourt #3,,10/28/05,September 19th 2006,['Frank McCourt'],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Education', 'Autobiography', 'Teaching', 'Biography Memoir', 'Irish Literature', 'Ireland', 'Audiobook']",,9780743243780,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441149612l/4909._SY475_.jpg,3.75,['Audie Award for Biography/Memoir (2007)'],479.0,6.0,,4909.Teacher_Man,,,,,91.0,31326.0,272,,Scribner,"['7605', '11744', '9183', '2250', '544']",,,['United States of America'],,

Frank Muir,A Kentish Lad: The Autobiography of Frank Muir,,English,,"For more than twenty-five years Frank Muir, in partnership with Denis Norden, produced some of the most sparkling and original comedy ever written for radio and television. On programmes such as My Word! and My Music his distinctive voice became familiar to millions as he displayed an astonishingly well-stocked mind and a genius for ad libbing and outrageous puns. Later, working at the BBC and then at London Weekend Television, he produced some of the best television comedy of the 1960s and 70s. He has written highly successful books for children, and two bestselling anthologies of humour.Frank Muir recalls, in glorious detail, a happy 1920s childhood in the seaside town of Ramsgate, where he was born in his grandmother's pub in Broadstairs, and in London, where he attended an inexpensive but excellent school of a kind no longer to be found. He remembers his very first joke at the age of six, when he knew that his destiny was to make people laugh. He also knew from an early age that he wanted to write, but it took a childhood illness for him to discover that humour and writing could be combined. The death of his father forced him to leave school at the age of fourteen and work in a factory making carbon paper. Then, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the RAF as an air photographer and his memories of the war years, as might be imagined, are engagingly different from the usual kind. It was during those years, with their rich fund of comic material, that he began his career as scriptwriter and performer. At his demob in 1945 he moved naturally to London and the Windmill Theatre, that remarkable breeding ground of talent where new comedians like Jimmy Edwards and Alfred Marks vied with nude girls for the attention of the audience. In story after story he recalls the lost world of London in the 1940s and early 50s, when the laughter and creative ideas seemed to explode out of post-war shabbiness and austerity.

"Frank Norris, Kevin Starr (Introduction)",The Octopus: A Story of California,,English,,"Like the tentacles of an octopus, the tracks of the railroad reached out across California, as if to grasp everything of value in the state Based on an actual, bloody dispute between wheat farmers and the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1880, The Octopus is a stunning novel of the waning days of the frontier West. To the tough-minded and self-reliant farmers, the monopolistic, land-grabbing railroad represented everything they despised: consolidation, organization, conformity. But Norris idealizes no one in this epic depiction of the volatile situation, for the farmers themselves ruthlessly exploited the land, and in their hunger for larger holdings they resorted to the same tactics used by the railroad: subversion, coercion and outright violence.

We proved to be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of abuse -- always holding on to our faith in God.Doctor Ajidan Edejem, after finding out that his world was going to die, embarks in the dangerous mission to rescue as many people as possible and search for a new world. All the while, the government wants to keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about the unavoidable doom.""We discovered that the seismic activity is increasing and becoming more frequent causing volcanic eruptions, which increase the volume of sulfates in the atmosphere and break down Ozone. In other words, the atmosphere of this planet is bleeding into space. At the rate these phenomena are taking place, life on Taerr will no longer be supported in less than a month's time. The only way for our species to survive is to travel to another habitable planet. In our research, we have found a planet close to ours with a similar atmosphere about three months away. We have prepared a fleet of ships to take as many citizens as possible to this new planet.

By the age of 23, he had directed two multi-part religious documentaries and had helped instigate the marriage between the American evangelical community and the anti-abortion movement. But as he spoke before thousands in arenas around America, published his own evangelical bestseller, and worked with such figures as Pat Robertson, Jack Kemp, Jerry Falwell, and Dr. James Dobson, Schaeffer felt alienated, precipitating his own crisis of faith and eventually resulting in his departure. Schaeffer has since become a successful secular author. He was reduced to stealing pork chops from the grocery store in LA, rather than take on any more high-paying evangelical speaking gigs.

Frank Warren,PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives (PostSecret),,,,"New York Times BestsellerThe project that captured a nation's imagination.The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary.You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously.The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,"" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional.As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties -- our common humanity.Every day dozens of postcards still make their way to Frank, with postmarks from around the world, touching on every aspect of human experience.

Frank Wilczek,A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design,,English,,"Does the universe embody beautiful ideas?Artists as well as scientists throughout human history have pondered this “beautiful question.” With Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek as your guide, embark on a voyage of related discoveries, from Plato and Pythagoras up to the present. Wilczek’s groundbreaking work in quantum physics was inspired by his intuition to look for a deeper order of beauty in nature. In fact, every major advance in his career came from this intuition: to assume that the universe embodies beautiful forms, forms whose hallmarks are symmetry—harmony, balance, proportion—and economy. There are other meanings of “beauty,” but this is the deep logic of the universe—and it is no accident that it is also at the heart of what we find aesthetically pleasing and inspiring.Wilczek is hardly alone among great scientists in charting his course using beauty as his compass. As he reveals in A Beautiful Question, this has been the heart of scientific pursuit from Pythagoras, the ancient Greek who was the first to argue that “all things are number,” to Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and into the deep waters of twentiethcentury physics. Though the ancients weren’t right about everything, their ardent belief in the music of the spheres has proved true down to the quantum level. Indeed, Wilczek explores just how intertwined our ideas about beauty and art are with our scientific understanding of the cosmos.Wilczek brings us right to the edge of knowledge today, where the core insights of even the craziest quantum ideas apply principles we all understand. The equations for atoms and light are almost literally the same equations that govern musical instruments and sound; the subatomic particles that are responsible for most of our mass are determined by simple geometric symmetries. The universe itself, suggests Wilczek, seems to want to embody beautiful and elegant forms. Perhaps this force is the pure elegance of numbers, perhaps the work of a higher being, or somewhere between. Either way, we don’t depart from the infinite and infinitesimal after all; we’re profoundly connected to them, and we connect them. When we find that our sense of beauty is realized in the physical world, we are discovering something about the world, but also something about ourselves.Gorgeously illustrated, A Beautiful Question is a mind-shifting book that braids the age-old quest for beauty and the age-old quest for truth into a thrilling synthesis. It is a dazzling and important work from one of our best thinkers, whose humor and infectious sense of wonder animate every page. Yes: The world is a work of art, and its deepest truths are ones we already feel, as if they were somehow written in our souls.",,,,July 14th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Nature', 'Mathematics', 'Art', 'Popular Science', 'Audiobook']",,9781594205262,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421713961l/23453106.jpg,3.89,[],86.0,1.0,,23453106-a-beautiful-question,,,,,92.0,1008.0,448,,Penguin Press,"['300', '394', '234', '59', '21']",,,[],,

Highlighting the nuances (no, this isn’t swinging), the relationship options (do you suit a V, an N, an open network?), the myths (don’t count on wild orgies and endless sex—but don’t rule them out, either!) and the expectations (communication, transparency and trust are paramount), the authors share not only their hard-won philosophies about polyamory, but also their hurts and embarrassments. More Than Two is entirely without judgment and peppered with a good dose of humor. Franklin and Eve underscore the importance of engaging in ethical polyamory, while gently guiding readers through the thorny issues of jealousy and insecurity. And no, they’re not trying to convert you: they know that polyamory isn’t for everyone. Franklin and Eve simply provide those who might be embarking on this lifestyle, or those who have already begun, with a toolkit to help them make informed decisions and set them on a path to enjoying multiple happy, strong, enriching relationships.

Frans de Waal,The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society,,English,,"""An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness.""—Desmond Morris, author of The Naked ApeAre we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests? In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals–and humans–are ""preprogrammed to reach out."" He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer ""reassuring rumbles"" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance, and which seems to be evidenced by the current greed-driven stock market collapse. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective–one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what may well become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times.",,,01/01/09,September 22nd 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Animals', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Nature', 'Biology', 'Evolution']",,9780307407764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320549477l/6525532.jpg,3.98,[],98.0,1.0,,6525532-the-age-of-empathy,,,,,94.0,1938.0,304,,Crown,"['635', '764', '420', '102', '17']",,,[],,
Frans de Waal,Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?,,English,,"What separates your mind from an animal’s? Maybe you think it’s your ability to design tools, your sense of self, or your grasp of past and future—all traits that have helped us define ourselves as the planet’s preeminent species. But in recent decades, these claims have eroded, or even been disproven outright, by a revolution in the study of animal cognition. Take the way octopuses use coconut shells as tools; elephants that classify humans by age, gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash memory puts that of humans to shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps, bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth of animal intelligence. He offers a firsthand account of how science has stood traditional behaviorism on its head by revealing how smart animals really are, and how we’ve underestimated their abilities for too long.People often assume a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own intelligence at the top. But what if it is more like a bush, with cognition taking different forms that are often incomparable to ours? Would you presume yourself dumber than a squirrel because you’re less adept at recalling the locations of hundreds of buried acorns? Or would you judge your perception of your surroundings as more sophisticated than that of a echolocating bat? De Waal reviews the rise and fall of the mechanistic view of animals and opens our minds to the idea that animal minds are far more intricate and complex than we have assumed.

Our closest relatives--the other mentally complex and socially skilled primates--offer tantalizing clues. In Tree of Origin nine of the world's top primate experts read these clues and compose the most extensive picture to date of what the behavior of monkeys and apes can tell us about our own evolution as a species.It has been nearly fifteen years since a single volume addressed the issue of human evolution from a primate perspective, and in that time we have witnessed explosive growth in research on the subject. Tree of Origin gives us the latest news about bonobos, the ""make love not war"" apes who behave so dramatically unlike chimpanzees. We learn about the tool traditions and social customs that set each ape community apart. We see how DNA analysis is revolutionizing our understanding of paternity, intergroup migration, and reproductive success. And we confront intriguing discoveries about primate hunting behavior, politics, cognition, diet, and the evolution of language and intelligence that challenge claims of human uniqueness in new and subtle ways.Tree of Origin provides the clearest glimpse yet of the apelike ancestor who left the forest and began the long journey toward modern humanity.",,,10/30/01,October 1st 2002,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Psychology', 'Animals', 'Anthropology']",,9780674010048,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347230092l/769507.jpg,4.13,[],100.0,1.0,,769507.Tree_of_Origin,,,,,96.0,89.0,320,,Harvard University Press,"['35', '36', '14', '3', '1']",,,[],,
"Frans de Waal, Frans Lanting (Photographer)",Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape,,English,,"This remarkable primate with the curious name is challenging established views on human evolution. The bonobo, least known of the great apes, is a female-centered, egalitarian species that has been dubbed the ""make-love-not-war"" primate by specialists. In bonobo society, females form alliances to intimidate males, sexual behavior (in virtually every partner combination) replaces aggression and serves many social functions, and unrelated groups mingle instead of fighting. The species's most striking achievement is not tool use or warfare but sensitivity to others.In the first book to combine and compare data from captivity and the field, Frans de Waal, a world-renowned primatologist, and Frans Lanting, an internationally acclaimed wildlife photographer, present the most up-to-date perspective available on the bonobo. Focusing on social organization, de Waal compares the bonobo with its better-known relative, the chimpanzee. The bonobo's relatively nonviolent behavior and the tendency for females to dominate males confront the evolutionary models derived from observing the chimpanzee's male power politics, cooperative hunting, and intergroup warfare. Further, the bonobo's frequent, imaginative sexual contacts, along with its low reproduction rate, belie any notion that the sole natural purpose of sex is procreation. Humans share over 98 percent of their genetic material with the bonobo and the chimpanzee. Is it possible that the peaceable bonobo has retained traits of our common ancestor that we find hard to recognize in ourselves?Eight superb full-color photo essays offer a rare view of the bonobo in its native habitat in the rain forests of Zaire as well as in zoos and research facilities. Additional photographs and highlighted interviews with leading bonobo experts complement the text. This book points the way to viable alternatives to male-based models of human evolution and will add considerably to debates on the origin of our species. Anyone interested in primates, gender issues, evolutionary psychology, and exceptional wildlife photography will find a fascinating companion in Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape.",,,04/23/97,October 27th 1998,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Animals', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Nature', 'Anthropology', 'Biology', 'Africa', 'Photography', 'Science Nature']",,9780520216518,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328244282l/880684.jpg,4.31,[],70.0,1.0,,880684.Bonobo,,,,,98.0,458.0,200,,University of California Press,"['234', '145', '68', '8', '3']",,,[],,
"Frans de Waal, Rasa Dirgėlė (Translator)",Paskutinis mamos apkabinimas,,Lithuanian,,"Gyvūnų emocijas perprasti sunku, todėl mokslininkai ilgą laiką ir į jų išraiškas žiūrėjo skeptiškai. Buvo įprasta teigti, esą gyvūnai turi tik instinktus. Olandų etologas ir zoologas Fransas de Waalas (gim. 1948), keturis dešimtmečius tyrinėjęs gyvūnų elgesį, atskleidžia, kad visoms primatų rūšims būdingos panašios emocijos, – ir žmogus čia niekuo ne išskirtinis.Knyga pradedama nuo matriarchės šimpanzės vardu Mama istorijos. Jaudinančiame epizode aprašoma, kaip pas sergančią Mamą atsisveikinti ateina 40 metų ją pažinojęs mokslininkas.

Bearing singular insight into the rage and frustration of colonized peoples, and the role of violence in effecting historical change, the book incisively attacks the twin perils of post-independence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the elites on the one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other.Fanon's analysis, a veritable handbook of social reorganization for leaders of emerging nations, has been reflected all too clearly in the corruption and violence that has plagued present-day Africa.

His escape from Germany during the final desperate days of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of his spiritual mission culminating with his classic books on Hermetic magic.More than an occult novel, Frabato the Magician is itself a work of magic which illuminates Bardon's other books as well as providing a revealing look into the dark occult forces which lay behind the rise of the Third Reich.

These “aphorisms” appeared, sometimes with a few words changed, in other writings–some of them as posthumous fragments published only after Kafka’s death in 1924. While working onK., his major book on Kafka, in the Bodleian Library, Roberto Calasso realized that the Zürau aphorisms, each written on a separate slip of very thin paper, numbered but unbound, represented something unique in Kafka’s opus–a work whose form he had created simultaneously with its content.

"Franz Kafka, Hans Blomqvist (Översättare), Erik Ågren (Översättare)",Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen: brev juli-december 1920,,Swedish,,"En ny volym i sviten Franz Kafkas samlade skrifter. Denna volym har fått titeln Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen och innehåller brev som Kafka skrev under perioden juli till december 1920. För översättning och kommentarer står Hans Blomqvist och Erik Ågren.När volymen börjar har Kafka just återvänt till Prag efter sitt omvälvande kärleksmöte med Milena Jesenská i Wien. Under fyra dagar har de äntligen - efter flera månader av allt intimare korrespondens - fått rå om varandra helt och hållet, fyra för Kafka ofattbart lyckliga dagar. Han är djupt förälskad (""jag är fullständigt uppslukad av dig"") och nu kan han inte få nog av att skriva brev efter brev till Milena, inte få nog av att i detalj fästa på papper vad han tänker och känner. Det blir minst ett långt brev per dag, ofta två, ibland tre.Det första han gör vid återkomsten till Prag är att ta itu med vad han kallar ""ett bödelsgöra"". Han söker upp Julie Wohryzek som sedan ett halvår tillbaka är hans fästmö och bryter förlovningen med henne. Det känns hårt, det känns brutalt, men det är nödvändigt, och det är nödvändigt att det sker omedelbart. Tanken är att Milena lika resolut ska kräva skilsmässa från sin man, Ernst Pollak. Men så verkar det inte bli...Kafkas brev till Milena Jesenská är något av det mest gripande man kan läsa. Denne store välformulerade författare stiger - förlöst av den kärlek han känner ? in i det innersta av sitt eget känsloliv och uttrycker, rakt på sak och med blixtrande skärpa, vad han i ögonblicket upplever. Kärleken till Milena har fått hela Franz Kafkas numera så omtalat mörka världsbild att plötsligt ljusna riktigt ordentligt. ""Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen.""Kafka kämpar sedan 1917 med tuberkulos och vistas i omgångar på sanatorier. Men just nu, under sommaren 1920, är det precis som om tuberkulosen har upphört eller tagit en paus. Enligt Milena är det som om han inte lider av mer än ""en lättare förkylning"".Samtidigt står det klart att den kärlek han känner till Milena inte har mildrat hans hårda syn på sig själv. Hans självhat finns kvar. ""Smutsig är jag Milena, otroligt smutsig, därför tjatar jag så mycket om renhet. Inga sjunger så rent som de som befinner sig längst ner i helvetet, det vi tror är änglars sång är i själva verket deras sång.""Hans Blomqvist och Erik Ågren har tilldelats Stiftelsen Natur och Kulturs översättarpris och Samfundet De Nios översättarpris för sitt arbete med Franz Kafkas samlade skrifter.

"Franz Kafka, Jason Baker (Introduction and Notes), Donna Freed (Translation)",The Metamorphosis and Other Stories,,English,,"The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, by Franz Kafka, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.Virtually unknown during his lifetime, Franz Kafka is now one of the world’s most widely read and discussed authors. His nightmarish novels and short stories have come to symbolize modern man’s anxiety and alienation in a bizarre, hostile, and dehumanized world. This vision is most fully realized in Kafka’s masterpiece, “The Metamorphosis,” a story that is both harrowing and amusing, and a landmark of modern literature. Bringing together some of Kafka’s finest work, this collection demonstrates the richness and variety of the author’s artistry. “The Judgment,” which Kafka considered to be his decisive breakthrough, and “The Stoker,” which became the first chapter of his novel Amerika, are here included. These two, along with “The Metamorphosis,” form a suite of stories Kafka referred to as “The Sons,” and they collectively present a devastating portrait of the modern family.Also included are “In the Penal Colony,” a story of a torture machine and its operators and victims, and “A Hunger Artist,” about the absurdity of an artist trying to communicate with a misunderstanding public.

"François Truffaut, Alfred Hitchcock",Hitchcock,,English,,"Any book-length interview with Alfred Hitchcock is valuable, but considering that this volume's interlocutor is François Truffaut, the conversation is remarkable indeed. Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like Rear Window (""I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged""), his technical insight into Psycho's shower scene (""the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]""), and his ruminations on flops such as Under Capricorn (""If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'"").

Drawing on eighteenth-century English romanticists, on explorers in America, and on Goethe's Werther, he had a profound effect on French writers from Victor Hugo and Lamartine to George Sand and Flaubert. A quixotic and paradoxical personality, he combined impressive careers as a brilliant prose-poet, a spiritual guide, a high-ranking diplomat, and an enterprising lover.Atala and René are his two best-known works, reflecting not only his own joys, aspirations, and despair, but the emerging tastes of a new literary era. Atala is the passionate and tragic love story of a young Indian couple wandering in the wilderness, enthralled by the beauties of nature, drawn to a revivified Christianity by its esthetic charm and consoling beneficence, and finally succumbing to the cruelty of fate. Perhaps even more than Werther or Childe Harold, René embodies the romantic hero, and is not wholly foreign to the disorientation of youth today. Solitary, mysterious, ardent, and poetic, he is in open revolt against a society whose values he rejects.

Fred Chappell,I Am One of You Forever,,English,,"Wonderfully funny and also deeply touching, I Am One of You Forever is the story of a young boy's coming of age. Set in the hills and hollows of western North Carolina in the years around World War II, it tells of ten-year-old Jess and his family -- father, mother, grandmother, foster brother, and an odd assortment of other relatives -- who usher Jess into the adult world, with all its attendant joys and sorrows, knowledge and mystery.Jess's father is feisty, restless, and fun-loving. His mother is straitlaced and serious but accepts with grace and good humor the antics of the men of the family, a trait she learned from her own mother. Johnson Gibbs is the orphaned teenager who comes to live with them on their mountain farm. Life on the laurel-covered mountain is isolated and at times difficult, but for Jess it is made rich and remarkable through his relationship with his father and, especially, Johnson Gibbs.Visiting the farm from time to time is a gallery of eccentric relatives who are surely among the most memorable creations in recent fiction. Uncle Luden is a womanizer who left the mountains years ago for a job in California that ""paid actual cash money."" Uncle Gurton has a spooky way of appearing and disappearing without ever seeming to enter or exit, but it is his flowing beard, which he has apparently never trimmed and which he keeps tucked inside his overalls, that is of most fascination to Jess.Uncle Zeno is a storyteller. With the words ""That puts me in mind of..."" everyone around knows that he is about to launch into another of his endless tales. Uncle Runkin, who always brings his handmade coffin to sleep in whenever he visits, spends his time carving intricate designs into the coffin and trying to find just the right epitaph for his tombstone. Aunt Samantha Barefoot stops by for a brief spell, too. A country singer and cousin to Jess's grandmother, she is a woman of uncensored speech (Jess learns a lot from her) and honest emotions. Chappell tells the story of all of these characters in a series of chapters that range from fantasy and near farce to pathos. As notable for its lyrical descriptions of the rural settings as for its finely honed vernacular dialogue, I Am One of You Forever shows us a world full of wit and wisdom and the sadness at the heart of things. As one would expect from a poet like Fred Chappell, every line offers its own pleasures and satisfactions.",,,10/29/85,July 1st 1987,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Southern', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Coming Of Age', 'Family']",,9780807114100,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348110649l/104898.jpg,4.1,[],250.0,3.0,,104898.I_Am_One_of_You_Forever,,,,,93.0,1286.0,184,,Louisiana State University Press,"['555', '433', '205', '61', '32']",,,[],,
Fred D'Aguiar,The Longest Memory,,English,,"From William Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner to Toni Morrison's Beloved, modern American fiction engaged with slavery has provoked fiery controversy. So will The Longest Memory, the powerful, beautifully crafted, internationally acclaimed fictional debut of prizewinning Guyanese poet Fred D'Aguiar. In language extraordinary for its tautness and resonance, The Longest Memory tells the story of a rebellious, fiercely intelligent young slave, who in 1810 attempts to flee a Virginia plantation - and of his father who inadvertently betrays him. The young slave's love for a white girl who slakes his forbidden thirst for learning and his painful relationship with his father are hauntingly evoked in this novel of astonishing lyrical simplicity. It is a measure of D'Aguiar's achievement and bravery that The Longest Memory is informed not only by the complicities between black slave and white master but also by the tensions among slaves themselves - between stoic survivalists and passionate rebels. Remarkable for its keenness of observation, subtlety, and restraint, The Longest Memory heralds the arrival of a major new voice in the contemporary literature of the African diaspora.",,,10/01/94,July 6th 1995,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Historical', 'Read For School', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adult', 'British Literature']",,9780099462217,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356453647l/969310.jpg,3.83,"['Whitbread Award for First Novel (1994)', 'David Higham Prize for Fiction (1994)']",97.0,1.0,,969310.The_Longest_Memory,,,,,93.0,1012.0,144,,Vintage,"['262', '402', '274', '57', '17']",,,[],,

Fred Penzel,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Complete Guide to Getting Well and Staying Well,,English,,"Morbid obsessions with sex, germs, or with one's appearance, and uncontrollable compulsions to hoard objects, to check and recheck locks, or to pull one's hair are just a few of the symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, which afflict over ten million Americans. Many suffer in isolation, not knowing that their disorder has a name, how to seek help, or how to help themselves.

He takes the reader through each step of the most effective behavioral therapies, detailing how progress is made and how to avoid relapse. He also offers a completely up-to-date discussion of medication--how it is used as part of the overall treatment, its effect on pregnancy, how to choose the best medicine, and how to know if it is working. In addition, Dr. Penzel discusses the treatment of children with these disorders, offers helpful advice for the families of sufferers, and lists sources of help and information (including the latest sites on the Internet).",,,,October 19th 2000,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Psychology', 'Self Help']",,9780195140927,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347444886l/110863.jpg,4.08,[],94.0,1.0,,110863.Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorders,,,,,97.0,36.0,448,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['13', '14', '8', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Fred Turner,From Counterculture to Cyberculture,"Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism",,Social Science,"In the early 1960s, computers haunted the American popular imagination. Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. From Counterculture to Cyberculture is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning Whole Earth Catalog, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful Wired magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think.",,,,2006.0,,,,0226817415,9780226817415,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wz5EmQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.96,,,,,,,,,,,,327.0,,,,323.0,,,,

They know nothing about the attack: the what, where or when. They have no sources in Al Qaeda, and it's impossible to plant someone. Impossible, unless . . . 
  
The Afghan is Izmat Khan, a five-year prisoner of Guantanamo Bay and a former senior commander of the Taliban. The Afghan is also Colonel Mike Martin, a 25-year veteran of war zones around the world, a dark, lean man born and raised in Iraq. In an attempt to stave off disaster, the intelligence agencies will try to do what no one has ever done before - pass off a Westerner as an Arab among Arabs - pass off Martin as the trusted Khan.
  
It will require extraordinary preparation, and then extraordinary luck, for nothing can truly prepare Martin for the dark and shifting world he is about to enter. Or for the terrible things he will find there . . .

Frederick Lenz,Insights,Talks on the Nature of Existence,,Spiritual life,"In 1983, when Rama - Dr. Frederick P. Lenz recorded a series of profound and powerful talks entitled Insights: Talks on the Nature of Existence. This book is a transcript of those talks. Rama was instructing an ever-growing number of students. Dr. Lenz himself was developing an approach to self-realization that, while emphasizing meditation and enlightenment, drew from a variety of traditions including Vedanta, Tibetan Buddhism and the American mystic teachings described by Carlos Castaneda. The Insights talks, which evolved from this time period, are like a crest jewel of Dr. Lenz's body of teachings. It is interesting to note that most of the Insights talks are subtitled ""Modular Mysticism"" (for example, ""Modular Mysticism: The Truth""). Even the talk titled ""How to Make Friends with God"" - discussed in depth only in this series - is termed a part of ""Modular Mysticism."" In the practice of mysticism, Dr. Lenz explains, the student begins to understand awareness and power. Modular mysticism becomes the science of power, and the student learns to gain power, to stop losing power, to store power, and eventually to give power to others. In order to gain power, the student begins to lead an efficient and well-structured life. As the student accomplishes this, they are able to move more easily through the doorways to enlightenment. At each step along the journey of the Insights talks, Dr. Lenz gives specific examples of how to adapt and integrate mystical Buddhist practice into a Western lifestyle. For Dr. Lenz there was no contradiction between being a successful Westerner and a successful Buddhist, be it building a career, working out at the health club, going to the movies, shopping for clothes -- or understanding why more women don't attain enlightenment (when, in fact, it's easier for them to do so). In every instance, Dr. Lenz connects the heights of the mystical experiences directly to our everyday lives.",,,,2003.0,,,,1932206086,9781932206081,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NOX2PgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,304.0,,,,1.0,,,,

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper ""No Silver Bullet""; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, ""There will be no silver bullet within ten years.""",,Anniversary Edition,1975,August 2nd 1995,[],Paperback,"['Programming', 'Nonfiction', 'Computer Science', 'Technology', 'Business', 'Management', 'Software', 'Technical', 'Computers', 'Engineering']",,9780201835953,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348430512l/13629.jpg,4.04,[],34.0,1.0,,13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month,,,,,94.0,11313.0,322,,Addison-Wesley Professional,"['4043', '4489', '2126', '543', '112']",,,[],,
Frederick Reiken,Day for Night,,English,,"As a child, Beverly Rabinowitz fled Europe with her mother during World War II. Almost half a century later, while vacationing in Florida with her boyfriend and his son, a chance encounter leads to a strangely lucid moment in which she senses that her father, long believed to have been killed during the war, is close by. It’s the first of many seemingly random events that are guiding Beverly, and the people in her life, toward a startling discovery.Over the course of Frederick Reiken’s provocative, intricate novel, Beverly will learn that her story is part of something larger, and brilliantly surprising. Because her story is not hers alone, but also that of a comatose teenage boy in Utah, an elusive sixties-era fugitive, an FBI agent pursuing a twenty-year obsession, a Massachusetts veterinarian who falls in love on a kibbutz in Israel, and a host of other characters. Day For Night illuminates how disparate, far-flung people can be connected, and how the truth of those bonds can upend entire lives. Each chapter is a small universe of its own, and together they form a dazzling whole. Gliding effortlessly across time and space, in settings that range from Florida to New Jersey to the Caribbean and the Dead Sea, Day For Night builds toward moments of revelation, when refugees from their own lives, or from history’s cruelties, come together in unpredictable and extraordinary ways.",,,10/30/10,April 26th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery', 'Israel', 'Jewish', 'Literature', 'Family', 'American', 'Historical']",,9780316077569,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1263074469l/7530820.jpg,3.68,['Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (2010)'],99.0,1.0,,7530820-day-for-night,,,,,88.0,823.0,326,,Reagan Arthur Books,"['180', '325', '216', '79', '23']",,,['Florida (United States)'],,

The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world.Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue.

But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town.

Dyson evocatively conveys the thrill of a deep engagement with the world-be it as scientist, citizen, student, or parent. Detailing a unique career not limited to his groundbreaking work in physics, Dyson discusses his interest in minimizing loss of life in war, in disarmament, and even in thought experiments on the expansion of our frontiers into the galaxies.",,,11/29/79,April 15th 1981,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Physics', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Astronomy', 'Biography Memoir', 'History Of Science']",,9780465016778,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387755237l/134225.jpg,4.2,['National Book Award Finalist for Science (Hardcover) (1980) & (Paperback) (1982)'],97.0,1.0,,134225.Disturbing_the_Universe,,,,,97.0,784.0,304,,Basic Books,"['331', '307', '125', '14', '7']",,,[],,
"Freidoune Sahebjam, Richard Seaver",The Stoning of Soraya M.,,English,,"Soraya M.'s husband, Ghorban-Ali, couldn't afford to marry another woman. Rather than returning Soraya's dowry, as custom required before taking a second wife, he plotted with four friends and a counterfeit mullah to dispose of her. Together, they accused Soraya of adultery. Her only crime was cooking for a friend's widowed husband. Exhausted by a lifetime of abuse and hardship, Soraya said nothing, and the makeshift tribunal took her silence as a confession of guilt. They sentenced her to death by stoning: a punishment prohibited by Islam but widely practiced. Day by day sometimes minute by minute Sahebjam deftly recounts these horrendous events, tracing Soraya's life with searing immediacy, from her arranged marriage and the births of her nine children to her husband's increasing cruelty and her horrifying execution, where, by tradition, her father, husband, and sons hurled the first stones.  This is one woman's story, but it stands for the stories of thousands of women who suffered and continue to suffer the same fate.

"Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes (Introduction), Sarah M. Lowe (Introduction)",The Diary of Frida Kahlo: An Intimate Self-Portrait,,English,,"Published here in its entirety, Frida Kahlo's amazing illustrated journal documents the last ten years of her turbulent life. This passionate, often surprising, intimate record, kept under lock and key for some forty years in Mexico, reveals many new dimensions in the complex persona of this remarkable Mexican artist.Covering the years 1944-45, the 170-page journal contains Frida's thoughts, poems, and dreams, and reflects her stormy relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera, Mexico's famous artist. The seventy watercolor illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches, several elegant self-portraits, others complete paintings - offer insights into her creative process, and show her frequently using the journal to work out pictorial ideas for her canvases.The text entries, written in Frida's round, full script in brightly colored inks, add an almost decorative quality, making the journal as captivating to look at as it is to read. Frida's childhood, her political sensibilities, and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in witty phrases and haunting images.Although much has been written recently about this extraordinary woman, Frida Kahlo's art and life continue to fascinate the world. This personal document, published in a complete full-color facsimile edition, will add greatly to the understanding of her unique and powerful vision and her enormous courage in the face of more than thirty-five operations to correct injuries she had sustained in an accident at the age of eighteen. The facsimile is accompanied by an introduction by the world-renowned Mexican man of letters Carlos Fuentes and a complete translation of the diary's text. An essay on the place of the diary in Frida's work and in art history at large, as well as commentaries on the images, is provided by Sarah M.

A summer when his new friend Roland, seemingly descended from the knights of the past, encouraged him to stand up for himself and for those he loves. It was a summer when he and his friends formed the Order of the Red Dragon that gave them a sense of identity and purpose in their turbulent world; a summer when innocent childhood games were torn apart by an almost inevitable tragedy.

Disturbing themes are explored, from bullying to child abuse to rivalry, yet there is always a sense of a child's unbreakable spirit. Published to acclaim in 1992, Benjamin Dove has won several book awards, including the International Board on Books for Young People Award (the IBBY), The Icelandic Children's Book Award, and the Reykjavik City Children's Book Award.

Friedrich A. Hayek,The Road to Serfdom,,English,,"A classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944—when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program—The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, The Road to Serfdom garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, Reader's Digest published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.After thirty-two printings in the United States, The Road to Serfdom has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of The Road to Serfdom on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher ""revolutions"" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.F. A. Hayek (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory and the principal proponent of libertarianism in the twentieth century.On the first American edition of The Road to Serfdom:""One of the most important books of our generation. . . . It restates for our time the issue between liberty and authority with the power and rigor of reasoning with which John Stuart Mill stated the issue for his own generation in his great essay On Liberty. . . . It is an arresting call to all well-intentioned planners and socialists, to all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen.""—Henry Hazlitt, New York Times Book Review, September 1944""In the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often—at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough—that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of.""—George Orwell, Collected Essays",,Fiftieth Anniversary Edition,09/18/44,October 15th 1994,[],Paperback,"['Economics', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Political Science', 'Business', 'Sociology', 'Finance']",,9780226320618,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327787673l/299215.jpg,4.17,[],575.0,7.0,,299215.The_Road_to_Serfdom,,,,,94.0,18721.0,274,,University Of Chicago Press,"['8783', '6035', '2702', '781', '420']",,,[],,

He labels as the ""fatal conceit"" the idea that ""man is able to shape the world around him according to his wishes.""""The achievement of The Fatal Conceit is that it freshly shows why socialism must be refuted rather than merely dismissed—then refutes it again.""—David R.

"Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Renata Colorni (Translator)",La morte della Pizia,,Italian,,"«Stizzita per la scemenza dei suoi stessi oracoli e per l’ingenua credulità dei Greci, la sacerdotessa di Delfi Pannychis XI, lunga e secca come quasi tutte le Pizie che l’avevano preceduta, ascoltò le domande del giovane Edipo, un altro che voleva sapere se i suoi genitori erano davvero i suoi genitori, come se fosse facile stabilire una cosa del genere nei circoli aristocratici, dove, senza scherzi, donne maritate davano a intendere ai loro consorti, i quali peraltro finivano per crederci, come qualmente Zeus in persona si fosse giaciuto con loro». Con queste parole spigolose e beffarde ha inizio La morte della Pizia e subito il racconto investe alcuni dei più augusti miti greci, senza risparmiarsi irriverenze e furia grottesca.

Friedrich Nietzsche,On the Use and Abuse of History for Life,,English,,"Forward ""Incidentally, I despise everything which merely instructs me without increasing or immediately enlivening my activity."" These are Goethe's words. With them, as with a heartfelt expression of Ceterum censeo [I judge otherwise], our consideration of the worth and the worthlessness of history may begin. For this work is to set down why, in the spirit of Goethe's saying, we must seriously despise instruction without vitality, knowledge which enervates activity, and history as an expensive surplus of knowledge and a luxury, because we lack what is still most essential to us and because what is superfluous is hostile to what is essential. To be sure, we need history. But we need it in a manner different from the way in which the spoilt idler in the garden of knowledge uses it, no matter how elegantly he may look down on our coarse and graceless needs and distresses. That is, we need it for life and action, not for a comfortable turning away from life and action or merely for glossing over the egotistical life and the cowardly bad act. We wish to use history only insofar as it serves living. But there is a degree of doing history and a valuing of it through which life atrophies and degenerates. To bring this phenomenon to light as a remarkable symptom of our time is every bit as necessary as it may be painful. I have tried to describe a feeling which has often enough tormented me. I take my revenge on this feeling when I expose it to the general public. Perhaps with such a description someone or other will have reason to point out to me that he also knows this particular sensation but that I have not felt it with sufficient purity and naturalness and definitely have not expressed myself with the appropriate certainty and mature experience. Perhaps one or two will respond in this way. However, most people will tell me that this feeling is totally wrong, unnatural, abominable, and absolutely forbidden, that with it, in fact, I have shown myself unworthy of the powerful historical tendency of the times, as it has been, by common knowledge, observed for the past two generations, particularly among the Germans. Whatever the reaction, now that I dare to expose myself with this natural description of my feeling, common decency will be fostered rather than shamed, because I am providing many opportunities for a contemporary tendency like the reaction just mentioned to make polite pronouncements. Moreover, I obtain for myself something of even more value to me than respectability: I become publicly instructed and set straight about our times.  This essay is also out of touch with the times because here I am trying for once to see as a contemporary disgrace, infirmity, and defect something of which our age is justifiably proud, its historical culture. For I believe, in fact, that we are all suffering from a consumptive historical fever and at the very least should recognize that we are afflicted with it. If Goethe with good reason said that with our virtues we simultaneously cultivate our faults and if, as everyone knows, a hypertrophic virtue (as the historical sense of our age appears to me to be) can serve to destroy a people just as well as a hypertrophic vice, then people may make allowance for me this once. Also in my defence I should not conceal the fact that the experiences which aroused these feelings of torment in me I have derived for the most part from myself and only from others for the purpose of comparison and that, insofar as I am a student more of ancient times, particularly the Greeks, I come as a child in these present times to such anachronistic experiences concerning myself....",,,04/01/74,May 17th 2008,[],Kindle Edition,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'German Literature', 'Essays', 'Theory', 'School', 'Germany', '19th Century']",,9780915144945,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385450228l/18957343.jpg,3.95,[],94.0,1.0,,18957343-on-the-use-and-abuse-of-history-for-life,,,,,93.0,1775.0,78,,Oak Grove,"['607', '645', '396', '87', '40']",,,[],,
Friedrich Nietzsche,On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,,,,"""On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense"") is an (initially) unpublished work of Friedrich Nietzsche written in 1873, one year after The Birth of Tragedy. It deals largely with epistemological questions of truth and language, including the formation of concepts. Every word immediately becomes a concept, inasmuch as it is not intended to serve as a reminder of the unique and wholly individualized original experience to which it owes its birth, but must at the same time fit innumerable, more or less similar cases—which means, strictly speaking, never equal—in other words, a lot of unequal cases. Every concept originates through our equating what is unequal. According to Paul F. Glenn, Nietzsche is arguing that ""concepts are metaphors which do not correspond to reality."" Although all concepts are human inventions (created by common agreement to facilitate ease of communication), human beings forget this fact after inventing them, and come to believe that they are ""true"" and do correspond to reality. Thus Nietzsche argues that ""truth"" is actually: A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins. These ideas about truth and its relation to human language have been particularly influential among postmodern theorists, and ""On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense"" is one of the works most responsible for Nietzsche's reputation (albeit a contentious one) as ""the godfather of postmodernism.""",,,,1873,[],,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Essays', 'German Literature', 'Theory', 'Germany', '19th Century', 'Psychology', 'Read For School']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357800762l/17229241.jpg,4.26,[],99.0,1.0,,17229241-on-truth-and-lies-in-a-nonmoral-sense,,,,,96.0,1089.0,8,,,"['523', '375', '145', '39', '7']",,,[],,
"Friedrich Nietzsche, Douglas Smith (Translator)",On the Genealogy of Morals,,English,,"On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) is a book about the history of ethics and about interpretation. Nietzsche rewrites the former as a history of cruelty, exposing the central values of the Judaeo-Christian and liberal traditions - compassion, equality, justice - as the product of a brutal process of conditioning designed to domesticate the animal vitality of earlier cultures. The result is a book which raises profoundly disquieting issues about the violence of both ethics and interpretation. Nietzsche questions moral certainties by showing that religion and science have no claim to absolute truth, before turning on his own arguments in order to call their very presuppositions into question. The Genealogy is the most sustained of Nietzsche's later works and offers one of the fullest expressions of his characteristic concerns.

The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H.

The Will to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the most famous books of the past hundred years, but few have studied it. Here, at last, is the first critical edition in any language.Down through the Nazi period The Will to Power was often mistakenly considered to be Nietzsche's crowning systematic labor; since World War II it has frequently been denigrated, just as fallaciously, as being not worth reading. In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche's notebooks, in a topical arrangement that enables the reader to find what Nietzsche wrote on nihilism, art, morality, religion, the theory of knowledge, and whatever else interested him. But no previous edition—even in the original German—shows which notes Nietzsche utilized subsequently in his works, and which sections are not paralleled in the finished books.

Hollingdale, brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche translator and scholar. Professor Kauffman has included the approximate date of each note. His running footnote commentary offers the information needed to follow Nietzsche's train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which notes were eventually superseded by later formulations, and where all German editions, including the very latest, depart from the manuscripts.

"Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Kaufmann (Translator)",The Birth of Tragedy / The Case of Wagner,,English,,"The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche's 1st book. Its youthful faults were exposed by him in the brilliant 'Attempt at a Self-Criticism' which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down thru the Victorian era. It sounded themes developed in the 20th century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts & others. The Case of Wagner (1888) was one his last books & his wittiest. In attitude & style it's diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects & deal with art & culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche's thought. The distinguished new translations by Walter Kaufmann superbly reflect in English Nietzsche's idiom & the vitality of his style.

Frigyes Karinthy,Grimasz,,Hungarian,,"Tóth Árpád: Karinthy Frigyes: GrimaszA magyar újság-croquis egyike a nálunk termett és fejlődött legsajátosabb irodalmi műfajoknak. Első mesterei és későbbi továbbfejlesztői különös munkát végeztek, körülbelül olyat, mint a Vigadó-palota zseniális építője, aki úgy akart magyar stílust teremteni, hogy kelet és nyugat egy-egy jellegzetes építő stílusát, a mórt és a románt keverte. Nem ily öntudatosan, de körülbelül ezzel a módszerrel dolgoztak a magyar szellemesség irodalmi kifejezői is: keletről hozott, kényelmes, vitézkötéses, anekdotás humorunkat franciáktól tanult fogásokkal tették modernebbé, csattanóbbá, finomabbá. Két nevet említek, a Mikszáthét és Heltaiét, a két legkitűnőbb mesterét: az egyik még talán túlságos táblabírós zamatú, a másik már talán túlságosan is francia. De mindkettőben főtulajdonság: a bölcs derű és a finomság, a szatíra náluk inkább csak pikáns árnyalat!A legújabb magyar újság-croquis-k erős fordulatot mutatnak: a bölcs mosolyból kegyetlen grimasz lett. Már Molnár Ferenc croquis-cikkei is ezt a fordulatot éreztetik, de legteljesebben Karinthy Frigyes szokatlan merészségű és erejű ilynemű művei rajzolják elénk az új magyar croquis képét. Molnárnál még némi bujkáló líra enyhíti olykor a maró viccet, Karinthynál teljes fölényével és kegyetlenségével lép elő a szatíra. Croquis-cikkei olvasásakor fantasztikus, már-már félelmes méretekig lendülő cirkuszi bohóc víziója elevenedik elém, egy krétás arcú vigyorgóé, aki pofonokat oszt, fejeket tép le, amiket fordítva, eltorzítva ragaszt vissza, s olykor a csillagokig nyúl, hogy azokkal mutasson be groteszk és döbbenetes tréfákat.Karinthy szokatlan sikerének kétségkívül az a titka, hogy bár kegyetlen s bár igen gyakran a croquis szerény korlátain szinte brutális erővel veti túl magát heves lendülete, mindvégig kacagtató tud maradni. A mulattató helyzetek variálásában, a nevettető torzítás biztosságában elsőrangú, s a croquis-nyelv kezelésében szinte páratlan. A furcsa, alakuló budapesti nyelv bravúros kezelője, s akárhányszor avatott továbbfejlesztője is. Némely fordulata, egy-egy alakjának neve szájról szájra száll, s olyanok szókincsébe is beiktatódik, akik talán nem is olvasták croquis-jait.Karinthy szatirikus cikkei - melyek közül legújabb kötetében, a Grimasz címűben, talán a legjellegzetesebbeket gyűjtötte össze - a maguk módján pompás kifejezői napjaink szellemének, az író kitűnő hivatottságát mi sem mutatja jobban, minthogy ez a kifejezőerő egy jelentéktelenebb műfaj keretében is oly dúsan adatott meg neki.",,,,2011,[],ebook,[],,9789630970037,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447937818l/27859952._SX318_.jpg,3.75,[],96.0,1.0,,27859952-grimasz,,,,,88.0,8.0,,,Kossuth Kiadó,"['2', '3', '2', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Fritz J. Raddatz,Tagebücher 1982-2001,,German,,"Ein Buch wie dieses hat es noch nicht gegeben. Von Augstein bis Marion Dönhoff, von Grass bis Enzensberger, von Hochhuth bis Kempowski zeigt es die deutschen Intellektuellen, ja überhaupt die ganze bundesrepublikanische Gesellschaft, wie sie so hellsichtig nie beschrieben worden ist: wahrgenommen mit dem Sensorium eines Hochempfindsamen, subjektiv und zutreffend, anteilnehmend, scharfzüngig. Das Buch, das von der Kritik immer erhofft, von den Schriftstellern aber nie geschrieben worden ist – der große Gesellschaftsroman der Bundesrepublik, das balzacsche Porträt unserer Zeit –, hier ist es.Und vermutlich war niemand so geeignet, es zu schreiben, wie Fritz J. Raddatz. In Deutschland ist er der widersprüchlichste Intellektuelle seiner Generation: anziehend durch seinen Witz, distanzierend durch seinen Eigensinn, geistreich, gebildet, streitbar und umstritten – und immer, bei aller Geselligkeit, von einer Empfindung der Unzugehörigkeit bestimmt. Schon in den sechziger Jahren hat Erich Kuby über ihn gesagt, daß für so jemanden in Deutschland eigentlich kein Platz sei.Kubys Urteil bestätigt sich im Lebensgefühl des Tagebuchschreibers. Raddatz zeigt sich hier unmaskiert, als hochmütiger Melancholiker und treuer Freund, als Hypochonder, Misanthrop, Zweifler.

By analyzing the thought and influence of three leading critics of modern Germany, this study will demonstrate the dangers and dilemmas of a particular type of cultural despair. Lagarde, Langbehn, and Moeller van den Bruck-their active lives spanning the years from the middle of the past century to the threshold of Hitler's Third Reich-attacked, often incisively and justly, the deficiencies of German culture and the German spirit. But they were more than the critics of Germany's cultural crisis; they were its symptoms and victims as well. Unable to endure the ills which they diagnosed and which they had experienced in their own lives, they sought to become prophets who would point the way to a national rebirth. Hence, they propounded all manner of reforms, ruthless and idealistic, nationalistic and utopian. It was this leap from despair to utopia across all existing reality that gave their thought its fantastic quality.",,,,1974.0,,,,0520026268,9780520026261,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c6wwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.05,,,,,,,,,,,,367.0,,,,90.0,,,,

Frédéric Bastiat (Contributor),The Law,,English,,"How is it that the law enforcer itself does not have to keep the law? How is it that the law permits the state to lawfully engage in actions which, if undertaken by individuals, would land them in jail? These are among the most intriguing issues in political and economic philosophy. More specifically, the problem of law that itself violates law is an insurmountable conundrum of all statist philosophies. The problem has never been discussed so profoundly and passionately as in this essay by Frederic Bastiat from 1850. The essay might have been written today. It applies in ever way to our own time, which is precisely why so many people credit this one essay for showing them the light of liberty. Bastiat's essay here is timeless because applies whenever and wherever the state assumes unto itself different rules and different laws from that by which it expects other people to live. And so we have this legendary essay, written in a white heat against the leaders of 19th century France, the reading of which has shocked millions out of their toleration of despotism. This new edition from the Mises Institute revives a glorious translation that has been out of print for a hundred years, one that circulated in Britain in the generation that followed Bastiat's death. This newly available translation provides new insight into Bastiat's argument. It is a more sophisticated, more substantial, and more precise rendering than any in print. The question that Bastiat deals with: how to tell when a law is unjust or when the law maker has become a source of law breaking? When the law becomes a means of plunder it has lost its character of genuine law. When the law enforcer is permitted to do with others' lives and property what would be illegal if the citizens did them, the law becomes perverted. Bastiat doesn't avoid the difficult issues, such as why should we think that a democratic mandate can convert injustice to justice. He deals directly with the issue of the expanse of legislation: It is not true that the mission of the law is to regulate our consciences, our ideas, our will, our education, our sentiments, our sentiments, our exchanges, our gifts, our enjoyments. Its mission is to prevent the rights of one from interfering with those of another, in any one of these things. Law, because it has force for its necessary sanction, can only have the domain of force, which is justice. More from Bastiat's The Law: Socialism, like the old policy from which it emanates, confounds Government and society. And so, every time we object to a thing being done by Government, it concludes that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of education by the State - then we are against education altogether. We object to a State religion - then we would have no religion at all. We object to an equality which is brought about by the State then we are against equality, etc., etc. They might as well accuse us of wishing men not to eat, because we object to the cultivation of corn by the State. How is it that the strange idea of making the law produce what it does not contain - prosperity, in a positive sense, wealth, science, religion - should ever have gained ground in the political world? The modern politicians, particularly those of the Socialist school, found their different theories upon one common hypothesis; and surely a more strange, a more presumptuous notion, could never have entered a human brain. They divide mankind into two parts. Men in general, except one, form the first; the politician himself forms the second, which is by far the most important. Whether you buy one or one hundred, you can look forward to one of the most penetrating and powerful essays written in the history of political economy.",,,11/14/49,June 30th 2011,[],Paperback,"['Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Law', 'Classics', 'History', 'Political Science', 'Government', 'France']",,9781933550145,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1185827392l/1609224._SY475_.jpg,4.38,[],488.0,6.0,,1609224.The_Law,,,,,96.0,10521.0,61,,Ludwig von Mises Institute,"['6155', '2756', '1180', '307', '123']",,,[],,

Until now. Now a young, brilliant archeologist, Joanna, has begun to uncover and explore secrets that have long lain buried at the sacred site. For not even ten centuries have been able to obliterate completely the brutal treachery of the Benedictine monk Brother Almodius or the misfortunes of the tender-hearted Brother Roman in his forbidden love for a Celtic girl who survived ritualistic torture by the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. In an expedition at once metaphysical and archeological, reality becomes an elusive, dangerous place, and it leaves Joanna with no one she can fully trust: from her married lover, Franois, to Simon, the cosmopolitan antique dealer strangely connected to the abbey; to Guillaume, whose passion for Joanna's work comes not unalloyed; to the jealous archeologist-and devious saboteur-Patrick Fenoy. Her science increasingly challenged by inexplicable mysteries, in the embrace of peril Joanna treads the ancient stones and arcana in the depths of the Romanesque abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel as this prize-winning and artfully-crafted thriller unfolds.

Fyodor Dostoevsky;Ignat Avsey,The Karamazov Brothers,,,Fiction,"Dostoevsky's last and greatest novel, The Karamazov Brothers (1880) is both a brilliantly told crime story and a passionate philosophical debate. The dissolute landowner Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered; his sons--the atheist intellectual Ivan, the hot-blooded Dmitry, and the saintly novice Alyosha--are all involved at some level. Brilliantly bound up with this psychological drama is Dostoevsky's intense and disturbing exploration of many deeply felt ideas about the existence of God, freedom of will, the collective nature of guilt, and the disastrous consequences of rationalism. Filled with eloquent voices, this new translation fully realizes the power and dramatic virtuosity of Dostoevsky's most brilliant work.

It appeared in 1846 (his second published work) and is by far the most significant of his early stories, not least for its successful, straight-faced treatment of a hallucinatory theme.In The Double, the protagonist, Golyadkin senior, is persecuted by his double, Golyadkin junior, who resembles him closely in almost every detail. The latter abuses the former with mounting scorn and brutality as the tale proceeds toward its frightening denouement. Characteristic Dostoyevskyan themes of helplessness, victimization, and scandal are beautifully handled here with an artistry that qualifies the story as a small masterpiece.Students of literature, admirers of Dostoyevsky, and general readers will all be delighted to have this classic work available in this inexpensive but high-quality edition.

His literary output explores human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society.

His characters fall into a few distinct categories: humble and self-effacing Christians, self-destructive nihilists, and rebellious intellectuals; also, his characters are driven by ideas rather than by ordinary biological or social imperatives. His other works include: Poor Folk (1846), The Village of Stepanchikovo (1859), The Insulted and Humiliated (1861), The House of the Dead (1862), The Gambler (1867), The Idiot (1869), The Possessed (1872), The Raw Youth (1875) and A Writer's Diary (1873).",,,11/06/65,May 1st 2008,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Short Stories', 'Russian Literature', 'Literature', 'Humor', 'Novella', 'Novels', 'Classic Literature']",,9781409913597,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348025750l/7198813.jpg,3.67,[],88.0,1.0,,7198813-the-crocodile,,,,,91.0,1514.0,48,,Dodo Press,"['303', '572', '501', '115', '23']",,,"['St. Petersburg, Russia']",,

Un Dostoevskij lirico, ispirato, comincia a riflettere sulle disillusioni dell’esistenza e dell’amore nell’ultima opera pubblicata prima dell’arresto e della deportazione, esperienze che modificheranno in maniera radicale e definitiva la sua concezione dell’uomo e dell’arte. In questa edizione, al celebre racconto viene affiancata la visione “diurna” di Pietroburgo contenuta nei feuilletons che compongono la Cronaca di Pietroburgo, vero e proprio laboratorio per la scrittura dostoevskiana. Lo stretto legame tra pubblicistica e letteratura, che accompagnerà Dostoevskij negli anni della maturità, viene così a manifestarsi fin quasi dal suo esordio. Il racconto Le notti bianche ha ispirato il film omonimo di Luchino Visconti (1957), con Marcello Mastroianni e Maria Schell, e il film Quattro notti di un sognatore di Robert Bresson (1971).",,Universale economica #0187,,April 29th 2015,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Russian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Short Stories', 'Novels']",,9788807901874,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540809920l/25684046._SY475_.jpg,4.03,[],87.0,1.0,,25684046-le-notti-bianche---la-cronaca-di-pietroburgo,,,,,95.0,2983.0,152,,Feltrinelli,"['1021', '1188', '626', '124', '24']",,,[],,

With bitter sarcasm, he describes his refusal to become a worker in the ‘ant-hill’ of society and his gradual withdrawal to an existence ‘underground’. The seemingly ordinary world of St Petersburg takes on a nightmarish quality in The Double when a government clerk encounters a man who exactly resembles him – his double perhaps, or possibly the darker side of his own personality.

In this story the impulse toward self-abnegation in love, which appears so markedly in both Vanya & Natasha, isn't itself enough to direct their lives; instead, it combines with their social world & the mundane ambitions of Prince Valkovsky to defeat their hope of happiness. Of all the characters in the novel, only Natasha's lover, the Prince's son Alyosha-the person least driven to mold life to his own terms-emerges untouched.
