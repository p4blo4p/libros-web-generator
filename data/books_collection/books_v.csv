Victoria's Beginning,,[],"Breaking the line: Victoria’s Beginning follows the life of young Christian girl, Victoria Roberts. Born with White skin and blue eyes to the embarrassment of her darker skinned parents, Tess and Clyde, Victoria faces rejection and colorism at an early age. Tess and Clyde send Victoria away to Dallas to live with her childless aunts, Charlotte and Mary. Charlotte is a wealthy widow, and Mary is clairvoyant. Mary has seen the difficult road ahead for Victoria if she makes the wrong choices because of her appearance. Because of this, Charlotte, Mary, and Victoria’s maternal grandparents, Chandra and Ed, shower Victoria with love and encourage her unique intelligence and talents to help keep her on the right path. However, Clyde and Tess, along with Clyde’s domineering, voodoo practicing mother, Betts, begin to spitefully interfere and attempt to crush and cower Victoria’s spirit. Can Victoria withstand the vindictive influence of Betts and her parents? Will she be able to remain true to her faith and herself to overcome the trials of her childhood and find her destiny as an adult?

Manette Ansay re-creates a stifling world of guilt and pain, and the tormented souls who inhabit it. It is 1972 when circumstance carries Ellen Grier and her family back to Holly's Field, Wisconsin. Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill -- a loveless house suffused with the settling dust of bitterness and routine -- where calculated cruelty is a way of life preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting, and angry God.

Voyage Through Time: Walks of Life to the Nobel Prize,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction']","From a beginning in an Egyptian delta town and the port of Alexandria to the scenic vistas of sunny southern California, Ahmed Zewail takes us on a voyage through time — his own life and the split-second world of the femtosecond. In this endearing exposé of his life and work until his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1999, he draws lessons from his life story so far, and he meditates on the impact which the revolution in science has had on our modern world — in both developed and developing countries. What makes the book enchanting and engaging is Zewail's emphasis on the human dimension and his unique ability to paint the journey of Life and Science with insightful analogies and ingenious metaphors.But this inspiring book goes far beyond the usual province of an autobiography. Zewail integrates the two worlds he equally belongs to — Egypt and America — and, despite differences, he emphasizes the confluence of the two cultures — the East and the West. He rejects the view that the current state of the world is due to a clash of civilizations or a conflict of religions, and suggests a concrete course of action for the world of the have-nots. The book ends with his road map for a partnership between developed and developing worlds.

Cómo jodieron al general Villarroel, cómo derrotaron nuestras victorias. Porque, hasta ahora, de aquella guerra solo he oído las versiones que vienen de arriba o del enemigo.» VICTUS es una novela histórica que nos narra la guerra de Sucesión española, un conflicto que puede considerarse como la primera de las contiendas mundiales y que termina el 11 de septiembre de 1714 con el apocalíptico asalto a Barcelona. También es la tragedia de Martí Zuviría, un joven barcelonés, alumno aventajado del marqués de Vauban, que se convierte en un genio de la ingeniería militar. VICTUS es un derroche de información y rigor histórico al servicio de un relato ágil, potente y desenfadado, con una dicción rabiosamente contemporánea que nos lleva de Francia a Barcelona pasando por Madrid, Toledo, Tortosa o las batallas de Brihuega y Almansa. Y es también una obra sobre la Barcelona irreductible de 1714, que sufrió un asedio desigual de trece meses y el bombardeo de más de treinta mil proyectiles. VICTUS cuestiona las versiones oficiales de ambos bandos y cede la palabra a los auténticos protagonistas de la historia, desde la figura inmensa de Villarroel, el general que defendió la capital catalana con lágrimas en los ojos, hasta los civiles y soldados anónimos de todas las naciones que lucharon a un lado y otro de las murallas. Pero, ante todo, VICTUS es un festín literario de primer orden que se devora del modo en que siempre se han devorado las grandes obras, como lo demuestra el que antes de su aparición ya se hayan vendido los derechos al ruso, el alemán, el holandés y el francés. «Un huracán de aire fresco, una iconoclasta visión desde abajo que rehace el mito de 1714 con más potencia.

Valley of Stars,,['Contemporary Romance'],"Millions of readers have fallen in love with Ava's bestselling books...come join the family.  International Bestselling Author Ava Miles’ acclaimed family series, The Merriams, returns with a fun and feel good romantic comedy filled with second chances, everyone’s favorite matchmakers, and lots of high stakes and adventure.  Boyd McClellan is a smooth-talking, wicked-smart, lying jerk.  True, Michaela Merriam isn’t objective where her ex-boyfriend and former business partner is concerned, but she’s justified given he screwed her—and her family’s corporation—over.  Except Boyd is back and dangling the discovery of a lifetime: the location of a rare flower known to cure all illness. He claims that without her, he can’t bring it back.  Yeah, right.  Trusting him seems stupid. She did before and look where that got her: brokenhearted and with a demotion. But she doesn't have any choice but to accompany him to the fabled Valley of Stars after her bossy Mr. President brother orders her to go to make up for her love-sick snafu.  She's definitely not stupid enough to go alone. She's bringing her own chaperones: her beloved Uncle Arthur and Aunt Clara. One caveat: absolutely NO matchmaking.  Trekking in the savannah isn’t like “The Lion King.” Worse, the deeper they go in, the sexier the safari becomes. Michaela doesn’t understand Boyd’s game, and he’s playing his cards close to his vest. She hopes her aunt and uncle will be able to help her figure out his endgame before anyone—namely, her—gets hurt. Because lying with him under the African night sky, she realizes that she’s falling for him all over again. But can she trust it—and him?  PRAISE: ""Ava's story is witty and charming.""

Volpone,,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', '17th Century', 'School', 'British Literature', 'Poetry', 'English Literature']","Volphone's reverential prayer to his heaps of gold launches the sharpest, funniest play about money and morals in the 17th century - a play still wickedly relevant on the same topics four centuries later. Ben Jonson's comedy depicts selfishness thinly veiled by sanctimonious speeches, lust and possessiveness poorly disguised as love and marriage, and cynical legalism passing itself off as pure justice, alongside snobbery, class warfare and greed. The wily protagonists keep a dozen conventional plots spinning in the minds of their dupes, and when their amazing juggling act finally unravels, there are yet more twists - and an even deeper cynicisim - to the story. The play is partly a beast-fable: the wily fox, Volpone, plays dead to lure flesh-eating birds that he can then consume. But the beasts are the human race, and polite society the biggest, greediest scam of them all.This student edition contains a lengthy Introduction with background on the author, date and sources, critical interpretation and stage history.Robert N.

The trees sit on a black lake that resembles a dark Louisiana bayou with an evocative aura. The dream includes the presence of a man who seems to know Anna all too well and a group of people with strange telepathic powers, sometimes called veiled eyes. An orphan from Texas, she is on her way east to help out a friend when she encounters two terrifying things. Psychically, she begins to see and hear things through the eyes of an unknown individual, a man who knows more about her than she ever would have imagined. The second thing is that she has been kidnapped by a sociopathic trucker intent on making her his latest victim. When she is rescued by Gabriel Bergeron, a member of the elusive Lake People in Northwestern Louisiana, Anna doesn’t realize that he is her psychic counterpart and she has been inexplicably pulled to the area. She shares their strange colored gold eyes and their distinctive mental powers. They are a reclusive lot and know that Anna is one of them, but has been isolated by unknown circumstances. She is drawn into their incomparable world, something between that of the Creoles and Cajuns, and much in addition to those. There Anna finds a romantic link with Gabriel and the spine-tingling fear of not knowing who to trust.

Voodoo in My Blood: A Healer's Journey from Surgeon to Shaman,,['Memoir'],"Born and raised in Haiti to a family of healers, Dr. Carolle Jean-Murat completed her medical training in the US and settled in San Diego in 1982. She soon was regarded as one of the best gynecologic surgeons around-tall and regal, a lone black female among the elite. But her success harbored a secret: when a patient entered her office, Dr. Jean-Murat could quickly and intuitively see the root cause of her patient's illness, often times knowing she could help the patient without having to put her under the knife. Carolle knew she dare not make these claims aloud. Struggling to fit in with the Western medical paradigm, her intuition and vision were best left unmentioned.Harboring secrets wasn't new to Carolle, who grew up in Papa Doc Duvalier's Haiti where the threat of being snatched by the Tontons Macoutes was a daily fear. Her own father, after being tortured, miraculously escaped death and was forced to leave the country in the middle of the night, ending up as an illegal immigrant in New York City.In Carolle's society, everything had a dire price-including admitting openly to the practice of voodoo. This, too, would shape her life. A mere four-year old, Carolle was taken from her family home, and sent to live with her paternal grandmother and aunt because her own mother was a voodoo practitioner. Nevertheless, fate would find a way of returning Carolle to her.As a teenager Carolle became gravely ill; even the doctors had given up on her. With no other recourse, she was taken to her maternal grandfather where she stayed in his healing room in his voodoo temple. There, he and Carolle's mother exposed her to voodoo healing, mixing a potent potion she had to drink. They proclaimed her healed- and indeed, she was. Though she returned to live with her paternal grandmother, where once again she was told to never tell that she had been exposed to voodoo, her mother and grandfather had told her differently: 'You can run, but you can't hide from what you know. Voodoo, is in your blood.' Thus began Carolle's hidden and tumultuous relationship with this African-based paradigm of healing.For years Carolle struggled inwardly to reconcile her family's healing heritage; even outwardly she was forced to pass up many opportunities, in order to keep her family a secret. Once immersed in Western medical practice, Carolle constantly struggled with bringing her intuition to the forefront-healing through the spirit and not just the surgeon's knife.

It was to last five years and transform him from an amiable and somewhat aimless young man into a scientific celebrity. Even more vitally, it was to set in motion the intellectual currents that culminated in the arrival of The Origin of Species in Victorian drawing-rooms in 1859. His journal, reprinted here in a shortened version, is vivid and immediate, showing us a naturalist making patient observations, above all in geology. As well as a profusion of natural history detail, it records many other things that caught Darwin’s eye, from civil war in Argentina to the new colonial settlements of Australia.

Via Chanel n. 5,,"['Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Italy']","È possibile assomigliare a una delle più grandi icone dello stile, indipendente, bella, desiderata ed elegante come Coco Chanel? Rebecca ha trentatré anni, più di cento paia di scarpe, un armadio pieno di tubini neri, completi di tweed e una smisurata passione per la magnifica Coco. È romantica, sognatrice, e follemente innamorata di Niccolò, che sta per raggiungere a Milano, dopo un anno di relazione a distanza. Un nuovo lavoro come wedding planner, una vita vicino all'uomo che ama: la felicità sembra a portata di mano. Ma una brutta sorpresa è in agguato: appena giunta nella metropoli, Niccolò le confessa di essersi innamorato di un'altra. Rebecca si ritrova così in una città che non conosce e con il cuore a pezzi. Ma il suo mito, la grande Coco, come avrebbe reagito? Indossando degli enormi occhiali scuri, alzando la testa in segno di sfida, non avrebbe mai permesso a un uomo di schiacciare il suo spirito ribelle e anticonvenzionale! ""Per essere insostituibili bisogna essere unici"", e forse Niccolò, unico non lo era. Dopo intere giornate chiusa a casa, Rebecca è pronta a voltare pagina: si tuffa nell'intensa vita mondana milanese e, con lo stile della sua eroina, assapora la sensazione di sentirsi una donna cercata e desiderata.

If there were speed limits for the sheer pulse-racing excitement allowed in one novel, ""Velocity"" would break them all. Get ready for the ride of your life. Bill Wiles is an easygoing, hardworking guy who leads a quiet, ordinary life. But that is about to change. One evening, after his usual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note under the windshield wiper of his car. 
  ""If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I will kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to the police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity work. You have four hours to decide. The choice is yours.""
It seems like a sick joke, and Bill's friend on the police force, Lanny Olson, thinks so too. His advice to Bill is to go home and forget about it. Besides, what could they do even if they took the note seriously? No crime has actually been committed. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young blond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Bill's fault: he didn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another note, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives hanging in the balance. Suddenly Bill's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the dimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the notes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the killer becoming bolder and crueler with every communication--until Bill is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has the power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims. Until the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal.

This book integrates the problem of violence into a larger social science and historical framework, showing how economic and political behavior are closely linked. Most societies, which we call natural states, limit violence by political manipulation of the economy to create privileged interests. These privileges limit the use of violence by powerful individuals, but doing so hinders both economic and political development. In contrast, modern societies create open access to economic and political organizations, fostering political and economic competition. The book provides a framework for understanding the two types of social orders, why open access societies are both politically and economically more developed, and how some 25 countries have made the transition between the two types.",,,01/01/09,April 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,,9780521761734,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347607871l/5385951.jpg,4.02,[],100.0,1.0,,,,96.0,202.0,308,Cambridge University Press,"['71', '77', '45', '6', '3']",,[],,"['Douglass C.

Villains by Necessity,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Adventure', 'High Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Adult', 'Unfinished']","With the banishment of Evil from the realms, the final victory of Good is assured-unless a few stalwart antiheroes can save the world from a serious and potentially fatal imbalance. First novelist Forward explores the complications that arise from a surfeit of ""goodness"" in the world. The result is a skewed version of the epic fantasy that features an assassin, a thief, an evil sorceress, a dark knight, and an implacable druid as the villains-turned-heroes who must restore the delicate balance of opposing forces before their world disappears in a blinding flash of Goodness and Light. -- Library JournalForward's first novel gives the concept of the balance between good and evil a most ingenious twist: What if good were so totally triumphant that it became a worse danger than evil, and a band of unemployed evil characters had to go on a desperate quest to find the means of putting the saving bit of evil back into the world? The result of this twist is an almost straightforward quest tale, with numerous well-drawn characters (including a centaur who starts off as a secret agent for good and eventually joins the side of evil), great ingenuity about magic, very creditable world-building, and considerable wit. Although bearing its share of first-novel flaws, it has many more virtues, which include an underlying, serious examination of the good-evil dichotomy that is the basis of so many role-playing games. -- Roland Green",,,10/29/95,March 1st 1996,[],Paperback,,9780812522280,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335913626l/401454.jpg,4.19,[],198.0,2.0,,,,93.0,1559.0,544,Tom Doherty Assoc Llc,"['772', '448', '234', '66', '39']",,[],,['Eve Forward']

Lovely Venetia despairs of ever meeting the handsome hero of her romantic dreams but is nearly resigned to spinsterhood, thanks to the enormous amount of responsibility she inherited with a Yorkshire estate and an invalid but precocious brother, Aubrey. She lives in comfortable seclusion in rural Yorkshire, she has never been further than Harrogate, nor enjoyed the lackluster attentions of any but her two wearisomely persistent suitors. She can not accept to marry the respectable but dull Edward Yardley - she will only marry for love.Then her long-absent neighbor, thirty-eight-year-old Lord Jasper Damerel, returns home to Yorkshire. In one extraordinary encounter, she meets the infamous neighbor, who she knows only by reputation - a gamester, a shocking rake, and a man of sadly unsteady character - and before she knows better, she finds friendship with a libertine whose way of life has scandalised the North Riding for years. Lord Damerel finds Venetia to be the most truly engaging and wittily perverse female he has encountered in all his life and determined to woo and win her, he pursues her with a passionate abandon that is soon the talk of the ton. And after her encounter with the dashing, dangerous rake, Venetia's well-ordered life is turned upside down, and she embarks upon a courtship with him that scandalises and horrifies the whole community.But Venetia has no intention of losing her heart to the rakish lord until she is sure that beneath his swashbuckling ways and shocking manners lies a tender heart belonging to her.

  Detective Alex Cross must confront his most terrifying nemesis ever-and his own deepest fears-in this electrifying new thriller from the master of suspense, James Patterson.
Alex Cross has never believed in vampires. But when two joggers are found slain in a manner that suggests a macabre ritual, he has to reconsider. Someone believes in vampires enough to have committed a series of bizarre murders that appear to be the work of one. Local police are horrified, and even the FBI is baffled.Cross takes on the case and plunges into a netherworld of secret clubs and role-players, a world full of poseurs and playactors-and someone demented enough to have crossed the line from dark ritual to real blood. At the same time, a lethal super-criminal from Cross's past known as the Mastermind is stalking him, taunting him, and threatening everything he holds dear. Cross has never been closer to defeat, or in greater danger. In a shocking conclusion, Alex Cross must survive a deadly confrontation-only to discover at last the awful secret of the Mastermind.",Alex Cross #7,,11/19/01,October 1st 2002,"['Alex Cross', 'Kyle Craig', 'Jamilla ""Jam"" Hughes', 'Kate McTiernan']",Paperback,,9780446611213,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440196942l/79379._SY475_.jpg,3.97,[],177.0,5.0,,,,95.0,55656.0,391,Grand Central Publishing,"['17687', '22030', '12982', '2257', '700']",,"['Washington, D.C.

She and her mother lived in genteel poverty for most of her childhood, exiled from court because of her mother's dislike of her uncles, George IV and William IV. A strong, willful child, Victoria was determined not to be stifled by her powerful uncles or her unpopular, controlling mother. Then one morning, at the age of eighteen, Princess Victoria awoke to the news of her uncle William's death. The almost-forgotten princess was now Queen of England. Even better, she was finally free of her mother's iron hand and her uncles' manipulations. Her first act as queen was to demand that she be given a room--and a bed--of her own.Victoria's marriage to her German cousin, Prince Albert, was a blissfully happy one that produced nine children. Albert was her constant companion and one of her most trusted advisors. Victoria's grief after Prince Albert's untimely death was so shattering that for the rest of her life--nearly forty years--she dressed only in black. She survived several assassination attempts, and during her reign England's empire expanded around the globe until it touched every continent in the world.Derided as a mere ""girl queen"" at her coronation, by the end of her sixty-four-year reign, Victoria embodied the glory of the British Empire.

Viva O Povo Brasileiro,,"['Brazil', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Romance', 'Latin American', 'Novels', 'Unfinished']","Esta edição especial marca os trinta anos de publicação de um dos mais importantes romances surgidos na literatura brasileira no século XX. Viva o povo brasileiro, exuberante e complexa metáfora da formação de nossa identidade nacional, é obra monumental que já nasceu clássica, instaurando novo olhar ficcional sobre o passado do Brasil. A violência física e simbólica, os abismos sociais e os privilégios que os acentuam, a constituição de uma elite autoritária são encenados ao longo desta narrativa polifônica e lírica, muitas vezes irônica, que cobre quatrocentos anos de história. Poucas obras atingiram esse mesmo nível de complexidade, e pouquíssimas alcançaram êxito semelhante ao de Viva o povo brasileiro. Frequentemente, os “romances históricos” brasileiros resvalam para o didatismo maniqueísta ou o exotismo anedótico, mantendo o passado a uma distância segura. Neste romance sob todos os aspectos monumental, João Ubaldo Ribeiro empreende profunda e complexa reflexão sobre a formação da identidade nacional, construindo passagens e personagens que já nasceram clássicos, frutos de sofisticada elaboração literária que se traduz em minuciosa pesquisa de formas e linguagens — nas quais sobejam a ironia, o fantástico, o assombro místico e até certo lirismo. Viva o povo brasileiro é terrivelmente envolvente. Terrivelmente porque o livro encena, sem o menor pudor, a violência física e simbólica inerente à colonização da América portuguesa e, no início do século XIX, à instituição do Estado brasileiro — que, hábil em preservar privilégios e contrastes sociais ainda hoje tão indisfarçáveis, se constitui sobre o mesmo escravismo colonial.",,Edição Especial de 30 Anos,10/30/84,November 1st 2014,"['Perilo Ambrósio', 'A Almazinha']",Paperback,,9788579623004,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412880291l/23349181.jpg,4.43,['Prêmio Jabuti for Romance (1985)'],97.0,1.0,,,,96.0,581.0,672,Alfaguara Brasil,"['353', '158', '44', '20', '6']",,[],,['João Ubaldo Ribeiro']

Visionary Shamanism: Activating the Imaginal Cells of the Human Energy Field,,[],"Shamanic practices to access your spiritual blueprint, communicate with the universal mind, and transform in to your highest spiritual self  • Explains how to tune in to imaginal cells to heal the past, activate the shaman within, and download information from the future  • Includes shamanic breathwork practices and rituals to open access to your spiritual blueprint--the hologram of who your highest, best self is meant to be--and be more potent and powerful in the present  • Includes 55-minute Visionary Shamanism Musical Journeys CD  We are in a highly transitional time on Earth as old structures break down in preparation for the new world that is coming. The accelerated pace of this time of spiritual evolution is forcing each of us to awaken the shaman within and reach our highest potential as quickly as possible.

By tuning in to these imaginal cells, you can open access to your spiritual blueprint--the hologram of who your highest, best self is meant to be--and accelerate your evolutionary potential in this lifetime. Including information received by Star Wolf from the future, the book explores how to develop a communication link with the universe, receive guidance from the universal mind, and draw information from the future to be more potent and powerful in the present, live in harmony with one another and the planet, and fully prepare yourself for the new world to come.",,,,October 19th 2011,[],Paperback,,9781591431312,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364138487l/12751521.jpg,3.89,[],100.0,1.0,,,,89.0,28.0,192,Bear Company,"['11', '6', '8', '3', '0']",,[],,"['Linda Star Wolf', 'Anne Dillon']"

Vertical Thoughts: Morton Feldman and the Visual Arts,,"['Art', 'Music', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction']","If any music can be said to be painterly, it is that of Morton Feldman (1926-1987), one of the most influential composers of the twentieth century. Feldman (1926-1987) was deeply immersed in the milieu of New York Abstract Expressionism, and found analogies in sound to the materiality of Pollock, the gravitas of Rothko and the hesitant, venturing brushstrokes of Guston. Taking as its departure point an exhibition Feldman curated in 1967 titled Six Painters, Vertical Thoughts considers the impact that postwar American art had on Feldman's own compositions. It features works by the six painters -- Guston, Kline, Mondrian, de Kooning, Pollock and Rothko -- and by other artists whom Feldman admired, such as Kitaj, Rauschenberg and Twombly. Also reproduced are works from Feldman's own collection, including his Middle Eastern and Asian rugs, archival photographs and ephemera, musical scores and record covers of compositions dedicated to artists such as Guston and Rothko, besides interviews with and writings by Feldman himself.",,,11/06/10,July 31st 2010,[],Paperback,,9781907020087,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347240284l/8182179.jpg,4.58,[],90.0,1.0,,,,100.0,24.0,319,Irish Museum of Modern Art,"['15', '8', '1', '0', '0']",,[],,"['Morton Feldman', 'Juan Manuel Bonet', 'Francesco Pellizzi', 'Bunita Marcus', 'Kevin Volans', 'Barbara Monk Feldman', ""Brian O'Doherty"", 'Dore Ashton']"

But so powerful is her sight, so fragile the state of her mind, that the very emotions she yearns to embrace could be the end of her.Changeling Vaughn D'Angelo can take the form of either man or jaguar, but it is his animal side that is overwhelmingly drawn to Faith. The jaguar's instinct is to claim this woman it finds so utterly fascinating and the man has no argument. But while Vaughn craves sensation and hungers to pleasure Faith in every way, desire is a danger that could snap the last threads of her sanity. And there are Psy who need Faith's sight for their own purposes. They must keep her silenced - and keep her from Vaughn.",Psy-Changeling #2,,,March 6th 2007,"['Sascha Duncan', 'Lucas Hunter', 'Faith Nightstar', 'Judd Lauren', 'Clay Bennett', 'Dorian Christensen', 'Nikita Duncan', ""Vaughn D'Angelo"", 'Anthony Kyriakus']",Mass Market Paperback,,9780425215753,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388450756l/215643.jpg,4.11,['Sir Julius Vogel Award Nominee for Best Adult Novel (2008)'],393.0,6.0,,,,96.0,33442.0,332,Berkley Sensation,"['12942', '12815', '6271', '1149', '265']",,"['San Francisco Bay Area, California (United States)']",,['Nalini Singh']

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.In Veronika Decides to Die, Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.",On the Seventh Day #2,,10/28/98,06/01/06,"['Boston ""Mari"" Maribu', 'Athena (Greek goddess)', 'Veronika', 'Eduard', 'Dr. Igor', 'Zedka']",Paperback,,9780061124266,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348139939l/1431.jpg,3.7,[],11482.0,142.0,,,,87.0,174383.0,210,Harper Perennial,"['47198', '58406', '45767', '16113', '6899']",,['Ljubljana (Slovenia)'],,"['Paulo Coelho', 'Margaret Jull Costa', 'Kâmuran Şipal']"

Voices of the Stars,,"['Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction']","“Voices of the Stars” is a sweeping, heroic saga - presented in an Arthurian setting in a very historically accurate Post-Roman land of the Britons. It is a metaphysical, psychological, action/adventure, myth and magic, tragic romance, medieval warfare, fantasy, historical fiction novel.“Voices of the Stars” is the true, in-depth, eye-witness chronicle of the world of the King, Arthur, and his compatriots of his Alliance of the 5 distinct cultures living on “These Our Fair Isles”: the original Old Dark Tribes, the Celtic Clans, the Roman-styled Britons, the Picti and the original, ‘legal’ Saxons, whose land was obtained through barter with Vortigern. It is also the real story of Arthur and Morgan’s tragic, Star-crossed love for one another, the devoted loyalty of their brother of the heart, Bedwyr, the strength of their mother, Igraine, Great Seer of the Old Dark Tribes, the treachery of their other sister Morganna le Faye, and the never before told story of the only child of Arthur’s blood, Mordred.Woven into the rich Dark Age tapestry of this magnificently complex, emotionally charged novel – the first in its series – are the Old Ways, The Old Gods, the Great Goddess and the Goddesses Nine, Magic, Seers, Enchantresses, Druids, Dragons, Ancient Rituals, medieval warfare, and the Leonardo DaVinci of his day - Gwyddion, the Merlin. It is filled with intrigue, passion, treachery, love, and with Epic Poetry throughout. It follows this evocative tale through five generations and is an intricately involved work with many legendary, historical and original characters.These now revealed histories debunk the cliché flights of fancy that have attached themselves to Arthurian legend in the intervening centuries - both in Renaissance and modern tellings, going back to post Roman days of the Cymru, the pre-Welsh clans.“Voices of the Stars” is the story of how Arthur’s sister, Morgan of the Woods, realizing the import of her time, bids all of her brother Arthur’s close allies, kith, and kin to write their “histories” – their autobiographies – as their lives unfold. All events – such as battles – are seen and written from the differing perspective of each contributor. We come to know the truth of “Voices’” characters - their joys, tragedies, hopes, dreams, ambitions, accomplishments, failures, desires, fears, loves, and hatreds are written into their stories. Tricks of the Fates abound throughout their lives as each comes to accept their shadow selves, weaknesses, flaws, hidden desires, strengths and goodness.These histories are to be secreted away for the sake of posterity. Why? To put it into Morgan’s words:“What lies within these vellum pages is an history... which I, Morgan, have compiled to preserve the truth of these matters - because, it is a fact that legends of the simple folk, as well as songs and poems of the Bards, gallop into fancy like Warhorses to the smell of blood. What begins as a simple pattern, weaves, entwines and spreads like the gossamer threads of Arachne –ultimately and forever changing the meaning of events as they truly were.”Within its pages the Cosmic Mysteries are revealed and taught through an original and complete spiritual Mystery System of the Great Aixia and the “Goddesses Nine” – replete with ancient Gods, Myths, Seasonal Rites, Moon Rituals, chants and secret initiations of The Order on The Isle of Apples.",Voices of the Stars #1,,,August 4th 2014,[],ebook,,9781618683137,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420761409l/22884430.jpg,4.12,[],97.0,1.0,,,,88.0,66.0,,Smashwords Edition,"['35', '12', '11', '8', '0']",,[],,['Rowena Whaling']

Veritable Key of Solomon,,"['Occult', 'Magic', 'Magick', 'Witchcraft']","""The Key of Solomon"" is the most famous and infamous of the Grimoires ever produced. Yet amazingly only one version of it has ever been published, by S L MacGregor Mathers, over 100 years ago. What Mathers may not have known is that there were much more detailed and complete versions of this grimoire available in many other languages. This is not just a variant of Mathers' text, but a translation of three completely different and beautifully illustrated 1796 French manuscripts of the Key of Solomon. These are the most beautiful and complete manu-scripts of ""The Key of Solomon"" ever published. Much of the detail omitted from Mathers' edition is given here, providing a complete and workable system of high magic with full details of implements, procedures, and a wide range of talismans. Much material not available to Mathers is also found in this extraordinary book, including planetary prayers, names of angels and demons, and a vast array of pentacles, as well as material on the Olympic Spirits, Planetary Spirits and Intelligences. The commentary by two of the best known scholar-magicians provides much additional material, a full survey of all the extant manuscripts of this famous grimoire and how they relate to each other, as well as the historical influence of the Key of Solomon on the development of magic from the Renaissance until now. The pentacles as drawn by Fyot, the original scribe, are reproduced here, with more than twice as many pentacles as were produced in Mathers' text. ""The Key of Solomon"" is the most significant magical grimoire ever penned, certainly for the period from the sixteenth through to the nineteenth century. This present work finally restores ""The Key of Solomon"" back to its place at the heart of practical Western magic.",,,01/01/08,January 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780955738760,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451723712l/28428971._SX318_.jpg,4.63,[],99.0,1.0,,,,98.0,60.0,446,Golden Hoard Press,"['46', '7', '6', '1', '0']",,[],,"['Stephen Skinner', 'David Rankine']"
Van Gogh: The Life,,"['Art', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Art History', 'Biography Memoir', 'France', 'Memoir', '19th Century', 'Unfinished']","Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith galvanized readers with their astonishing Jackson Pollock: An American Saga, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for biography, a book acclaimed for its miraculous research and overwhelming narrative power. Now Naifeh and Smith have written another tour de force—an exquisitely detailed, compellingly readable, and ultimately heartbreaking portrait of creative genius Vincent van Gogh.Working with the full cooperation of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Naifeh and Smith have accessed a wealth of previously untapped materials. While drawing liberally from the artist’s famously eloquent letters, they have also delved into hundreds of unpublished family correspondences, illuminating with poignancy the wanderings of Van Gogh’s troubled, restless soul. Naifeh and Smith bring a crucial understanding to the larger-than-life mythology of this great artist—his early struggles to find his place in the world; his intense relationship with his brother Theo; his impetus for turning to brush and canvas; and his move to Provence, where in a brief burst of incandescent productivity he painted some of the best-loved works in Western art.The authors also shed new light on many unexplored aspects of Van Gogh’s inner world: his deep immersion in literature and art; his erratic and tumultuous romantic life; and his bouts of depression and mental illness.Though countless books have been written about Van Gogh, and though the broad outlines of his tragedy have long inhabited popular culture, no serious, ambitious examination of his life has been attempted in more than seventy years. Naifeh and Smith have re-created Van Gogh’s life with an astounding vividness and psychological acuity that bring a completely new and sympathetic understanding to this unique artistic genius whose signature images of sunflowers and starry nights have won a permanent place in the human imagination.868 pages of text, 953 pages with notes",,,2011,October 18th 2011,"['Vincent van Gogh', 'Paul Gauguin', 'Theo van Gogh']",Hardcover,,9780375507489,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411005913l/10677213.jpg,4.09,['Society of Midland Authors Award for Biography (2012)'],46.0,2.0,,,,90.0,18565.0,950,Random House,"['8821', '5097', '2882', '993', '772']",,[],,"['Steven Naifeh', 'Gregory White Smith']"

In ""Odd Jobs,"" Dave, who owns a record store called the Vinyl Café, wants to install an outlet in his kitchen at home.

When an airline staffer arrives and remarks on how early he is, he says, ""I always try to be. I've never understood those people who wait until the last moment.""

According to mission reports from the Army Air Forces, the plane crashed in shallow water—but when investigators went to find it, the wreckage wasn't there. Witnesses saw the crew parachute to safety, yet the airmen were never seen again. Some of their relatives whispered that they had returned to the United States in secret and lived in hiding. But they never explained why.For sixty years, the U.S. government, the children of the missing airmen, and a maverick team of scientists and scuba divers searched the islands for clues. They trolled the water with side-scan sonar, conducted grid searches on the seafloor, crawled through thickets of mangrove and poison trees, and flew over the islands in small planes to shoot infrared photography. With every clue they found, the mystery only deepened.Now, in a spellbinding narrative, Wil S. Hylton weaves together the true story of the missing men, their final mission, the families they left behind, and the real reason their disappearance remained shrouded in secrecy for so long. This is a story of love, loss, sacrifice, and faith—of the undying hope among the families of the missing, and the relentless determination of scientists, explorers, archaeologists, and deep-sea divers to solve one of the enduring mysteries of World War II.",,,11/06/13,November 5th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9781594487279,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367785757l/17707499.jpg,3.93,[],91.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1941.0,288,Riverhead Books,"['581', '801', '427', '99', '33']",,[],,['Wil S.

"Viktor Rydberg's Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume II, Part 1: Indo-European Mythology",,[],"The Nebra Disc (front cover) informs archaeologists that the Bronze Age people of Northern Europe were more sophisticated than once thought. In an area traditionally seen as primitive and barbaric, it would seem a complex religion had flourished more than 3,600 years ago. ""We have been dramatically underestimating the prehistoric peoples,"" says Harald Meller, Head Archaeologist at the Museum of Halle in Saxony-Anhalt, where the Nebra disc was discovered.Scientists have long known that most Europeans languages stem from an older Proto-Indo-European root, perhaps originating in the Russian Steppes c. 4000-6000 BC. Many have speculated about the culture and the religion of its speakers, but few in as great detail as Viktor Rydberg. Here he illuminates Proto-Indo-European beliefs through a comparative analysis of its earliest religious texts, among them, the Rigveda, the Zend-Avesta, and the Icelandic Poetic and Prose Eddas, concluding with his own thoughts on mythological method. This, the second volume of Rydberg's two-volume Unders�kningar i Germanisk Mythologi, is the sequel to his Teutonic Mythology.Insightful research from the dawn of comparative mythological studies, these controversial essays remain as relevant today, as they were when they were published over a century ago.This is the first part of a two-part set.",,,,February 16th 2007,[],Paperback,,9780595420209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347272703l/2494295.jpg,4.43,[],98.0,1.0,,,,100.0,7.0,280,iUniverse,"['4', '2', '1', '0', '0']",,[],,"['William P.

Vie devant soi de Romain Gary (Émile Ajar),,"['France', 'Fiction', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'French Literature', 'School']","Le lecteur actuel de ""La vie devant soi"" lit ce roman comme une oeuvre de Romain Gary dont le pseudonyme, Émile Ajar, se trouve seulement indiqué entre parenthèses sur la couverture. Il peut donc se poser les véritables questions sur la valeur littéraire du roman ainsi que sur ses significations, et envisager sereinement l'ensemble Gary-Ajar. Celui de 1975, en revanche, découvrait, lui, un livre signé Ajar, dont la nouveauté le séduisait ou l'irritait, mais qu'il appréhendait à travers un tapage médiatico-littéraire, paroxystique au moment de sa publication. Favorable certes au retentissement de l'oeuvre, ce vacarme risquait d'en obscurcir l'intérêt intrinsèque. Il y eut, au début, un «mystère Ajar», puis très vite une «affaire Ajar» dont nous pouvons dérouler les principales étapes, d'abord selon le point de vue, mystifié, du public, jusqu'à la révélation posthume de la vérité (en juillet 1981), puis en suivant la perspective des intéressés qui dévoilèrent la face cachée de l'aventure.Un essaiÉtude approfondie d'un grand texte classique ou contemporain par un spécialiste de l'oeuvre: approche critique originale des multiples facettes du texte dans une présentation claire et rigoureuse.Un dossierBibliographie, chronologie, variantes, témoignages, extraits de presse.
