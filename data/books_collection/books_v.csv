Cassaforte is home to sixteen-year-old Risa Divetri, whose fate is about to be decided by the gods.

If she's not meant to be a glass maker, what will she do?

The so-called thrid World has produced no more brilliant literary artist' John Updike, New Yorker Born of Indian heritage, raised in the British-dependent Caribbean island of Isabella, and educated in England, forty-year-old Ralph Singh has spent a lifetime struggling against the torment of cultural displacement. Now in exile from his native country, he has taken up residence at a quaint hotel in a London suburb, where he is writing his memoirs in an attempt to impose order on a chaotic existence. His memories lead him to recognize the cultural paradoxes and tainted fantasies of his colonial childhood and later life: his attempts to fit in at school, his short-lived marriage to an ostenatious white woman. But it is the return of Isabella and his subsequent immersion in the roiling political atmosphere of a newly self-governing nation - every kind of racial fantasy taking wing - that ultimately provide Singh with the necessary insight to discover the crux of his disillusionment.

V. S.

I had to be the man who had planned it all, who had come to the destroyed town at the bend in the river because he had foreseen the rich future. `Salim, the narrator, is a young man from an Indian family of traders long resident on the coast of Centeral Africa. Salim has left the coast to make his way in the interior, there to take on a small trading shop of this and that, sudries, sold to the natives. The place is “a bend in the river”; it is Africa. The time is post-colonial, the time of Independence. The Europeans have withdrawn or been forced to withdraw and the scene is one of chaos, violent change, warring tribes, ignorance, isolation, poverty and a lack of prepartion for the modern world they have entered, or partially assumed as a sort of decoration. It is a story of historical upheaval and social breakdown. Naipaul has fashioned a work of intense imaginative force. It is a haunting creation, rich with incident and human bafflement, played out in an immense detail of landscape rendered with a poignant brilliance.`Elizabeth Hardwick `Always a master of fictional landscape, Naipaul here shows, in his variety of human examples and in his search for underlying social causes, a Tolstoyan spirit`John Updike",,,,2002.0,,,,0330487140,9780330487146,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1zfGyiYEQ8UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.77,,,,,,,,,,,,326.0,,,,12714.0,,,,

V. S. Ramachandran,Phantoms in the Brain,Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind,,Medical,"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases: A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial. A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious experience? A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time. Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the ""big questions"" about consciousness and the self.",,,,1999.0,,,,0688172172,9780688172176,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TMnuNquN2RgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.25,,,,,,,,,,,,352.0,,,,14549.0,,,,

Then Heaven's stepmother ran off, and her wicked, greedy father had a scheme -- a vicious scheme that threatened to destroy the precious dream of Heaven and the children forever!",Casteel #1,,11/01/85,November 1st 1990,['Heaven Casteel'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Gothic', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Chick Lit']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595219799l/787660.jpg,4.03,[],423.0,5.0,,787660.Heaven,,,,,93.0,21876.0,440,,Pocket Books,"['8643', '6958', '4824', '1158', '293']",,,"['Georgia (United States)', 'West Virginia (United States)']",,

V.D. Savarkar,माझी जन्मठेप,,Marathi,,"The story is told. The curtain has been brought down on it. Two life-sentences have been run. And I have brought together my recollections of them within the cover of this book. They are narrated in brief and put together within the narrowest.When I came into this world, God sent me here possibly on a sort of life-sentence. It was the span of life allotted to me by time to stay in this ‘prison-house of life’. This story is but a chapter of that book of life, which is a longer story not yet ended. You can finish reading the book in a day, while I had to live it for 14 long years of transportation. And if the story is so tiresome, unendurable and disgusting to you, how much must have been the living of it for me! Every moment of those 14 years in that jail has been an agony of the soul and the body to me, and to my fellow convicts in that jail. It was not only fatiguing, unbearable and futile to us all, it was equally or more excruciating to them as to me. And it is only that you may know it and feel the fatigue, the disgust and the pain of it as we have felt it, that I have chosen to write it for you. —Excerpts from this bookThis is the story of Swatantrayaveer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar—a great revolutionary, politician, poet and seer who tried to free India from the British yoke!British policy was to torture and persecute the political prisoners/revolutionaries so that they would reveal the names of all their colleagues or go mad or commit suicide. My Transportation for Life is a firsthand story of the sufferings and humiliation of an inmate of the infamous Cellular Jail of Andamans, the legendary Kala Paani. The physical tortures inside the high walls were made all the more insufferable by the sickening attitude of the men who mattered—the native leaders back home. This is a running commentary on the prevalent political conditions in India and a treatise for students of revolution. It is a burning story of all Tapasvis who were transported to Andaman.",,30th Edition,,1927,[],Paperback,"['Marathi', 'Biography', 'History', 'Autobiography']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351929842l/12646050.jpg,4.38,[],99.0,1.0,,12646050,,,,,95.0,1249.0,488,,Parchure Prakashan Mandir,"['738', '339', '111', '34', '27']",,,[],,

V.S. Naipaul,Half a Life,,English,,"In a narrative that moves with dreamlike swiftness from India to England to Africa, Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipaul has produced his finest novel to date, a bleakly resonant study of the fraudulent bargains that make up an identity.The son of a Brahmin ascetic and his lower-caste wife, Willie Chandran grows up sensing the hollowness at the core of his father's self-denial and vowing to live more authentically. That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray. Brilliantly orchestrated, at once elegiac and devastating in its portraits of colonial grandeur and pretension, Half a Life represents the pinnacle of Naipaul's career.",Willie Chandran #1,,10/30/01,April 23rd 2009,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Literature', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'Nobel Prize', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia']",,9780375707285,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320450717l/5853.jpg,3.25,['Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2001)'],98.0,1.0,,5853.Half_a_Life,,,,,80.0,3700.0,224,,Vintage International,"['394', '1046', '1506', '586', '168']",,,[],,
V.S. Naipaul,The Middle Passage,,English,,"In 1960 the government of Trinidad invited V. S. Naipaul to revisit his native country and record his impressions. In this classic of modern travel writing he has created a deft and remarkably prescient portrait of Trinidad and four adjacent Caribbean societies–countries haunted by the legacies of slavery and colonialism and so thoroughly defined by the norms of Empire that they can scarcely believe that the Empire is ending.In The Middle Passage, Naipaul watches a Trinidadian movie audience greeting Humphrey Bogart’s appearance with cries of “That is man!” He ventures into a Trinidad slum so insalubrious that the locals call it the Gaza Strip. He follows a racially charged election campaign in British Guiana (now Guyana) and marvels at the Gallic pretension of Martinique society, which maintains the fiction that its roads are extensions of France’s routes nationales. And throughout he relates the ghastly episodes of the region’s colonial past and shows how they continue to inform its language, politics, and values.

An Area of Darkness also abounds with Naipaul’s strikingly original responses to India’s paralyzing caste system, its apparently serene acceptance of poverty and squalor, and the conflict between its desire for self-determination and its nostalgia for the British raj.

Naipaul renders their lives (and the legends their neighbors construct around them) with Dickensian verve and Chekhovian compassion.Set during World War II and narrated by an unnamed-but precociously observant-neighborhood boy,  Miguel Street is a work of mercurial mood shifts, by turns sweetly melancholy and anarchically funny.

V.S. Ramachandran,A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbers,,English,,"How can some people come to believe that their poodle is an impostor? Or see colors in numbers? Internationally acclaimed neuroscientist, V.S. Ramachandran, now shares his unique insight into human consciousness in an entertaining, inspiring, and intellectually dazzling brief tour of the ultimate frontier—the thoughts in our heads.A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness is made up of five investigations of the greatest mysteries of the brain. The first chapter shows how amputees feel pain in limbs they no longer have as it introduces the great revolution of our age: neuroscience. The second chapter walks through the way what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing. The third chapter takes a leap beyond cutting edge science to audaciously set out a general theory of beauty, explaining why, the world over, cultures have fundamentally similar notions of what is attractive. The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S. Ramachandran one of the foremost brain researchers in the world today, sums up the implications of the revolution in our understanding of consciousness, to make a fascinating argument about our essential sense of self and its distributed nature.",,,December 4th 2003,July 26th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Philosophy', 'Brain', 'Popular Science', 'Medicine', 'Biology', 'Medical']",,9780131872783,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432093693l/31554._SY475_.jpg,4.01,[],5.0,1.0,,31554.A_Brief_Tour_of_Human_Consciousness,,,,,91.0,3516.0,208,,Plume,"['1411', '1124', '682', '212', '87']",,,[],,
"V.S. Ramachandran, Sandra Blakeslee, Oliver Sacks (Foreword)",Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind,,English,,"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases:A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial.A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious experience?A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the ""big questions"" about consciousness and the self.",,,08/19/98,August 18th 1999,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Brain', 'Medical', 'Biology', 'Philosophy', 'Popular Science']",,9780688172176,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409601908l/31555.jpg,4.26,[],90.0,1.0,,31555.Phantoms_in_the_Brain,,,,,95.0,16908.0,352,,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['8400', '5502', '2233', '525', '248']",,,[],,

Ma in questo romanzo le atrocità della guerra e l'eroismo di ogni soldato, il fasto e le crudeli bizzarrie della corte persiana, le insidie di una natura selvaggia e le amicizie più indissolubili sono narrate in una prospettiva completamente inedita: dalla voce di una donna, la bellissima siriana Abira, che per amore di Xenos lascia ogni cosa e condivide il destino dei Diecimila.

Valerio Massimo Manfredi,Il giuramento,,Italian,,"Ulisse, Odysseo, Nessuno: l'uomo dal multiforme ingegno, il mito che solca i mari, l'eroe più formidabile e moderno di tutti i tempi è qui, in queste pagine. E ci parla in prima persona, raccontandosi con tutta l'umanità e il coraggio che lo hanno reso, lungo ventisette secoli, più immortale di un dio.Dalla nascita nella piccola, rocciosa Itaca alla formazione di uomo e di guerriero al fianco del padre Laerte, dalle braccia materne della nutrice Euriclea al vasto mare da navigare sino a Sparta, dalla abbagliante e pericolosa bellezza di Elena all'amore per Penelope, dal solenne giuramento tra giovani principi leali al divampare della tremenda discordia: questo romanzo, primo di due volumi, segue Odysseo fino alla resa di Troia, grandiosa e terribile. Prima ancora che inizi il nòstos - lo straordinario viaggio di ritorno - l'avventura già è costellata di incontri folgoranti, segnata da crisi profonde, dominata dall'intelligenza e dall'ardimento di un uomo capace, passo dopo passo, di farsi eroe.La figura di Odysseo ha avuto lo straordinario destino di ""reincarnarsi"" infinite volte: i più grandi poeti lo hanno cantato, la sua orma profonda e sempre nuova è riconoscibile nei testi più importanti della letteratura di ogni tempo, a ogni latitudine. Tutti noi abbiamo la sensazione di ricordare da sempre le gesta di Odysseo, ma in questo romanzo, attingendo all'immensa messe di miti che lo vedono protagonista, Valerio Massimo Manfredi porta alla luce episodi e personaggi che non conoscevamo, ci regala la viva emozione di scoprire un intero universo brulicante di uomini, donne, imprese gloriose o sventurate. Ci mostra come accanto a quel personaggio fluisca gran parte dell'epos greco: Alcesti, le fatiche di Herakles, i sette contro Tebe, gli Argonauti, oltre ai due poemi di Omero. Odysseo non si erge solitario tra le ombre di dei e guerrieri, ma il suo intero percorso di formazione, le sue radici familiari, gli epici racconti di cui è nutrito dal nonno- lupo Autolykos e dal padre argonauta, i dialoghi con Herakles e Áias, gli incontri con la misteriosa Athena dagli occhi verdi, ogni dettaglio dà corpo a un racconto profondamente sorprendente.Con assoluto rigore ma anche con una vibrante adesione a questa materia ""in continuo movimento"", Manfredi compie la scelta forte di affidare la narrazione proprio a colui che disse di chiamarsi Nessuno: una voce diretta, potente, scolpita nella sua semplicità.Una voce dal fascino assoluto, una storia incalzante come i tamburi di guerra, tempestosa come il mare scatenato da Poseidone, piena di poesia come il canto delle Sirene.",Il mio nome è Nessuno #1,Omnibus,,November 6th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Greece', 'Historical Romance', 'War', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature']",,9788804622871,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352288560l/16134609.jpg,4.06,[],83.0,1.0,,16134609-il-giuramento,,,,,95.0,1668.0,360,,Mondadori,"['588', '694', '303', '64', '19']",,,[],,

Vanessa Place,La Medusa,,English,,"La Medusa is a polyphonic novel of post-conceptual consciousness. At the heart of the whole floats Medusa, an androgynous central awareness that anchors the novel throughout. La Medusa is at once the city of Los Angeles, with its snaking freeways and serpentine shifts between reality and illusion, and a brain—a modern mind that is both expansive and penetrating in its obsessions and perceptions.Vanessa Place’s characters—a trucker and his wife, a nine-year-old saxophonist, an ice cream vendor, a sex worker, and a corpse, among others—are borderless selves in a borderless city, a city impossible to contain. Her expert ventriloquism and explosive imagination anchor this epic narrative in language that is fierce and vibrant, a penetrating cross-section of contemporary Los Angeles and a cross-section of the modern mind.""Is the brain all these little movies, one synapsing into the next? Or I mean is culture that? Who are all those people on the freeway next to me, or dying in the blink of an eye when I forget about them. Vanessa Place's La Medusa is a novel of a million (I am sure there is a more precise count) brilliant suggestions about the mind and time and us. What seems impossible is that she is pulling ""it"" off in this impressive tome that moves like traffic when you have gotten it impossibly incredibly light. No wrong moves here. We get home fast."" —Eileen Myles ""Dazzling and daze-inducing, Vanessa Place dares to ask the dangerous question: What happened to Modernism? Why did what was ambitious, difficult, serious and experimental in Joyce, Eliot, Pound, Stein, and Beckett give way to a glittering string of infinite jests - high-wire acts, virtuosity, transcendental Camp? La Medusa returns to James Joyce's Ulysees to find the inspiration for an investigation into the nature of experience. Los Angeles takes the role of Dublin. The brain and its double cortex generate the stylistic intricacies that the organs and senses do in Joyce. And this is above all a Female Epic in which the swirling city-universe is explored and shaped by the petrifying eye and intellect of the wily Medusa, her coiling locks extending everywhere. "" —Michael Silverblatt, Bookworm, KCRW Public Radio""La Medusa, Vanessa Place's monumental polyvalent, polyglot epic novel of Los Angeles in which the postmodern morphs into random-access postcontemporary, in which the device of the narrative text in film script form has replaced that of the epistolary novel, is like a shocking rock slide of polished stones of the first water, cut by master jeweler, faceted into ten thousand-and-one sides — and the whole spill run in relative slow motion with no drag, no yawns, all be-bop, hip-hop Now. And sardonic: it zaps, out Fante-ing Fante and out-Rechy-ing Rechy. Looked at metaphorically in terms of motion pictures, Medusa is an epic silent, as long as Von Stroheim's Greed and every bit as cumulatively powerful. But one thing is certain: no matter how good the picture may turn out to be, the book will definitely have been better."" —James McCourt",,,,August 10th 2008,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'International Literature', 'American', 'Poetry', '21st Century']",,9781573661454,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328748616l/4413184.jpg,4.06,[],114.0,2.0,,4413184-la-medusa,,,,,88.0,84.0,488,,Fiction Collective 2,"['41', '19', '14', '8', '2']",,,[],,

It is not the first, and will not be the last.Reactions to the attacks are polarized. Police activity intensifies. Della’s revolutionary parents welcome the upheaval but are trapped within their own insular beliefs. Her activist restaurant co-workers, who would rather change their identities than the world around them, resume a shallow rebellion of hair-dye, sex parties, and self-absorption. As those bombs keep inching closer, thudding deep and real between the sounds of katydids fluttering in the still of the city night, and the destruction begins to excite her. What begins as terror threats called in to greasy bro-bars across the block boils over into a desperate plot, intoxicating and captivating Della and leaving her little chance for escape.Zazen unfolds as a search for clarity soured by irresolution and catastrophe, yet made vital by the thin, wild veins of imagination run through each escalating moment, tensing and relaxing, unfurling and ensnaring.

Vanessa Woods (Goodreads Author),Bonobo Handshake: A Memoir of Love and Adventure in the Congo,,English,,"A young woman follows her fiancé to war-torn Congo to study extremely endangered bonobo apes - who teach her a new truth about love and belonging.In 2005, Vanessa Woods accepted a marriage proposal from a man she barely knew and agreed to join him on a research trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country reeling from a brutal decade-long war that had claimed the lives of millions. Settling in at a bonobo sanctuary in Congo's capital, Vanessa and her fiancé entered the world of a rare ape with whom we share 98.7 percent of our DNA. She soon discovered that many of the inhabitants of the sanctuary - ape and human alike - are refugees from unspeakable violence, yet bonobos live in a peaceful society in which females are in charge, war is nonexistent, and sex is as common and friendly as a handshake.

For his lovers, it's Xavier's ravenous appetite for all things carnal—for the taste of flesh under his tongue and the feel of a trembling body under his control, for whispered pleas and muffled cries—that makes him dangerous.But recently, driven by a festering rage against the men who attacked his sister a decade ago, Xavier has developed a taste for a different kind of hunt and conquest: stalking men who do truly bad things and punishing the predators he sniffs out. The problem with vigilante justice, though, is sometimes the man in your trap is innocent.Carson suspects he's playing a risky game with dangerous men. But the lies are convincing, especially when they're slipped to him among hundred dollar bills. He never guessed how big and dark the secret hidden under all the lies and money could be.

"Vasily Grossman, Antony Beevor (Editor), Luba Vinogradova (Translator)",A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army,,English,,"Edited and translated from the Russian by Antony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova Knopf Canada is proud to present a masterpiece of the Second World War, never before published in English, from one of the great Russian writers of the 20th century – a vivid eyewitness account of the Eastern Front and “the ruthless truth of war.”When the Germans invaded Russia in 1941, Vasily Grossman became a special correspondent for the Red Star, the Red Army’s newspaper. A Writer at War – based on the notebooks in which Grossman gathered raw material for his articles – depicts the crushing conditions on the Eastern Front, and the lives and deaths of soldiers and civilians alike. It also includes some of the earliest reportage on the Holocaust. In the three years he spent on assignment, Grossman witnessed some of the most savage fighting of the war: the appalling defeats of the Red Army, the brutal street fighting in Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk (the largest tank engagement in history), the defense of Moscow, the battles in Ukraine, and much more.Historian Antony Beevor has taken Grossman’s raw notebooks, and fashioned them into a narrative providing one of the most even-handed descriptions – at once unflinching and sensitive – we have ever had of what he called “the ruthless truth of war.”From the Hardcover edition.",,,09/01/05,March 13th 2007,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Russia', 'World War II', 'War', 'Biography', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History', 'Memoir', 'Russian History']",,9780676978117,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320453566l/267013.jpg,4.15,[],182.0,2.0,,267013.A_Writer_at_War,,,,,95.0,2818.0,380,,Vintage Canada,"['1225', '1009', '432', '99', '53']",,,['Soviet Union'],,

Veena Gavankar,एक होता कार्व्हर,,Marathi,,"Published more than 30 years ago, Veena Gavankar’s biography of African-American scientist and agriculturist George Washington Carver, has remained one of the bestsellers in Marathi literature even today.A gripping story about a man and his determination to succeed amidst hardship and hurdles, the book not only captures the essence of perseverance, but also beautifully portrays how the desire and a thirst for knowledge indeed, does lead to greatness.Dubbed by the Times magazine in 1941 as the “Black Leonardo”, Carver’s contributions to the fields of botany and agriculture are immense. His courage and conviction, to get an education in spite of growing up in a society ridden with prejudice and reeking with the aftermath of the apartheid, is astutely covered by the author.Short, simple and neatly written, Gavankar has touched every aspect of the life and struggles of Carver, his achievements and his many talents. Known as the Peanut Man in America and all around the world today, Carver is said to be the man behind the development of the quintessential American spread, the peanut butter. His message - about persevering in the face of adversity and making something out of whatever one has in life - is simply but clearly depicted, and this biography has served as an inspiration to hundreds of Indians all over the country.Ek Hota Carver, which began as a result of a mother’s search for bedtime stories for her children, has been on the best-selling Marathi literature for over 30 years, from the time it was first published. Soon to be available as an audiobook, Ek Hota Carver has also had the distinction of being run into 34 editions.",,Deluxe edition,10/30/81,2001,[],Paperback,"['Marathi', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Inspirational']",,9788174340474,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378314986l/11253505.jpg,4.21,[],98.0,1.0,,11253505,,,,,94.0,2839.0,184,,Rajhans Prakashan,"['1388', '918', '351', '101', '81']",,,[],,

After five hundred years of recreation civilization is split into four colonies: those that live on the ground call their colony ‘Damiroo‘; those who live in underwater cities call their colony ‘Retarctica‘; those who live in floating cities that hover above the clouds call their colony ‘Anotresphor‘; and those who live in space cities following the same orbit as the moon around the earth call their colony ‘Centralis‘.“Quantos Rising“, the first book in the series, follows the story of a former researcher Bruce in his attempts to save his city, El-Versium from the tyranny of the Damiroo military.Tragedy strikes in a remote city called El-Versium which becomes the war zone between the Damiroo colony’s military and their project gone wrong, Lunar-Mount—a threat detecting droid that destroys any potential source of danger with the highest threat levels relative to any around it.Now it’s up to Bruce, a former researcher from the University of APEX’s Research Facility in the city, New Middle, to shut down the droid before it destroys his home city, El-Versium with the aid of the Damiroo military who also became victims of the robot’s malfunctioning.Accompanying him are Damien, a former Scientologist from the very same University facility, and Emilia, an intern at the El-Versium medical center.The FTP source coding stream was wiped out from the robot’s programming so the trio has to dive right into the robot’s system via Neuro-Surge injection: a technology designed by both Damien and Bruce which allows for the human subconscious to be plugged right into the heart of any computer systems which generates computer functionality in a real world representation. The trio must dive into the system and program the kill switch directly into the robot’s system.Little do they know that this is yet just an cover-up operation to use the trio to further the military’s project-QR; resurfacing a long since sunken city from before the times of the war which allegedly harbored civilization’s largest King Solomon’s Library and the T-16 weapons vault.The race is on!",,Large Print,,December 9th 2015,[],ebook,[],,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1449875486l/28175937._SX318_.jpg,4.8,[],200.0,2.0,,28175937-quantos-rising,,,,,100.0,10.0,85,,Ven G Books,"['8', '2', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,

"Veniamin Kaverin, Bernard Isaacs (Translator)",Two Captains,,English,,"Two Captains is the most renowned novel of the Russian writer Veniamin Kaverin. The plot spans from 1912 to 1944. For more than half a century the book has been loved by children and adults alike. The novel has undergone more than 100 printings, including translations into other languages. Based on its story, plays have been staged and an opera has been written. The plot of the book also became the basis of two movies of the same title in 1955 and 1976. In 1995 in Pskov, the home town of the author, a monument was erected to the characters of the book and a ""Two Captains"" museum was opened.The real prototype for Captain Tatarinov was Lieutenant Georgii Brusilov, who in 1912 organized a privately funded expedition seeking a west-to-east Northern sea route. The steamship ""St. Anna,"" specially built for the expedition, left Petersburg on 28 July 1912. Near the shores of Yamal peninsula it was seized by ice and carried in the ice drift to the north of the Kara Sea. The expedition survived two hard winters. Of the 14 people who left the stranded steamship in 1914, only two made it to one of the islands of Frants-Joseph Land and were spotted and taken aboard ""St. Foka,"" the ship of the expedition of G. Y. Sedov. The ship log they had kept with them contained the most important of the scientific data, after the study of which Sedov's expedition found the previously unknown island in the Kara Sea, Vize Island. The ultimate fate of ""St.Anna"" and its remaining crew is still unknown. Veniamin Kaverin (1902-1989) wrote novels, short stories, fairy tales, memoirs, and biographies. In the early 1920s, Veniamin Kaverin was a member of experimental literary group ""Serapionovi bratya.""

Vera John-Steiner,Notebooks of the Mind,Explorations of Thinking,,Psychology,"How do creative people think? Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of ""experienced thinkers""--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin's preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous ""bag of memories"" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.",,,,1997.0,,,,0195108965,9780195108965,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uj1RDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.81,,,,,,,,,,,,288.0,,,,17.0,,,,

Recheado de flash-backs para o passado e para o futuro (!), a antevisão, real e com todos os detalhes, da degradação da sua velhice e do seu funeral urge em Paulo a derradeira tentativa de procura da explicação de um sentido para a vida, alimentada por muitos sonhos e esperanças no tempo em que tal era devido, cheia de frustrações e desilusões posteriores frutos de um destino azarado e de uma fatalidade previsível, condições propícias para um redescobrir da vida nos elementos mais simples que anteriormente passavam despercebidos na azáfama do cumprimento do quotidiano e de toda uma vida alicerçada nos seus valores supostamente mais altos.Nesta narrativa de evocações aleatórias, centrada no romance de Paulo com Sandra, mulher difícil e de poucos sentimentalismos, a redução de uma vida ao seu cumprimento basilar pelo amor, último alicerce num mundo de ilusões, revelando-se semítico na sua realização, e defraudado ainda por uma filha que o confronta com a esterilidade da sua actividade e do seu pensamento, mumificando-o no seu tempo presente, tempo esse prometedor de progressos civilizacionais que os próprios contemporâneos se encarregam de deitar a perder, ébrios de uma liberdade utópica que nada concilia face à disparidade de vertentes, facções e pontos de vista que num ruído ensurdecedor emudece e paralisa a humanidade no êxtase do extremo da civilização actual.Vítima do seu próprio pensamento perscrutador, questionando a sua condição humana e a dos outros, comparando-a até ao fim dos tempos, um lamento arrastado mas pontuado por algumas fagulhas de lucidez e outras de felicidade passada e presente, num acomodar inconsciente contrastante de uma luta ávida pela vida onde persistem ainda mais perguntas que respostas apesar de toda a sofreguidão de viver tal como evidenciado pelo relato de vida do narrador. A paz nunca chega, para sempre continua a percepção do abismo entre aquilo que se é e aquilo que se sente.Paulo Neves da Silva,Oeiras, Portugal",,,10/30/83,1994,[],Paperback,"['Portugal', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1264728127l/7657773.jpg,4.26,[],98.0,1.0,,7657773-para-sempre,,,,,97.0,407.0,306,,Bertrand Editora,"['192', '144', '57', '11', '3']",,,[],,

Vesa Turpeinen (Goodreads Author),LEARN TO FLY AND BECOME A PILOT!: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE FOR DETERMINING YOUR CAPABILITIES OF BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL PILOT AND GETTING STARTED WITH FLIGHT TRAINING (The Pilot Career Series # 1),,English,,"You Can Become a Pilot! Learning to Fly is Easier than You Think! Have you always dreamed of becoming a pilot?Are you wondering if now is a good time to become a pilot?Do you want to get started with flight training, but need help choosing a school?All your questions will be answered in this book! This book may be the most important book you will ever read if you want to become a professional pilot…But first a warning, this is not a book about “learning to fly” in a literal sense. You won't learn how aerodynamics work or how to control an aircraft in flight – that's something you will learn once you start your flight training. Instead, this book contains information that flight schools won’t teach you. The information you NEED to know before you should commit to flight training!The knowledge you gain from this book is essential for you to have a successful and enjoyable career as a commercial or airline pilot! The main focus of the book is on FAA and EASA flight training in the U.S., but most of the principles apply regardless of your nationality.Whether you want to earn your private pilot certificate, become a corporate pilot, or become a captain in a major airline – this book is for you. And one note to the ladies – it is now the golden age for female pilots!Did you know you could become a commercial pilot, or even a flight instructor, at the age of 18 with less than 12 months of training? Right now is an excellent time to become a pilot because there is a global pilot shortage that is expected to last for the next two decades or longer. Boeing estimates that there will be a worldwide demand for 790,000 pilots between 2018 and 2037. That’s a lot of pilots! How do I know the pilot shortage is not just a myth?Currently, most airlines in China are hiring airline captains from foreign countries because there are not enough Chinese pilots. And what’s the pay like? Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 captains can earn an annual salary up to $380,000! That’s over 30k per month! …and, wait for it—it’s all tax-free (in China)! Yes, it will be a long road to become an airline captain earning a good salary. But guess what? Reading this book will help you decide if you want to pursue the career.Who is this Author?With Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Vesa knows a thing or two about aviation. With several years as a flight instructor, assistant chief flight instructor, and ultimately as the Chief Flight Instructor of a major flight academy, he is an expert in pilot training. Having trained hundreds of pilots who currently work for many airlines (including many Chinese airlines), he has the first-hand knowledge of the demand for new pilots. Because of his experience as a corporate airline captain, he understands the benefits and downsides of pilot life and can help you decide whether it’s a good career path for you!Flight training is fast-paced, fun, and exciting. Why not get started now?Here are some of the questions this book will answer:How much does flight training cost?How can I finance flight training without any savings or income?What are the benefits and downsides of a pilot career?What kind of certificates and ratings do I need to start working as a professional pilot?How to choose the best flight school (and flight instructor) based on my individual needs?",,,,April 10th 2019,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B07QJBLCPG,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1555420545l/45034602._SY475_.jpg,4.65,[],98.0,1.0,,45034602-learn-to-fly-and-become-a-pilot,,,,,100.0,23.0,167,,,"['17', '4', '2', '0', '0']",,,[],,

"Vicki Myron, Bret Witter (Contributor)",Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World,,English,,"How much of an impact can an animal have? How many lives can one cat touch? How is it possible for an abandoned kitten to transform a small library, save a classic American town, and eventually become famous around the world? You can't even begin to answer those questions until you hear the charming story of Dewey Readmore Books, the beloved library cat of Spencer, Iowa.Dewey's story starts in the worst possible way. Only a few weeks old, on the coldest night of the year, he was stuffed into the returned book slot at the Spencer Public Library. He was found the next working by library director Vicki Myron, a single mother who had survived the loss of her family farm, a breast cancer scare, and an alcoholic husband. Dewey won her heart, and the hearts of the staff, by pulling himself up and hobbling on frostbitten feet to nudge each of hem in a gesture of thanks and love. For the next nineteen years, he never stopped charming the people of Spencer with this enthusiasm, warmth, humility (for a cat), and, above all, his sixth sense about who needed him most.As his fame grew from town to town, then state to state, and finally, amazingly, worldwide, Dewey became more than just a friend; he became a source of pride for an extraordinary Heartland farming town pulling its way slowly back from the greatest crisis in its long history.",Dewey Readmore,,,September 24th 2008,"['Dewey Readmore Books', 'Vicky Myron', 'Jodie Myron']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Cats', 'Biography', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'Books About Books', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary']",,9780446407410,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398144610l/3257136.jpg,3.87,[],852.0,11.0,,3257136-dewey,,,,,90.0,51543.0,277,,Grand Central Publishing,"['17299', '16646', '12575', '3791', '1232']",,,"['Spencer, Iowa (United States)', 'Iowa (United States)']",,
Vicki Pettersson (Goodreads Author),The Scent of Shadows,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewVegas showgirl-turned-novelist Vicki Pettersson's debut novel is sure to be an instant hit with readers who enjoy authors like Laurell K. Hamilton, Kim Harrison,and Charlaine Harris. Blending dark fantasy and hard-boiled mystery with elements of romance and apocalyptic thriller, The Scent of Shadows -- the first installment of the Signs of the Zodiac saga -- is set amid the neon-lit glitziness of Sin City and features Joanna Archer, one of the most intriguing and unfathomably deep heroines to grace the pages of a supernatural fantasy in ages. Sexually assaulted when she was a teenager, Archer has grown into a woman marked by contradictions; she's one of the richest heiresses on the planet but she spends all of her free time roaming the back alleys of Vegas at night, photographing the city's forgotten -- the homeless, drug addicts, runaways, et al. The camera is a shield of sorts for Archer, who enjoys seeing the gaudy world around her in stark black-and-white. This dichotomy takes on new meaning when her egomaniacal dad informs her that he is not her biological father and promptly disinherits her. When her sister Olivia is brutally murdered shortly thereafter by a supernatural assassin, Joanna's world is turned upside down, and she is thrust into the middle of an ongoing spiritual war between Light and Shadow. Following in her wayward mother's footsteps, Joanna becomes the Archer, a crime-fighting member of a much-depleted troop whose mission it is to defeat their astrological opposites, the Shadow Zodiac. But Joanna is much more than she seems; and if she can survive long enough to unravel the mystery surrounding her lineage, she just might be able to shed some much needed Light into the growing darkness . The Scent of Shadows succeeds in large part for two reasons: Pettersson's masterful ability to create realistic and emotionally compelling characters and her witty and caustic narrative voice make for not only a darkly humorous but also wildly entertaining reading experience.

Vicky Beeching,"Undivided: Coming Out, Becoming Whole, and Living Free from Shame",,English,,"Vicky Beeching, called “arguably the most influential Christian of her generation” in The Guardian, began writing songs for the church in her teens. By the time she reached her early thirties, Vicky was a household name in churches on both sides of the pond. Recording multiple albums and singing in America’s largest megachurches, her music was used weekly around the globe and translated into numerous languages.But this poster girl for evangelical Christianity lived with a debilitating inner battle: she was gay. The tens of thousands of traditional Christians she sang in front of were unanimous in their view—they staunchly opposed same-sex relationships and saw homosexuality as a grievous sin. Vicky knew if she ever spoke up about her identity, it would cost her everything.Faced with a major health crisis, at the age of thirty-five she decided to tell the world that she was gay. As a result, all hell broke loose. She lost her music career and livelihood, faced threats and vitriol from traditionalists, developed further health issues from the immense stress, and had to rebuild her life almost from scratch.But despite losing so much she gained far more: she was finally able to live from a place of wholeness, vulnerability, and authenticity.

Victor Canning,The Crimson Chalice,,English,,"Another reworking of the Arthurian legend, but so bereft of Arthurian resonance that it might have worked better as an unvarnished or unvarnished historical novel of the Roman twilight in Britain. As the Saxon pillagers sweep ever farther west, young Baradoc, Roman army veteran & son of a British tribal chief, meets Tia, a Roman girl fleeing the troubles. Their son Arturo, a child hugely endowed with wildness, blarney & arrogance, grows up to inherit his father's dream of uniting Britain against the Saxons. The story is chiefly concerned with the slow building of his campaign, from his early rebellion against the delaying tactics of the anti-Saxon forces to the great victory of Mt Badon. Like many imaginers of an earlier Britain, Canning is best when describing the wild countryside & the homely skills of its inhabitants. His attempts to graft this material onto the Grail legend are effortful platitudes. Merlin appears & disappears at climactic moments, saying things like ""Only the gods know that."" Speeches are peppered with ritual interjections of ""Aie..."" to indicate deep thought. People look at each other & instinctively know something, or undergo some tremendous change ""from that moment""...Canning's Arturo does occasionally come to life during his stormy childhood in the Tribe of the Enduring Crow; once he is grown, one feels that Canning, like Sir Bedivere, has lost sight of the barge.--Kirkus Beginning note: ""At the time of this story—roughly 450 AD—any effective Roman presence in Britain had long gone. The shadow of the Dark Ages—which were to last nearly 300 years—had already fallen across the country. The Saxon mercenaries, hired originally to fight against the Pictish invasions from the North, were now breaking out of the lands granted to them in the East. Constantly reinforced by more of their kind they were beginning to sweep westwards across the country, massacring & pillaging, to make it their own.""  Postscript: ""Although there are no incontrovertible facts about King Arthur, the renown of his life & deeds in the Dark Ages was lodged for over 600 years in folk memory. & folk, being what they are, invariably alter & embroider a good story. Wm of Malmesbury, Geoffrey of Monmouth & then Sir Thomas Malory were landed with the result. Lesser as well as better writers have followed them. Acknowledging that I come in the first of these two categories, I feel no shame in entering the lists poorly armed but securely mounted on a horse I have ridden for years called Imagination.""",The Crimson Chalice trilogy #1,,11/06/76,August 1979,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Arthurian', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical']",,9780441121908,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1283974440l/1488965.jpg,3.79,[],86.0,1.0,,1488965.The_Crimson_Chalice,,,,,92.0,111.0,550,,Ace Books,"['34', '33', '35', '5', '4']",,,[],,

Victor Gischler,Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse,,English,,"Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world. Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an America that no longer exists. The highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. What little civilization remains revolves around Joey Armageddon's Sassy A-Go-Go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with M16s.

Victor Hugo,Les Contemplations,,French,,"Hugo écrit Les Contemplations en 1856 alors qu'il vit un exil politique (thème qu'il abordera dans Les Châtiments). Il vit aussi depuis plusieurs années un exil intérieur qui hante Les Contemplations. Composées de deux parties distinctes, ""Autrefois"" et ""Aujourd'hui"", Les Contemplations est la première œuvre poétique maîtresse d'Hugo, plus de dix mille signes jetés à la face de la mer et du ciel sur l'île de Jersey. Marqué à tout jamais par la mort de sa fille Léopoldine, Hugo annonce dans sa préface qu'on ne peut réconcilier ces deux parties : ""un abîme les sépare, le tombeau"". Les plus beaux poèmes d'Hugo sur la force de la nature, la nostalgie de l'enfance et la fatalité de la mort se trouvent dans Les Contemplations. Ils sont indépassables. Dans cette œuvre en vers, Hugo joue d'une variété de rythme et de ton assez incroyable. Classique par moment, romantique, sage parfois, vénérant ses maîtres Gautier, Le Conte de L'Isle ou Banville, romantique déchaîné souvent comme dans ""Réponse à un acte d'accusation"" – poème que l'on peut considérer comme la profession de foi romantique d'Hugo – partout et tout le temps, Hugo réinvente l'acte de création poétique. Ce que dit ""La bouche d'ombre"", poème de huit cents vers, nous fait atteindre un degré supérieur dans l'ordre de la vision poétique. Le verbe d'Hugo se transforme en traité cosmogo-théologico-moral. ""Dieu dictait, j'écrivais"", constate logiquement Hugo à la fin du recueil. Aujourd'hui encore, après que Rimbaud, en lisant Les Contemplations, l'a considéré comme ""le premier des voyants"", que les surréalistes l'ont intronisé maître, Hugo continue d'impressionner par l'envergure de son génie protéiforme. --Denis Gombert",,,10/28/56,,[],,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'France', 'French Literature', 'School', 'Fiction', '19th Century', 'Read For School', 'Literature', 'Adult']",,9782080708434,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172069212l/135617.jpg,4.1,[],256.0,3.0,,135617.Les_Contemplations,,,,,94.0,2071.0,471,,,"['860', '713', '367', '99', '32']",,,[],,

Despite his renown, however, there are few comprehensive collections of his verse available and even fewer translated editions.Translators E. H. and A. M. Blackmore have collected Victor Hugo's essential verse into a single, bilingual volume that showcases all the facets of Hugo's oeuvre, including intimate love poems, satires against the political establishment, serene meditations, religious verse, and narrative poems illustrating his mastery of the art of storytelling and his abiding concern for the social issues of his time. More than half of this volume's eight thousand lines of verse appear here for the first time in English, providing readers with a new perspective on each of the fascinating periods of Hugo's career and aspects of his style. Introductions to each section guide the reader through the stages of Hugo's writing, while notes on individual poems provide information not found in even the most detailed French-language editions.Illustrated with Hugo's own paintings and drawings, this lucid translation—available on the eve of Hugo's bicentenary—pays homage to this towering figure of nineteenth-century literature by capturing the energy of his poetry, the drama and satirical force of his language, and the visionary beauty of his writing as a whole.",,,January 1st 1949,June 1st 2004,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Reference', 'Fiction', 'European Literature', 'Literature']",,9780226359816,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328873542l/108347.jpg,4.15,['ALTA National Translation Award (2002)'],8.0,1.0,,108347.Selected_Poems_of_Victor_Hugo,,,,,96.0,281.0,664,,University of Chicago Press,"['116', '106', '47', '10', '2']",,,[],,

Victor J. Stenger,Physics and Psychics,,English,,"The astonishing discoveries made by modern physics - imploding black holes, ghost-like quarks, and the odd rules governing quantum mechanics - have transformed our image of the physical world. A growing number of writers assert that such discoveries also demonstrate the existence of a nonphysical, spiritual world, a world that permits a wide variety of paranormal and psychic phenomena.What exactly has physics shown us? Is there a world that transcends the sphere of the senses? Millions throughout history have thought so, but the existence of such a world is still accepted on faith alone. The tools of science have revealed no proof of spirits, ghosts, or supernatural phenomena.Physics and Psychics critically examines theories of a transcendent reality in terms of all that is currently known about matter at its most fundamental level. Victor J. Stenger gives a provocative, often amusing history of psychic research and occult beliefs, offering a convincing rebuttal to those who attempt to link physics to mystical truths. Stenger examines a number of well-known paranormal claims and shows how they can be explained without resorting to supernatural or psychic hypotheses. Discussing quantum theory and relativity, he demonstrates that these concepts actually invalidate paranormal claims and that there is no scientific basis for a universe other than one composed of observable matter.The human species has always lived under the assumption that supernatural forces determine destiny. Can our lives retain meaning when this assumption seems unfounded? Writes Stenger: ""The supernatural has been a yoke on the neck of humanity since we first began to think and dream. The tools of science provide the wherewithal to be guided not by 'a world beyond the senses' but by the power of the intellect; hence, they have given us 'freedom to live and act according to the fullest knowledge about the world'.""

Victor J. Stenger,God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist,,English,,"Throughout history, arguments for and against the existence of God have been largely confined to philosophy and theology. In the meantime, science has sat on the sidelines and quietly watched this game of words march up and down the field. Despite the fact that science has revolutionized every aspect of human life and greatly clarified our understanding of the world, somehow the notion has arisen that it has nothing to say about the possibility of a supreme being, which much of humanity worships as the source of all reality. Physicist Victor J. Stenger contends that, if God exists, some evidence for this existence should be detectable by scientific means, especially considering the central role that God is alleged to play in the operation of the universe and the lives of humans. Treating the traditional God concept, as conventionally presented in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, like any other scientific hypothesis, Stenger examines all of the claims made for God's existence. He considers the latest Intelligent Design arguments as evidence of God's influence in biology. He looks at human behavior for evidence of immaterial souls and the possible effects of prayer. He discusses the findings of physics and astronomy in weighing the suggestions that the universe is the work of a creator and that humans are God's special creation. After evaluating all the scientific evidence, Stenger concludes that beyond a reasonable doubt the universe and life appear exactly as we might expect if there were no God.",,,10/30/07,January 2nd 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Physics', 'Skepticism', 'Spirituality', 'God', 'Reference']",,9781591024811,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463550l/98810.jpg,3.93,[],114.0,2.0,,98810.God,,,,,90.0,7870.0,294,,Prometheus Books,"['3050', '2355', '1648', '485', '332']",,,[],,
Victor J. Stenger,"Fallacy of Fine-Tuning, The: Why the Universe Is Not Designed for Us",,English,,"A number of authors have noted that if some physical parameters were slightly changed, the universe could no longer support life, as we know it. This implies that life depends sensitively on the physics of our universe. Does this “fine-tuning” of the universe also suggest that a creator god intentionally calibrated the initial conditions of the universe such that life on earth and the evolution of humanity would eventually emerge? Some influential scientists, such as National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, think so. Others go even further, asserting that science “has found God.” In this in-depth, lucid discussion of this fascinating and controversial topic, physicist Victor J. Stenger looks at the same evidence and comes to the opposite conclusion. He states at the outset that as a physicist he will go wherever the data takes him, even if it leads him to God. But after many years of research in particle physics and thinking about its implications, he finds that the observations of science and our naked senses not only show no evidence for God, they provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that God does not exist. Stenger argues that many of the claims by theists are based on their misunderstanding of the science. He looks at the specific parameters and shows that plausible reasons can be found for the values they have within the existing standard models of physics and cosmology. These models are introduced in detail so that the reader has the background needed to understand the role of the parameters claimed to be fine-tuned and judge the veracity of the arguments. He also discusses related issues such as whether or not the universe had a beginning, what quantum mechanics implies about the involvement of human consciousness in affecting reality, and whether evidence can be found in nature for a divine plan. Although Stenger has touched on the subject of fine-tuning in other books, this is his most thorough exploration of a topic that continues to intrigue scientists and the lay public alike.Victor J. Stenger (Lafayette, CO) is adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado and emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii. He is the author of the New York Times bestseller God: The Failed Hypothesis, and many other books, including The New Atheism, Quantum Gods, The Unconscious Quantum, Has Science Found God?, The Comprehensible Cosmos, Timeless Reality, and Physics and Psychics.",,,January 1st 2011,,"['Charles Darwin', 'David Hume', 'Richard Dawkins', 'Christopher Hitchens', 'Stephen Hawking', 'Daniel Dennett', 'Deepak Chopra', 'William Lane Craig', 'Alvin Plantinga', 'William A.

"Victor Klemperer, Martin Chalmers (Translator)",I Will Bear Witness 1933-41 A Diary of the Nazi Years,,English,,"The publication of Victor Klemperer's secret diaries brings to light one of the most extraordinary documents of the Nazi period. ""In its cool, lucid style and power of observation,"" said The New York Times, ""it is the best  written, most evocative, most observant record of daily life in the Third Reich."" I Will Bear Witness is a work of literature as well as a revelation of the day-by-day horror of the Nazi years.                           A Dresden Jew, a veteran of World War I, a man of letters and historian of great sophistication, Klemperer recognized the danger of Hitler as early as 1933. His diaries, written in secrecy, provide a vivid account of everyday life in Hitler's Germany.                          What makes this book so remarkable, aside from its literary distinction, is Klemperer's preoccupation with the thoughts and actions of ordinary Germans: Berger the greengrocer, who was given Klemperer's house (""anti-Hitlerist, but of course pleased at the good exchange""), the fishmonger, the baker, the much-visited dentist. All offer their thoughts and theories on the progress of the war: Will England hold out? Who listens to Goebbels? How much longer will it last?                          This symphony of voices is ordered by the brilliant, grumbling Klemperer, struggling to complete his work on eighteenth-century France while documenting the ever- tightening Nazi grip. He loses first his professorship and then his car, his phone, his house, even his typewriter, and is forced to move into a Jews' House (the last step before the camps), put his cat to death (Jews may not own pets), and suffer countless other indignities.                           Despite the danger his diaries would pose if discovered, Klemperer sees it as his duty to record events. ""I continue to write,"" he notes in 1941 after a terrifying run-in with the police. ""This is my heroics. I want to bear witness, precise witness, until the very end.""   When a neighbor remarks that, in his isolation, Klemperer will not be able to cover the main events of the war, he writes: ""It's not the big things that are important, but the everyday life of  tyranny, which may be forgotten. A thousand mosquito bites are worse than a blow on the head. I observe, I note, the mosquito bites.""                          This book covers the years from 1933 to 1941.

They're lured into vans and onto airplanes with promises of jobs as waitresses, models, nannies, dishwashers, maids, and dancers. But when they arrive at their destinations, they are stripped of their identification, and their nightmare begins.

They contain the condensed wisdom of years of soul-searching before Victor’s awakening, and years of compassionate attempts since, by him, to remind others of their own journey towards self-realisation. The messages are relevant to anyone who has ever pondered about existence and the possibilities of improving this life-experience, the only thing that truly belongs to us.The style of writing interweaves between storytelling, conversation and prose-poetry. The uniqueness of these expressions of timeless truths lies in the fact that throughout his spiritual search, and, the years following his awakening, Victor continues to remain in the chaos of an average urban life. And, for this reason, his messages act as a perfect bridge between the unworldly and worldly quests of human mind, giving immense hope to finding a life full of freedom, joy and love by remaining exactly where we are.---From back cover: Your journey didn't begin when you were born, or, even when you thought you have arrived; Your journey begins, when you stop, and look for new eyes, to see you. Your journey didn't begin, when you fulfilled your dreams; Your journey begins, when you reject dreams that you bought in your sleep. Your journey didn't begin, when you were told that you have made it; Your journey begins when you reject the notion 'what you have become, is the best you can be'.

People think that Alex was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, not only rich, but blessed by luck. Men respect him, women dream of him, and Alex alone knows the strength it takes to conceal his tortured soul and devastating secrets.But despite those powerful life lessons, he has always believed in his father’s words, ‘When you fall in love, you love forever - it’s in our family blood. Look for HER and you’ll find your happiness beyond thought…’Valeria has never experienced actual romance (an early pregnancy, a hasty marriage, a life filled with work and study) and considers herself a pragmatist. She was taught to live by the rules: if you get married, then you love your husband; if you dream of a new home, then you work hard. But when, against all logic, she finds a beautiful stranger in her bed, her world turns upside down. After all, falling for the forbidden can be too sweet not to try… at least once.They come from the opposite ends of the globe, but the collision of two soulmates is destined. Fate will send them on a lifelong journey from Eastern Europe to Spain, France, the United States, and back.Their story is a mix of a beautiful fairy tale and a painful nightmare. It`s not something you`ve heard before: everything is too vivid, too honest, too emotional and too profound.
  An attraction at first sight;

  A passion that breaks all rules;

  A hypnotic melody – it conquers all.

  This is one love for life and beyond time,

Vijay Mishra,The Literature of the Indian Diaspora: Theorizing the Diasporic Imaginary,,English,,"The Literature of the Indian Diaspora constitutes a major study of the literature and other cultural texts of the Indian diaspora. It is also an important contribution to diaspora theory in general. Examining both the 'old' Indian diaspora of early capitalism, following the abolition of slavery, and the 'new' diaspora linked to movements of late capital, Mishra argues that a full understanding of the Indian diaspora can only be achieved if attention is paid to the particular locations of both the 'old' and the 'new' in nation states.Applying a theoretical framework based on trauma, mourning/impossible mourning, spectres, identity, travel, translation, and recognition, Mishra uses the term 'imaginary' to refer to any ethnic enclave in a nation-state that defines itself, consciously or unconsciously, as a group in displacement. He examines the works of key writers, many now based across the globe in Canada, Australia, America and the UK, - V.S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, M.G.

In Bollywood Cinema, Vijay Mishra argues that Indian film production and reception is shaped by the desire for national community and a pan-Indian popular culture. Seeking to understand Bollywood according to its own narrative and aesthetic principles and in relation to a global film industry, he views Indian cinema through the dual methodologies of postcolonial studies and film theory. Mishra discusses classics such as Mother India (1957) and Devdas (1935) and recent films including Ram Lakhan (1989) and Khalnayak (1993), linking their form and content to broader issues of national identity, epic tradition, popular culture, history, and the implications of diaspora.",,,10/30/01,December 7th 2001,[],Paperback,['India'],,9780415930154,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347256632l/422463.jpg,3.76,[],98.0,1.0,,422463.Bollywood_Cinema,,,,,92.0,25.0,296,,Routledge,"['6', '10', '7', '1', '1']",,,[],,
Vijay Mishra,Devotional Poetics and the Indian Sublime,,,,"The last two decades of the twentieth century have been marked by an immense revival of interest in the sublime. The sublime has been periodized (and ""trans-periodized""), gendered, politicized, and even made into a commodity with specific social and economic effects. Yet past studies have used Western texts as their archives. This book dramatically shifts the focus by examining a major instance of a non-Western sublime: the Hindu Brahman. Devotional Poetics and the Indian Sublime examines European theories of the sublime, reads them off against contemporary critical uses of the term (notably by Lyotard and Paul de Man), and proposes that the Hindu Brahman constitutes an instance of one of the most fully developed of all sublimes. Mishra argues that the negative aesthetics of Brahman (and the largely decentered rhetoric of Hinduism generally) is part of this massive culture's use of the category of the sublime (and not the beautiful) to speak about a moment when the mind is confronted with an idea too large to be presented to consciousness. The book then examines the case of one of India's dominant literary genres--devotional verse--to show that once the category of the sublime is grasped (or seen as the undertheorized category of Indian aesthetics), it soon becomes clear that this massive genre is also predicated upon Brahman, the Absolute, as the sublime object of (impossible) desire. It is the first book to offer a comprehensive theory of both the Indian sublime and Indian devotional verse.",,,08/01/98,April 5th 1999,[],Paperback,['India'],,9788124601563,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266649191l/805843.jpg,3.5,[],100.0,1.0,,805843.Devotional_Poetics_and_the_Indian_Sublime,,,,,100.0,2.0,256,,"DK Print World Pvt.Ltd,India",[],,,[],,

As a member of the ashram, she lives a life of complete abstinence, but her young friend's innocent exuberance and joy of life fills her with renewed hope.The two form an unlikely bond, with Noor looking out for Choti, inspiring her to 'fly high' by seeking an education and fighting for her rights with dignity. Choti listens enraptured by the memories her friend shares: of playing Holi dressed as Radha, the consort of Lord Krishna, and flinging great bursts of her favorite pink-colored gulal into the sky. Choti promises her that they will play the next Holi together.But then, one night, another friend of Choti's, Anarkali, is murdered by the heinous police chief and his goons. Being the only witness to her murder, Choti is imprisoned on the eve of Holi.

It's a gorgeous autumn day in Georgetown. The Democratic candidates for president and vice president of the United States are dutifully glad-handing voters and the media outside a grand estate where a national security conference has just been held, bringing together the world's greatest minds to discuss the issues that are threatening the country. It's American politicking at its best. That's when all hell breaks loose.When presidential candidate Josh Alexander's motorcade is ambushed by a group of terrorists, the nation is thrown into turmoil. Two weeks following the attack, Alexander is carried to victory by a sympathy vote, but his assailants have not been found. On the surface it appears to be the work of al-Qaeda, despite the tremendous job that the U.S. and her allies have done eliminating terrorist cells within the heart of America. While the FBI and the rest of the government begin scouring the world for jihadists, CIA director Irene Kennedy and Special Agent Skip McMahon are presented with classified information so toxic that they consider destroying it altogether, as it contains intelligence pointing to some of the most powerful players in Washington.Enter Mitch Rapp, the one man reckless enough to follow the evidence to its explosive conclusion.

Vincent Bugliosi,Reclaiming History – The Assassination of John F Kennedy,,English,,"This extraordinary and historic book required twenty years to research and write. The oft-challenged findings of the Warren Commission Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, shot and killed President John F. Kennedy are here confirmed beyond all doubt. But ""Reclaiming History"" does much more than that. In addition to providing a powerful and unprecedented narrative of events and a biography of the assassin, it confronts and destroys every one of the conspiracy theories that have grown up since the assassination, exposing their selective use of evidence, flawed logic, and outright deceptions. So thoroughly documented, so compellingly lucid in its conclusions, ""Reclaiming History"" is, in a sense, the investigation that completes the work of the Warren Commission. In it, Vincent Bugliosi, the nation's foremost prosecutor, takes on the most important murder in American history. At 1:00 p.m. on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead, the victim of a sniper attack during his motorcade through Dallas. That may be the only fact generally agreed upon in the vast literature spawned by the assassination. National polls reveal that an overwhelming majority of Americans (75%) believe that there was a high-level conspiracy behind Lee Harvey Oswald. Many even believe that Oswald was entirely innocent. In this continuously absorbing, powerful, ground-breaking book, Vincent Bugliosi shows how we have come to believe such lies about an event that changed the course of history. The brilliant prosecutor of Charles Manson and the man who forged an iron-clad case of circumstantial guilt around O. J. Simpson in his best-selling ""Outrage ""Bugliosi is perhaps the only man in America capable of writing the definitive book on the Kennedy assassination. This is an achievement that has for years seemed beyond reach. No one imagined that such a book would ever be written: a single volume that once and for all resolves, beyond any reasonable doubt, every lingering question as to what happened in Dallas and who was responsible. There have been hundreds of books about the assassination, but there has never been a book that covers ""the entire case,"" including addressing each and every conspiracy theory and the facts, or alleged facts, on which they are based. In this monumental work, the author has raised scholarship on the assassination to a new and final level, one that far surpasses all other books on the subject. It adds resonance, depth, and closure to the admirable work of the Warren Commission. ""Reclaiming History"" is a narrative compendium of fact, forensic evidence, reexamination of key witnesses, and common sense. Every detail and nuance is accounted for, every conspiracy theory revealed as a fraud on the American public. Bugliosi's irresistible logic, command of the evidence, and ability to draw startling inferences shed fresh light on this American nightmare. At last it all makes sense.",,,January 1st 2007,November 4th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'American History', 'Politics', 'Presidents', 'Audiobook', 'Conspiracy Theories', 'American']",,9780393045253,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348320144l/203795.jpg,4.1,['Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime (2008)'],36.0,1.0,,203795.Reclaiming_History_The_Assassination_of_John_F_Kennedy,,,,,91.0,1245.0,1612,,W.

Vincent Bugliosi,Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder,,English,,"Here at last is the account of the O.J. Simpson case that no one else has dared to write, that no one else could write. In Outrage, the famed prosecutor of Charles Manson and bestselling author of Helter Skelter goes to the heart of the trial that divided the country and made a mockery of justice.  Vincent Bugliosi, who never lost a murder case, brilliantly outlines the five reasons why O.J. Simpson got away with murder: the worst possible jury, a sloppy and incomplete prosecution, a fatal change of venue, judicial error that allowed the defense to play the race card, and a weak summation and rebuttal that barely addressed the defense's frame-up and conspiracy theories. He reveals:--The offer Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman should never have refused.--The bluff that saved the defense's cardboard case.--What Deputy Sheriff Jeff Stuart overheard when Rosey Grier visited Simpson in jail.--The 17 words Johnnie Cochran used to cover his argument that could have been his undoing if caught. --Why the jurors never heard Simpson's first police interview-- filled with self-incriminating statements that alone could have convicted him of murder.1.  What mistake in jury selection could have cost Marcia Clark the trial--even before she argued the case?2. What did Simpson do to make sure the gloves wouldn't fit?3. How did Judge Ito's behavior towards Marcia Clark prejudice the jury?4. Why did the prosecutors suppress Simpson's ""smoking gun""?5.

"Vincent R.

Visiting tourists are served beautiful beaches, sports and gastronomy numbing their senses. There are many things going on in this glorious nation that never make the headlines in their home countries. Important issues since they ultimately determine the state of Europe and its position in the world.  The EU, which has focused strongly on expansion, is fractionalizing. Politicians, who follow outdated economic indicators, fail to see what is really going on. They are clueless! Economic indicators and corruption are measured “post-action”. Therefore, they are merely consequences and not the causes of social-economic turmoil.  How can Europeans, speak of human rights issues in China, when thousands of women are forced to work in “alegal” prostitution in Spain? Many of whom are victims of human trafficking. Not to speak of the 100,000 African immigrants who work and live under slave-like conditions in Almeria.  Close to 30% of Spanish citizens lives on the verge of poverty. A number, which will not improve shortly. The EU keeps on pouring money into the largest single beneficiary, but “Espanistan” keeps on wasting it. It has the richest politicians and former politicians in Europe. Many Spanish citizens have lost hope.  The country is run by an invisible force that goes by many names (e.g. la casta). This force places itself above the law and overturns Supreme Court rulings, replaces critical judges in important cases, silences and bribes witnesses and exercises the outdated ""gag-law"". A law that clearly contradicts freedom of speech.  Unfortunately, the corrupt practices of politicians rub off on corporate structures and society and the country has proven – time and time again – it cannot run its EU-course without intervention. It Is Not What It Is reveals 7 characteristics that function as a handbrake on Spain's development and shows the devastating effects of a conformist's attitude when applied on a national level.   *** ""The way you look at Spain will never be the same again."" - Brian Larsen, CEO Bancore   *** ""Let's imagine (…) this Dutch immigrant is right and his criticisms are for our own good...

H. Auden In addition to his many remarkable paintings and drawings, Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) left behind a fascinating and voluminous body of correspondence. This highly accessible book includes a broad selection of 265 letters, from a total of 820 in existence, that focus on Van Gogh’s relentless quest to find his destiny, a search that led him to become an artist; the close bond with his brother Theo; his fraught relationship with his father; his innate yearning for recognition; and his great love of art and literature. The correspondence not only offers detailed insights into Van Gogh’s complex inner life, but also re-creates the world in which he lived and the artistic avant-garde that was taking hold in Paris.   The letters are accompanied by a general introduction, historic family photographs, and reproductions of 87 actual pages of letters that contain sketches by Van Gogh. Selected from the critically acclaimed 6-volume set of letters published by the Van Gogh Museum in 2009, Ever Yours is the essential book on Van Gogh’s letters, which every art and literature lover needs to own.  ",,,11/28/14,December 2nd 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Unfinished', 'Art History']",,9780300209471,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407975283l/21945153.jpg,4.43,[],1157.0,12.0,,21945153-ever-yours,,,,,96.0,203.0,784,,Yale University Press,"['126', '49', '20', '5', '3']",,,[],,
"Vincent van Gogh, Ronald de Leeuw (Editor), Arnold J. Pomerans (Translator)",The Letters of Vincent van Gogh,,English,,"A new selection of post-impressionist painter Vincent Van Gough's letters, The Letters of Vincent van Gogh put a human face on one of the most haunting figures in modern Western culture. In this Penguin Classics edition, the letters are selected and edited by Ronald de Leeuw, and translated by Arnold Pomerans in Penguin Classics.Few artists' letters are as self-revelatory as Vincent van Gogh's, and this selection, spanning his artistic career, sheds light on every facet of the life and work of this complex and tortured man. Engaging candidly and movingly with his religious struggles, his ill-fated search for love, his attacks of mental illness and his relation with his brother Theo, the letters contradict the popular myth of van Gogh as an anti-social madman and a martyr to art, showing instead a man of great emotional and spiritual depths. Above all, they stand as an intense personal narrative of artistic development and a unique account of the process of creation.The letters are linked by explanatory biographical passages, revealing van Gogh's inner journey as well as the outer facts of his life. This edition also includes the drawings that originally illustrated the letters.Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Holland. In 1885 he painted his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters, a haunting scene of domestic poverty. A year later he began studying in Paris, where he met Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Seurat, who became very important influences on his work. In 1888 he left Paris for the Provencal landscape at Arles, the subject of many of his best works, including Sunflowers.If you enjoyed The Letters of Vincent van Gogh, you might also like 100 Artists Manifestos, available in Penguin Modern Classics.'If there was ever any doubt that Van Gogh's letters belong beside those great classics of artistic self-revelation, Cellini's autobiography and Delacroix's journal, this excellent new edition dispels it'The Times",,,10/28/14,July 31st 1997,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'Art History', 'Classics', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Philosophy', '19th Century']",,9780140446746,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328110665l/395233.jpg,4.04,['PEN Translation Prize for Arnold Pomerans (1997)'],922.0,11.0,,395233.The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh,,,,,90.0,74511.0,528,,Penguin Classics,"['34373', '19985', '12414', '4263', '3476']",,,"['Brabant (Belgium)', 'London, England', 'Drenthe', 'Nuenen', 'Antwerp (Belgium)', 'Arles (France)', 'Saint-Remy (France)', 'Auvers', 'The Hague (Netherlands)']",,

E talvez devêssemos acrescentar: ele nunca nos decepciona, alçando-nos, ao contrário, além de nossas expectativas.Para viver um grande amor estrutura-se de modo singular: alterna poesia e prosa. As crônicas guardam as marcas típicas do gênero, como a observação aguda do cotidiano e a linguagem despojada. Mas, além disso, conforme o próprio Vinicius, ""há, para o leitor que se der ao trabalho de percorrê-las em sua integridade, uma unidade evidente que as enfeixa: a do grande amor"". Quanto aos poemas, encontram-se, aqui, exemplares de grande força expressiva, como o impactante ""Carta aos 'Puros'"".

That was Celina’s life with the pack who was supposed to take care of her. She was nothing but their slave.  And then one day, she decided that it had to stop. She would run away. And she did. And when she shifted, little did Celina know that she was the last pure white wolf in the world. Or that she was special. She just knew she was different.

Virginia De Winter,La spia del mare,,Italian,,"È il 1741. Mentre la scintillante e cosmopolita Repubblica di Venezia si prepara per le celebrazioni del Carnevale, una spia inglese di nome Cordelia Backson si mette sulle tracce di un feroce gruppo di assassini che celano la loro identità dietro le maschere della Commedia dell'Arte.Cordelia è bella e pericolosa, in grado di maneggiare ogni tipo di arma, esperta di combattimento e di intrighi politici, ma ancora ignora che qualcuno progetta la distruzione della Serenissima. E che l'uomo a capo di questo efferato complotto è profondamente legato alla sua vita e a quella di ogni singolo componente della sua famiglia – i Giustinian. Sarà proprio ricostruendo ciò che è accaduto in passato che Cordelia si troverà a sciogliere gli enigmi che coinvolgono i suoi genitori e la sua gemella Cassandra.Ma a tormentarla c'è anche altro: Cassian D'Armer, un giovane uomo alto e bruno di sconvolgente bellezza, il cui sguardo fiero e cupo intimidisce chiunque tenti di avvicinarlo e che il caso ha messo sulla sua strada.Sarà Cassian ad accompagnarla nella sua missione insieme a tre amici: Alain de Mortemart, un aristocratico francese fuggito dalla corte di Versailles, il giovane abate Giacomo Casanova, libertino impenitente, e un nobile spagnolo in esilio volontario. Nessuno di loro è un cittadino gradito alla Repubblica, ognuno nasconde terribili segreti, ma, quando il pericolo incomberà su Venezia, il Doge non esiterà a reclutarli come spie, promettendo in cambio la grazia per i loro delitti e rischiando di portare alla luce il più oscuro tra i misteri che offuscano la storia della Serenissima.Attraverso un'attenta ricostruzione storica, affiancando con maestria personaggi reali e di finzione, con una scrittura appassionata e accesa di accattivante umorismo, Virginia de Winter dà vita a un thriller incalzante dalle atmosfere tenebrose, portando sulla scena popolata dalle maschere del Carnevale agenti segreti, alchimisti e uomini di Stato.

Virginia Mendoza (Goodreads Author),Heridas del viento,,Spanish,,"Armenia, el país en el que todo es posible, el país que, como eterna Arca de Noé, pone a resguardo de tempestades humanas y de las otras, variopintas especies de su cultura milenaria. Allí se convive con una historia extravagante en la que persas, árabes, mongoles, turcos y rusos han querido llevar el timón. Aún hoy Armenia, el viejo país de cuatro mil años, el primero de la cristiandad, el que ejerce de bisagra entre oriente y occidente, mantiene más del doble de su población en la diáspora. Ser armenio significa ser superviviente: guerras, invasiones, terremotos, masacres y un pavoroso genocidio que se llevó un millón y medio de vidas, según sus cuentas. Este libro habla de historias imposibles, pero ciertas. Personajes que levantan hoy el país con mucho amor y mejor humor. Virginia Mendoza entra en sus casas y comparte mesa con algunos de los últimos supervivientes de ese genocidio, visita a los yazidíes que rinden culto a Melek Taus, el Ángel Pavo Real, o a los cristianos molokanes, bebedores de leche; habla con la viuda del constructor de un templo subterráneo para salvar a la humanidad del fuego; nos presenta a los homenajeadores de Jachaturian y a la nieta de una esclava. Voces sabias, a veces llenas de melancolía, pero siempre esperanzadas. No deja de ser una ironía amarga que el símbolo de su identidad, el monte Ararat, esté del otro lado de la frontera como emblema de la presencia de una ausencia. Pero «no intentes comprender.

Permanecer o partir se convierten en actos de rebeldía e independencia. Los hombres y mujeres de estas páginas podrían ser los protagonistas de las novelas de Miguel Delibes y Julio Llamazares.

Años después, mi abuela Francisca —la que guarda tres mortajas, por si acaso, para no molestar—, me pidió que le pinte los labios cuando muera. Empecé a creer que la gente de su generación estaba obsesionada con la muerte. Me equivocaba.

Virginia Woolf,Mrs Dalloway,,,Fiction,"Elegantly interweaving her characters' complex inner lives in an unbroken stream of consciousness, Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway continues to enthral readers with its exploration of the human experience; of time, space, madness and regret. This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Stella McNichol with an introduction and notes by Elaine Showalter.Past, present and future are brought together one momentous June day in 1923.Clarissa Dalloway, elegant and vivacious, is preparing for a party while reminiscing about her childhood romance with Peter Walsh, and dwelling on her daughter Elizabeth's rapidly-approaching adulthood. In another part of London, war veteran Septimus Smith is shell-shocked and on the brink of madness, slowly spiralling towards self-annihilation. Their experiences mingling, yet never quite meeting, Virginia Woolf masterfully portrays a serendipitous unity of inner lives, converging as the party reaches its glittering climax. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of 'The Bloomsbury Group'. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway(1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves(1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando(1928) and A Room of One's Own(1929) a passionate feminist essay.If you enjoyed Mrs Dalloway, you might like James Joyce's Ulysses, also available in Penguin Classics.'The book's celebrated stream of consciousness is one of the few genuine innovations in the history of the novel'New Yorker",,,,2000.0,,,,0141182490,9780141182490,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fp7Ty0jyc1MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.79,,,,,,,,,,,,233.0,,,,2128.0,,,,

Virginia Woolf,Orlando,,English,,"Virginia Woolf's Orlando 'The longest and most charming love letter in literature', playfully constructs the figure of Orlando as the fictional embodiment of Woolf's close friend and lover, Vita Sackville-West. Spanning three centuries, the novel opens as Orlando, a young nobleman in Elizabeth's England, awaits a visit from the Queen and traces his experience with first love as England under James I lies locked in the embrace of the Great Frost.

Virginia Woolf,The Years,,English,,"The most popular of Virginia Woolf's novels during her lifetime, The Years is a savage indictment of British society at the turn of the century, edited with an introduction and notes by Jeri Johnson in Penguin Modern Classics.The Years is the story of three generations of the Pargiter family - their intimacies and estrangements, anxieties and triumphs - mapped out against the bustling rhythms of London's streets during the first decades of the twentieth century. Growing up in a typically Victorian household, the Pargiter children must learn to find their footing in an alternative world, where the rules of etiquette have shifted from the drawing-room to the air-raid shelter. A work of fluid and dazzling lucidity, The Years eschews a simple line of development in favour of a varied and constantly changing style, emphasises the radical discontinuity of personal experiences and historical events.

If the novel before Mrs. Dalloway aspired to immensities of scope and scale, to heroic journeys across vast landscapes, with Mrs. Dalloway Virginia Woolf insisted that it could also locate the enormous within the everyday; that a life of errands and party-giving was every bit as viable a subject as any life lived anywhere; and that should any human act in any novel seem unimportant, it has merely been inadequately observed. The novel as an art form has not been the same since.""Mrs. Dalloway also contains some of the most beautiful, complex, incisive and idiosyncratic sentences ever written in English, and that alone would be reason enough to read it.

Conflictul la hotar generează trăirile femeii - ale Emmei, și, implicit, ipostazele în care ea ripostează sau încheie armistiții. Sigur e una – nu există o altă cale de mijloc decât dragostea.- Mă iubești?- Mai mult decât vreodată.- Și totuși pleci?- Da! Pentru că mă lași să fac asta...Emmei îi este teamă de singurătate. Ea vrea să râdă cu el din același motiv. Ea ține minte săruturile pe care nu i le-a dat. Ea vrea să fie fericită în patul lui. Ea știe că cele mai bune vinuri se beau în doi. Ea caută să construiască poduri peste neînțelegerile din trecut. Ea vrea să meargă desculț pe malul mării. Sunt momente când revine la acea îmbrățișare din trecut, la plimbările nocturne, la momentele în care a râs și la cele în care a suferit. Și sunt momente în care visează undeva departe sau se bucură fericită de prezent. Iubindu-l pe Greg sau trăindu-și emoțiile. Ea caută un loc sfințit de dragoste. Ea mereu se întoarce la el.Citind De vorbă cu Emma, trăiești împreună cu ea propria ta poveste de viață. Emma te provoacă să găsești calea spre sufletul tău și te cheamă într-o lume în care liniștea, nebunia și iubirea adevărată sunt un tot întreg. Fie că ești femeie și o înțelegi, fie că ești bărbat și cauți calea spre inima ei, ai nevoie de niște răspunsuri. Le găsești printre dialoguri și rânduri scrise de el sau trăite de ea.Până la urmă Emma poți fi tu cu experiențele și poveștile tale de dragoste. Empatizând cu ea în anonimat vei ajunge să o lași să poarte și să consume câteva dintre zbuciumurile tale. La finalul acestei cărți vei îmbrățișa mai mult împăcarea cu tine însăți, te vei simți mai senină, mai pregătită să accepți, să înțelegi și să iubești. Vei fi gata să începi un nou capitol în viața ta. Pentru că temerile, trăirile și visurile Emmei sunt și ale tale. Iar dacă Emma le depășește, le vei depăși și tu.Ia-ți o cafea fierbinte, așează-te în colțul tău de lume, lasă un oraș pustiu în spate, deschide cartea și stai de vorbă cu tine.Despre autorVitali Cipileaga este autorul blogului www.devorbacutine.eu, scriind despre oameni, dragoste și relații.

"Vitsentzos Kornaros, Βιτσέντζος Κορνάρος",Ερωτόκριτος,,"Greek, Modern (1453-)",,"Η παρούσα έκδοση έρχεται να αναδείξει ένα ξεχωριστό χειρόγραφο του 1787, με μια ιδιαίτερα ελκυστική σε σημασία εικονογράφηση του ποιήματος του ""Ερωτόκριτου"". Πρόκειται για το μοναδικό σωζόμενο χειρόγραφο με χρωματιστές μινιατούρες, που ανήκει στο τμήμα σπανίων χειρογράφων της Βιβλιοθήκης της Ρουμανικής Ακαδημίας.Παρά την πληθύ των φιλολογικών μελετών γύρω από την καταγωγή και τη γνησιότητα του ποιήματος του Βιτζέντζου Κορνάρου για τον ""Ερωτόκριτο"", από Έλληνες και ξένους μελετητές, η παρούσα έκδοση εστιάζει την προσοχή της όχι στο κείμενο αλλά στην εικόνα. Μια εικόνα που, αν και είναι συνδεδεμένη με τη μετάφραση του ποιήματος στα ρουμανικά, έχει να πει περισσότερα ίσως, πέραν του μελοδράματος, στο χώρο της αισθητικής αποτύπωσης του φαναριώτικου Ελληνισμού. Ενός Ελληνισμού που συνέβαλε τα μέγιστα στην ελληνική παιδεία -αρχαία και βυζαντινή- του βαλκανικού κόσμου.Αυτή η σπάνια σε ευρηματικότητα και πλούτο λαϊκή ζωγραφική αντανακλά την ευρύτερη πολιτιστική και αισθητική κατεύθυνση της εποχής, κατά την οποία, παρά την οθωμανική κυριαρχία, επεκράτησε η ελληνική γραμμή των γραμμάτων, μέσα από την εκπαίδευση, τα βιβλία και την τέχνη, στον τότε ""ενιαίο"" χώρο των Βαλκανίων.Το παραπάνω γεγονός δε θα μπορούσε καμιά άλλη μορφή τέχνης να το διανθίσει, παρά η ύπαρξη αυτής της εικόνας που προέρχεται προσχηματικά από τον ""Ερωτόκριτο"", αλλά ουσιαστικά καταγράφει πολλά γνωρίσματα ενός κατακερματισμένου Ελληνισμού. Από τα πιο γνωστά δημώδη βιβλία του 18ου αιώνα στην Ελλάδα και στη Ρουμανία υπήρξαν ο ""Χρονογράφος"" των Ψευδό-Δωροθέου και Κιγάλα και ο ""Ερωτόκριτος"" του Κορνάρου. Ο γνωστός λόγιος και μοναχός της εποχής Καισάριος Δαπόντε, αναφερόμενος στην ευρύτερη διάδοση του κρητικού έπους στη Ρουμανία, έγραφε στα τέλη του 18ου αιώνα:""Και επαινούνται δυνατά, και τα συγγράμματα τους πολλοί τα έχουν, τα βαστούν εις τα προσκέφαλα τους, μάλιστα τον Ρωτόκριτον, όστις και ετυπώθη ως τώρα τέσσαρες φορές ..."".

Viv Albertine,"Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys",,English,,"The guitarist for seminal female punk group The Slits recounts playing with Sid Vicious, touring with the Clash, dating Mick Jones, inspiring “Train in Vain,” and releasing her solo debut in 2012Viv Albertine is one of a handful of original punks who changed music, and the discourse around it, forever. Her memoir tells the story of how, through sheer will, talent, and fearlessness, she forced herself into a male-dominated industry, became part of a movement that changed music, and inspired a generation of female rockers.After forming The Flowers of Romance with Sid Vicious in 1976, Albertine joined The Slits and made musical history in one of the first generations of punk bands. The Slits would go on to serve as an inspiration to future rockers, including Kurt Cobain, Carrie Brownstein, and the Riot Grrrl movement in the 1990s. This is the story of what it was like to be a girl at the height of punk: the sex, the drugs, the guys, the tours, and being part of a brilliant pioneering group of women making musical history. Albertine recounts helping define punk fashion, struggling to find her place among the boys, and her romance with Mick Jones, including her pregnancy and subsequent abortion. She also gives a candid account of what happened post-punk, beyond the break-up of The Slits in 1982, including a career in film, surviving cancer, and making music again, twenty-five years later.A truly remarkable memoir told in Viv’s frank, irreverent, and distinctive voice, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes.

"Vivian Gornick, Jonathan Lethem (Introduction)",Fierce Attachments: A Memoir,,English,,"In this deeply etched and haunting memoir, Vivian Gornick tells the story of her lifelong battle with her mother for independence. There have been numerous books about mother and daughter, but none has dealt with this closest of filial relations as directly or as ruthlessly. Gornick's groundbreaking book confronts what Edna O'Brien has called ""the prinicpal crux of female despair"": the unacknowledged Oedipal nature of the mother-daughter bond.Born and raised in the Bronx, the daughter of ""urban peasants,"" Gornick grows up in a household dominated by her intelligent but uneducated mother's romantic depression over the early death of her husband. Next door lives Nettie, an attractive widow whose calculating sensuality appeals greatly to Vivian. These women with their opposing models of femininity continue, well into adulthood, to affect Gornick's struggle to find herself in love and in work.As Gornick walks with her aged mother through the streets of New York, arguing and remembering the past, each wins the reader's admiration: the caustic and clear-thinking daughter, for her courage and tenacity in really talking to her mother about the most basic issues of their lives, and the still powerful and intuitively-wise old woman, who again and again proves herself her daughter's mother.Unsparing, deeply courageous, Fierce Attachments is one of the most remarkable documents of family feeling that has been written, a classic that helped start the memoir boom and remains one of the most moving examples of the genre.",,,04/01/87,September 14th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Womens', 'Feminism', 'American', 'New York', 'Autobiography', 'Family']",,9780374529963,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316635674l/177333.jpg,4.0,[],93.0,1.0,,177333.Fierce_Attachments,,,,,95.0,5312.0,224,,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","['1742', '2158', '1135', '225', '52']",,,[],,

And why would a odd little man that can spin straw into gold do so in exchange for a tiny gold ring? The story is just silly.

"Vladimir Bartol, Michael Biggins (Translator)",Alamut,,English,,"Alamut takes place in 11th Century Persia, in the fortress of Alamut, where self-proclaimed prophet Hasan ibn Sabbah is setting up his mad but brilliant plan to rule the region with a handful elite fighters who are to become his ""living daggers."" By creating a virtual paradise at Alamut, filled with beautiful women, lush gardens, wine and hashish, Sabbah is able to convince his young fighters that they can reach paradise if they follow his commands.With parallels to Osama bin Laden, Alamut tells the story of how Sabbah was able to instill fear into the ruling class by creating a small army of devotees who were willing to kill, and be killed, in order to achieve paradise. Believing in the supreme Ismaili motto “Nothing is true, everything is permitted,” Sabbah wanted to “experiment” with how far he could manipulate religious devotion for his own political gain through appealing to what he called the stupidity and gullibility of people and their passion for pleasure and selfish desires. The novel focuses on Sabbah as he unveils his plan to his inner circle, and on two of his young followers — the beautiful slave girl Halima, who has come to Alamut to join Sabbah's paradise on earth, and young ibn Tahir, Sabbah's most gifted fighter. As both Halima and ibn Tahir become disillusioned with Sabbah's vision, their lives take unexpected turns. Alamut was originally written in 1938 as an allegory to Mussolini's fascist state. In the 1960's it became a cult favorite throughout Tito's Yugoslavia, and in the 1990s, during the Balkan's War, it was read as an allegory of the region's strife and became a bestseller in Germany, France and Spain. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the book once again took on a new life, selling more than 20,000 copies in a new Slovenian edition, and being translated around the world in more than 19 languages.

Vladimir Jankélévitch,Music and the Ineffable,,English,,"Vladimir Jank�l�vitch left behind a remarkable œuvre steeped as much in philosophy as in music. His writings on moral quandaries reflect a lifelong devotion to music and performance, and, as a counterpoint, he wrote on music aesthetics and on modernist composers such as Faur�, Debussy, and Ravel. Music and the Ineffable brings together these two threads, the philosophical and the musical, as an extraordinary quintessence of his thought. Jank�l�vitch deals with classical issues in the philosophy of music, including metaphysics and ontology. These are a point of departure for a sustained examination and dismantling of the idea of musical hermeneutics in its conventional sense.Music, Jank�l�vitch argues, is not a hieroglyph, not a language or sign system; nor does it express emotions, depict landscapes or cultures, or narrate. On the other hand, music cannot be imprisoned within the icy, morbid notion of pure structure or autonomous discourse. Yet if musical works are not a cipher awaiting the decoder, music is nonetheless entwined with human experience, and with the physical, material reality of music in performance. Music is ""ineffable,"" as Jank�l�vitch puts it, because it cannot be pinned down, and has a capacity to engender limitless resonance in several domains. Jank�l�vitch's singular work on music was central to such figures as Roland Barthes and Catherine Cl�ment, and the complex textures and rhythms of his lyrical prose sound a unique note, until recently seldom heard outside the francophone world.",,,1961,July 28th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Music', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']",,9780691090474,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372040852l/538926.jpg,4.24,[],4.0,1.0,,538926.Music_and_the_Ineffable,,,,,94.0,51.0,171,,Princeton University Press,"['24', '19', '5', '2', '1']",,,[],,

Pourquoi est-il étonné chaque fois qu'un vivant disparaît, comme si cela arrivait chaque fois pour la première fois? Telles sont les questions que pose ce livre sur la mort. Dans chacun de ses ouvrages, Vladimir Jankélévitch a essayé de saisir le cas limite, l'expérience aiguë : à son point de tangence avec ces frontières, l'homme se situe à la pointe de l'humain, là où le mystère, l'ineffable, le ""je-ne-sais-quoi"", ouvrent le passage de l'être au néant, ou de l'être à l'absolument-autre.

Vladimir Nabokov,Bend Sinister,,English,,"The state has been recently taken over and is being run by the tyrannical and philistine ‘Average Man’ party. Under the slogans of equality and happiness for all, it has done away with individualism and freedom of thought. Only John Krug, a brilliant philosopher, stands up to the regime. His antagonist, the leader of the new party, is his old school enemy, Paduk – known as the ‘Toad’. Grieving over his wife’s recent death, Krug is at first dismissive of Paduk’s activities and sees no threat in them. But the sinister machine which Paduk has set in motion may prove stronger than the individual, stronger even than the grotesque ‘Toad’ himself. The first novel Nabokov wrote while living in America and the most overtly political novel he ever wrote, Bend Sinister is a modern classic.  While it is filled with veiled puns and characteristically delightful wordplay, it is, first and foremost, a haunting and compelling narrative about a civilized man caught in the tyranny of a police state.  Professor Adam Krug, the country's foremost philosopher, offers the only hope of resistance to Paduk, dictator and leader of the Party of the Average Man.  In a folly of bureaucratic bungling and ineptitude, the government attempts to co-opt Krug's support in order to validate the new regime.",,Penguin Modern Classics,10/30/47,August 4th 2015,"['Adam Krug', 'Paduk', 'Olga Krug', 'David Krug', 'Ember']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Russia', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Russian Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",,9780141185767,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504377419l/142529._SY475_.jpg,3.82,[],98.0,1.0,,142529.Bend_Sinister,,,,,92.0,3879.0,208,,Penguin Books Ltd,"['957', '1603', '1026', '242', '51']",,,[],,

After Knight's death, his half brother sets out to penetrate the enigma of his life, starting with a few scanty clues in the novelist's private papers.

Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov's Laughter in the Dark; this, the author tells us, is the whole story except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterwork as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others. Published first in Russian as Kamera Obskura in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov's own English translation six years later.

The novel deals with the problem of unwanted children that complicate the lives of sexual partners and an attempted infanticide.

Víctor Hugo Morales,Audiencia con el diablo,,Spanish,,"¿Por qué un empresario de la comunicación se atreve a denunciar a un periodista? ¿De qué manera puede entenderse que el dueño de un multimedios que se define como independiente, y que se dice defensor de la libertad de expresión, pretenda silenciar a un comunicador? El 8 de agosto de 2013 Héctor Magnetto, CEO del Grupo Clarín, debía verse cara a cara con Víctor Hugo Morales, a quien había denunciado ante la justicia. Aunque el encuentro entre ellos, en verdad, no se produjo, la situación reflejó como pocas el estado actual en materia de medios de comunicación. El 12 de junio de 1989 cambió la historia argentina. En La Rioja, el presidente electo, Carlos Menem, se reunía con Héctor Magnetto. Allí, juntos, delinearon el futuro del país. Desde entonces, y durante casi quince años, el Estado sería un esqueleto, devorado por las privatizaciones. Y Clarín resultaría uno de los mayores beneficiados. Para sostener las profundas desigualdades que han azotado América Latina desde hace décadas, es preciso contar con una poderosa maquinaria de construcción de subjetividad que legitime esas desigualdades. Los medios hegemónicos, con su arsenal de diarios, canales de noticias, radios y sitios de Internet, son esa maquinaria. Audiencia con el diablo narra con mirada atenta y precisa los mecanismos que los medios hegemónicos utilizan para perpetuar su dominio. Y lo hace con una escritura bella, muchas veces poética, pero llena de información y de análisis. Víctor Hugo Morales ha escrito un libro en el que las reflexiones sobre la política, el periodismo y el poder conviven con los recuerdos personales y su propia mirada del mundo.
