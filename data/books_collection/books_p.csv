Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom,,"['Pirates', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Media Tie In', 'Adult']","Twenty-five-year-old Jack Sparrow is a clean-cut merchant seaman pursuing a legitimate career as a first mate for the East India Trading Company. He sometimes thinks back to his boyhood pirating days, but he doesn't miss Teague's scrutiny or the constant threat of the noose. Besides, he doesn't have much choice-he broke the Code when he freed a friend who had been accused of rogue piracy, and he can no longer show his face in Shipwreck Cove. When Jack's ship is attacked by pirates and his captain dies in the altercation, he suddenly finds himself in command. The wily sailor's skillful negotiations with the pirate captain-who turns out to be a woman from his past-result in a favorable outcome that puts Jack in line for an official promotion.  After making port in Africa, Jack is summoned by Cutler Beckett, who makes him captain of a ship called the Wicked Wench. Beckett gives Jack an assignment. He has heard a legend about a magical island named Zerzura whose labyrinthine bowels are said to contain a glorious treasure. Beckett suspects that one of his house slaves, a girl named Ayisha, is from Zerzura. He asks Jack to take her along on his voyage and seduce her into divulging the island's whereabouts. In payment for his services, Beckett promises Jack a share of the treasure.  But this task isn't as easy as Jack initially believes. Before she agrees to reveal the location of her home, Ayisha insists that Jack take her to the New World to rescue her brother, who has been sold into slavery in the Bahamas. Their voyage is long and arduous, and as they weather a vicious storm and a surprise attack from an old pirate foe, Jack grows to respect and admire Ayisha's bravery. He knows that Beckett intends to enslave her people after robbing them of their treasure, and Jack's moral compass revolts at the idea. It might be possible to deliver Ayisha safely to Zerzura, obtain some of the treasure, and convince Beckett that he never found it . . . but the greedy E. I. T. C. official has eyes everywhere, and if he learns that Jack has foiled his plans, he could take away the thing that Captain Sparrow loves most: his ship-and his freedom.",,,,2011,[],Hardcover,,9781423107040,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327914536l/4558004.jpg,4.2,[],219.0,3.0,,,,92.0,862.0,653,Disney Editions,"['438', '245', '110', '49', '20']",,[],,['A.

Paris to the Moon,,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'France', 'Essays', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Unfinished', 'Family']","With singular wit and insight, Gopnik weaves the magical with the mundane in a wholly delightful, often hilarious look at what it was to be an American family man in Paris at the end of the twentieth century.Paris. The name alone conjures images of chestnut-lined boulevards, sidewalk cafés, breathtaking façades around every corner--in short, an exquisite romanticism that has captured the American imagination for as long as there have been Americans.In 1995, Adam Gopnik, his wife, and their infant son left the familiar comforts and hassles of New York City for the urbane glamour of the City of Light. Gopnik is a longtime New Yorker writer, and the magazine has sent its writers to Paris for decades--but his was above all a personal pilgrimage to the place that had for so long been the undisputed capital of everything cultural and beautiful. It was also the opportunity to raise a child who would know what it was to romp in the Luxembourg Gardens, to enjoy a croque monsieur in a Left Bank café--a child (and perhaps a father, too) who would have a grasp of that Parisian sense of style we Americans find so elusive.So, in the grand tradition of the American abroad, Gopnik walked the paths of the Tuileries, enjoyed philosophical discussions at his local bistro, wrote as violet twilight fell on the arrondissements. Of course, as readers of Gopnik's beloved and award-winning ""Paris Journals"" in The New Yorker know, there was also the matter of raising a child and carrying on with day-to-day, not-so-fabled life. Evenings with French intellectuals preceded middle-of-the-night baby feedings; afternoons were filled with trips to the Musée d'Orsay and pinball games; weekday leftovers were eaten while three-star chefs debated a ""culinary crisis.""As Gopnik describes in this funny and tender book, the dual processes of navigating a foreign city and becoming a parent are not completely dissimilar journeys--both hold new routines, new languages, a new set of rules by which everyday life is lived. With singular wit and insight, Gopnik weaves the magical with the mundane in a wholly delightful, often hilarious look at what it was to be an American family man in Paris at the end of the twentieth century.

It’s about inventing a whole new game—defining a new market category, developing it, and dominating it over time. You can’t build a legendary company without building a legendary category. If you think that having the best product is all it takes to win, you’re going to lose. In this farsighted, pioneering guide, the founders of Silicon Valley advisory firm Play Bigger rely on data analysis and interviews to understand the inner workings of “category kings”— companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, Uber and IKEA that give us new ways of living, thinking or doing business, often solving problems we didn’t know we had.In Play Bigger, the authors assemble their findings to introduce the new discipline of category design. By applying category design, companies can create new demand where none existed, conditioning customers’ brains so they change their expectations and buying habits. While this discipline defines the tech industry, it applies to every kind of industry and even to personal careers.Crossing The Chasm revolutionized how we think about new products in an existing market.

Peter the First,,"['History', 'Classics', 'Russia', 'Russian Literature', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Russian History', 'Literature', 'Nonfiction', '18th Century']","Here, for the first time, in its final form and in a new translation, is the epic Russian novel which has sold in its native country over two million copies. Alexey Tolstoy (who was not related to the author of War and Peace) began to study the character of his hero, Peter the First, in 1917. When he died almost thirty years later, Tolstoy was still working on his masterpiece, this huge historical canvas which gives brilliant life and meaning to a crucial period in Russian history. Tolstoy reanimates the past by a succession of character creations which range from the serf, Ivan Brodkin, to Peter's sinister and opportunistic favorite, Alexander Menshikoff; from the old Boyars shorn of their beards and their prerogatives to the foreign captains of the new Russian navy. Here in these pages are the beautiful Anna Mons, Peter's first mistress; his wife Eudoxia, whom he never loved; and the peasant girl who eventually was to be crowned Empress Catherine the First. We see these men and women moving across a tapestry of battles abroad, and amid the dark, opulent luxury of the great families and the Imperial Court. In Tolstoy's moving crowded pages we see the emergence of Russia, thrust forward by Peter's inexorable will, from a backward medieval state to her final position as one of the great powers of Europe. Here are magnificent portraits, the fruits of years of historical research, of Peter's principal opponents: August, Elector of Saxony, indefatigable in his amusements, and King Charles XII of Sweden, a great military genius, flawed by passion and indulgence. But the true hero of Tolstoy's epic is Peter himself. We see him grow to be a man---awkward, suspicious, prone to spasms of cowardice, but always driving, sometimes provoked almost to madness, to free his country from the chains of backwardness and superstition to take her place as an equal among the nations of the west. And in the last analysis it is this greatness and originality of character in its hero which gives the stamp of greatness to the book itself. Alexey Tolstoy was born in 1883. In 1918 he published his first full length work, Nikita's Childhood. In 1919 he fled from the Bolshevik government and settled in Paris. In 1922 he asked for and received permission to return home.

Psycho Shop,,Fiction,"﻿“A dark acid curio, brisk, fast, memorable, a rare improvisational duet from two of our best.”—Greg Bear “Alfred Bester was one of the handful of writers who invented modern science fiction.” —Harry Harrison, author of Adventures of the Stanless Steel Rat “Let there be light, and let there always be Roger Zelazny.”—Philip José Farmer, author of To Your Scattered Bodies Go From Publishers Weekly: This odd novel, left incomplete when Bester died in 1987, was finished by Zelazny, who himself died in 1995. In his introduction, Bear refers to Bester (The Deceivers) and Zelazny (Donnerjack) as masters of SF jazz, geniuses of improvisation, and the book has that feel to it. The plot is full of bizarre twists and turns. Neat ideas surface and disappear in an eyeblink and characters transform radically from one page to the next. Alf Noir, an investigative reporter, is sent to Rome to look into the mysterious Black Place of the Soul-Changer and its enigmatic proprietor, Adam Maser. Alf discovers that Maser is a Psychbroker, a sort of pawnbroker of the spirit, dealing in emotions, talents and psychological traits. Want more courage, the ability to see into the infrared, an understanding of ancient Persian? Maser will trade it to you for your mind-reading ability, or a rare coin, or perhaps for the secret of the collective unconscious. Alf discovers that Maser isn't human, but a highly evolved cat from the far future. Nothing is what it seems and no one can be trusted, not even Maser's sexy assistant, an evolved snake with whom Alf has an affair. There's much fun to be had here, but the book doesn't represent either writer in top form. Bester's style in the first part of the novel seems dated, and things don't gel until Zelazny takes over halfway through the book. Vintage has brought Bester's finest work back into print, and for this it deserves praise, but this novel is most likely to appeal to Zelazny's much larger readership.",,,,2013.0,,,0679767827,9780679767824,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X9OCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.6,,,,,,,,,207.0,,,727.0,,,"['Alfred Bester', 'Roger Zelazny']"

"Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson",,"['Poetry', 'Classics', '19th Century', 'Fiction']","The poems in this volume have been chosen, in a sense, to give Tennyson back to his readers. Few modern readers realize the true quality and range of his work, or are aware of his many moods.Alfred Tennyson was the poetic spokesman of the Victorian age. No other so completely embodied the spirit of his times, and surely none ever enjoyed such contemporary acclaim.Perhaps this very acclaim has blinded us to his actual work. We forget that, before he was a patriarch, Tennyson was a young poet, with a young man's vigor and variety, and that all his life he was a craftsman of infinite skill.Mrs. Rausen's selection demonstrates the scope of Tennyson's interest and art. The masculine enthusiasm of the ballad of ""The Revenge"" contrasts with the graceful lyrics from ""The Princess,"" the philosophical speculation of ""In Memoriam"" with the ancient legends of Arthur and Maeldune. Through all of Tennyson's poems runs a fascination with nature. It is a theme in itself for him, and a vivid device in the creation of mood as well. But, above all, his poems are distinguished by their music--by the beat of ores and the thunder of the sea, the dreaming chant of the lotos-eaters and the clear call of a trumpet.

As a young woman, a misguided loyalty to the customs of her people led her to voluntarily submit to the tsunga's knife and be genitally mutilated (pharoanoically circumcised). Severely traumatized by this experience, she spends the rest of her life battling madness, trying desperately through psychotherapy - she is treated by disciples of both Freud and C.G. Jung, and even by Jung himself - to regain the ability to recognize her own reality and to feel. It is only with the help of the most unlikely ally she can imagine that she begins to study the mythological ""reasons"" invented by her ancient ancestors for what was done to her and to millions of other women and girls over thousands of years. As her understanding grows, so does her capacity to encounter her overwhelming grief. Underneath this grief is her glowing anger. Anger propels her to act. Action brings both feeling - life, the ability to exist with awareness in the moment - and death, of which she finds she has completely lost her fear.While not a sequel to The Color Purple or The Temple of My Familiar, Possessing the Secret of Joy follows the life of a barely-glimpsed character from those books.

Pendulum,Leon Foucault and the Triumph of Science,Biography & Autobiography,"He was neither a mathematician nor a trained physicist and yet Léon Foucault always knew that a mysterious force of nature was among us. Like Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, and others before him, Foucault sensed a dramatic relationship between the rotating skies above and the seemingly motionless ground beneath our feet. But it wasn't until 1851 -- in Paris, inside the Panthéon, and in the company of fellow amateur scientist Napoleon III -- that Foucault swung a pendulum and demonstrated an extraordinary truth about the world: that it turns on its axis. Pendulum is a fascinating journey through the mind and findings of one of the most important and lesser-known characters in the history of science. Through careful research and lively anecdotes, world-renowned author Amir D. Aczel reveals the astonishing range and breadth of Foucault's discoveries. For, in addition to offering the first unequivocal proof of Earth's rotation, Foucault gave us the modern electric compass and microscope, was a pioneer in photographic technology, and made remarkable deductions about color theory, heat waves, and the speed of light. At its heart, Pendulum is a story about the illustrious period in France during the Second Empire; the crucial triumph of science over religion; and, most compelling, the life of a struggling, self-made man whose pursuit of knowledge continues to inform our notions about the universe today.",,,,2004.0,,,0743464796,9780743464796,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GKhhPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.72,,,,,,,,,288.0,,,179.0,,,['Amir D.

Novel Padang Bulan bermula dari kisah seorang gadis kecil berusia 14 tahun, Enong namanya, yang sangat gemar pada pelajaran bahasa Inggris, namun secara mendadak terpaksa harus berhenti sekolah dan mengambil alih seluruh tanggung jawab keluarga. Tersambung pada sekuel novel ini, Cinta di Dalam Gelas, perjalanan nasib anak perempuan kecil itu, melalui gaya khasnya: menertawakan kepedihan, memarodikan tragedi, mengkritik tanpa menjadi sarkastik, kisah Enong menjadi seperti panggung di dalam lembaran-lembaran kertas. Membaca novel ini seperti melihat sebuah gambar. Dengan menceritakan kisah Enong seperti sebuah epos, Andrea berhasil memperlihatkan kepada pembaca kekuatan-kekuatan besar yang tersembunyi di dalam diri manusia, kekuatan yang sering tidak disadari seseorang berada di dalam dirinya. Enong jatuh, bangun, jatuh lagi, dan bangun lagi. Kisah Enong tidak sekadar kisah sebuah keluarga yang sederhana, namun tentang impian seorang anak kecil, tentang keberanian menjalani hidup, dan tentang seorang lelaki yang menjadi berantakan karena tragedi cinta pertama. ""Cemburu adalah perahu Nabi Nuh yang tergenang di dalam hati yang karam.

Succinct and astonishingly beautiful, these pieces stretch the boundaries of language and literary form, while juxtaposing classical and modern traditions. Carson envisions a present-day interview with a seventh-century BC poet, and offers miniature lectures on topics as varied as orchids and Ovid. She imagines the muse of a fifteenth-century painter attending a phenomenology conference in Italy. She constructs verbal photographs of a series of mysterious towns, and takes us on a pilgrimage in pursuit of the elusive and intimate anthropology of water.

They remain, certainly, the songs of Israel: from its cries of lamentation to its shouts of exultation. But for the Christian reader, they become as well hymns of petition and praise that express both the joy and the longing of those who live 'in Christ' . . . At the same time their very language can convey to us the assurance that, as he has throughout the millennia, God hears our prayer and responds to it with boundless mercy, love, and compassion.""--from the Preface by Fr. John Breck Professor Sheehan's brief introductory exposition of the Davidic roots of Psalms and the poetics of chiasmus guides us in understanding how the ruining oppositions of actual experience are held in Psalms within the musical disciplines of lyric art: held, until God Himself can be seen in the ruins: seen, and felt, and overwhelmingly and gratefully loved.

Ma con la metafisica, in questa ricerca spasmodica e pellegrina, si sposa un concetto tutto terrestre della vita: sapori, odori, luoghi, città, fotografie che sono legati al nostro immaginario, ai nostri sogni, ma anche alla nostra quotidiana esperienza. E allora? Nella sua nota Tabucchi suggerisce di pensare a un monaco vestito di rosso, a Hölderlin e a una canzone napoletana. Potranno forse sembrare degli ingredienti incongrui.

Plan of Attack,,Political Science,"Plan of Attack is the definitive account of how and why President George W. Bush, his war council, and allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein and occupy Iraq. Bob Woodward's latest landmark account of Washington decision making provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes and consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam. Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, Plan of Attack is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details and the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; and part a harrowing spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6,000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization. What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and the Oval Office, and in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused and driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted and cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; George Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane and demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee and national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff and congressional leadership; and foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin.

Vaughan has displayed an understanding of both the cost of survival and the political nuances of the modern world.

Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation – can it be given or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity?

Proganjan od policije radi političkih uvjerenja i razočaran recepcijom svojih futurističko-avangardnih pjesama i priča, Bruno Jasieński 1925. odlazi u Pariz gdje četiri godine živi u bijedi i na rubu gladi.

A onda slijedi naoko zbunjujući obrat, ali i, rekli bismo, priča tipična za eru staljinizma: Jasieński počinje stvarati na ruskom jeziku te postupno postaje socrealističkim piscem i jednim od glavnih propagatora režima, da bi na kraju skončao kao žrtva istog.

Under the unpublished title ""Memories of Glory"", the novel won a HarperCollins Top 5 Gold Medal award. Here are some of the reviewer's comments:  ""It is very difficult to approach a ‘coming of age’ story, and write in such a way as to not appear clichéd, but [the author] has made a remarkably strong case. In ‘Memories of Glory’, the journey from childhood to adulthood is dealt with in a unique way; the six children in Glory’s family are used to explore various different facets of growing up. The reader is also able to understand more about the pasts of Glory’s parents and their families, allowing adult tensions to be explored too. A compelling feminist take on life dominates, but the feelings of the important men in Glory’s life are not left uncovered. The memories she recalls do not depict a clear straightforward story, rather each is a part of a puzzle which in the end paints an often brutal but fair conclusion on life...Glory is set up well as a whimsical day-dreamer. She lives in an alter-world, and her intelligence and desire to be elsewhere helps build a strong picture of her imagination. Gradually it becomes clear that the world she fashions for herself is an escape from the harsh life that she has had to lead. As a protagonist she is wonderful; her suffering is a result of both her surroundings and of universal teenage trauma: I found her hugely accessible...The use of dialogue, and the focus on different characters in each recollection, allows the reader to build a strong concept of each family member, and their relationships with one another. This is a vibrant read, and no connection is left unexplored. Friendship, as well as sibling rivalry, is beautifully drawn out...The author clearly has a gift for wit and charm, illustrated in the passage where the family go blueberry picking...The role of “Mother Nature”, of fate and fortune, is an interesting theme and one that gives an interesting dimension to the family’s attitude.""",,,,May 15th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,B00KDHOP2Y,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421512578l/24547109.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,3.0,224,Westport River Publishing,[],,[],,['C.

  PRAGUE, 1870.
After joining the Order of the Crystal Daggers, led by her dauntless grandmother, Lady Penelope, Eleanora Svobodová set out to save her kingdom from oncoming devastation.And she failed. Following the attack on Prague Castle, Eleanora is determined to redeem herself. She sets out to win Karl’s trust while distancing herself from Ferdy, whose secrets and lies have done nothing to stop her from falling in love with him. As she struggles to let him go, questions about the mission and her mother’s past cause a rift between Amir and Lady Penelope and add to the growing discord between Eleanora and her brother. But when a cunning provocateur arrives in Prague, Eleanora discovers there is an even more deadly game afoot, one that reaches into Amir's past and threatens Lady Penelope's future. Now, the members of the Order must work together if they are to uncover the true enemy hiding in Bohemia. Can they work together despite their divisions? Or will their division lead to even more destruction? 
  
    
  

  FROM THE BOOK: 

  “How do I know you’re telling me the truth?” The last thing I wanted to do was hurt him, but if I did not find a way to break free of him, I would risk doing even more harm. Ferdy met my gaze with his. “I promise you this, Ella, that as of now, I will never lie to you again.” He leaned forward and kissed me again, and I stood there, letting him, desperately debating whether I could trust him or not. His promise burned through me, his words scorched into my being. It was so tempting to believe him, more tempting than anything else I had ever faced in all my life. Freedom was only freedom if I could trust it to be true.

Pitfall,,"['Thriller', 'Suspense']","Life has never been easy for former Army Ranger John Brenner. The wounded Iraqi war vet and ex-cop must rely on his wits, his fists, and a wry sense of gallows humor to make it through each challenging day. For at his core, this transplanted West Virginian is a throwback to an antebellum time: he is a southern man of honor.  But his latest mission may be his last.  The task seems straightforward—find industrialist Jacob Cahill’s missing teenage daughter Sarah and bring her safely home. But for John Brenner, nothing ever goes quite as planned. In searching for the girl he will discover a new and unimaginable corruption hiding beneath a corporate façade … and come face to face with a ruthless killer known to his victims only by a macabre appellation: Boneless Chuck.  What begins as a simple disappearance morphs into something far more insidious as John finds himself plunged into a horrifying world of organ harvesting, torture, mutilation, and madness. Every dark trick John learned in his former trade of dealing death to the deserving will be brought to bear as he tries to keep his promise of bringing the girl back alive. In doing so, not only will his skills be tested to the breaking point, but his very sanity as he battles a grasping evil that stretches across the globe.  But darkness has met its match. Because sometimes it takes a man who’s spent quality time in the realms of the damned … to send someone else there. So strap down and hang on.  John Brenner has just been dropped into hell.  From the book: “Son.” My voice degenerated to a guttural rasp. “Don’t make me kill you.” I was thinking of Sarah. She really didn’t need to have this added to her experience. I was asking for her sake. “Please.”  “Don’t beg, briar.” His reply didn’t even sound human. “It turns my gut. What’s about to happen, you can’t stop it. Nobody’s that good.”  I held my mark.  Still smiling, his knuckle grew white as it tightened down on the Glock’s trigger, taking up the last half-ounce of slack as his eyes flickered his intent. Sarah moaned in fear.  And then everything stopped as my Browning roared, its round rocketing six feet across the room and straight into his open blue eye.  The bullet mushroomed as it hit, growing instantly from the size of a pea to the diameter of a gumdrop. That’s what hollow points do. As the round exited his head at that short distance the entire back of his skull vanished in a spray of pink and gray, his gun flying free and unfired from his limp hand as he slumped to the floor, deader than four o’clock.  “I am, Albert,” I whispered to his still form. “I’m that good.”  And then Sarah started screaming again.",,,,July 25th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,9781942266198,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438093995l/25997563._SY475_.jpg,4.11,[],88.0,1.0,,,,94.0,63.0,332,WildBlue Press,"['26', '24', '9', '2', '2']",,[],,['Cameron Bane']

Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Nature', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Popular Science', 'Animals', 'Evolution', 'Health']","For centuries, parasites have lived in nightmares, horror stories, and in the darkest shadows of science. Now award-winning writer Carl Zimmer takes us on a fantastic voyage into the secret parasite universe we actually live in but haven't recognized. He reveals not only that parasites are the most successful life-forms on Earth, but that they triggered the development of sex, shape ecosystems, and have driven the engine of evolution. In mapping the parasite universe, Zimmer makes the astonishing observation that most species are parasites, and that almost every animal, including humans, will at one time or another become the home of a parasite. Zimmer shows how highly evolved parasites are and describes the frightening and amazing ingenuity these commando invaders use to devour their hosts from the inside and control their behavior. The sinister Sacculina carcini makes its home in an unlucky crab and proceeds to eat everything but what the crab needs to put food in its mouth, which Sacculina then consumes. When Sacculina finally reproduces, it places its young precisely where the crab would nurture its own progeny, and then has the crab nurture the foster family members. Single-celled Toxoplasma gondi has an even more insidious role, for it can invade the human brain. There it makes men distrustful and less willing to submit to social mores. Women become more outgoing and warm-hearted. Why would a parasite cause these particular personality changes? It seems Toxoplasma wants its host to be less afraid, to be more prone to danger and a violent end -- so that, in the carnage, it will be able to move on to another host. From the steamy jungles of Costa Rica to the fetid parasite heaven of rebel-held southern Sudan, Zimmer tracks the genius of parasitic life and its impact on humanity. We hosts have developed remarkable defenses against the indomitable parasite: our mighty immune system, our culturally enforced habit of keeping clean, and, perhaps most intriguingly, sex. But this is not merely a book about the evil power of parasitism and how we must defend against it. On the contrary, Zimmer concludes that humankind itself is a new kind of parasite, one that preys on the entire Earth. If we are to achieve the sophistication of the parasites on display here in vivid detail, if we are to promote the flourishing of life in all its diversity as they do, we must learn the ways nature lives with itself, the laws of Parasite Rex.",,With a New Epilogue,01/01/00,November 9th 2014,[],Paperback,,9780743200110,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390166830l/815394.jpg,4.2,[],94.0,1.0,,,,95.0,4779.0,306,Atria Books,"['2159', '1691', '704', '157', '68']",,[],,['Carl Zimmer']

Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction,,Philosophy,"This is a book about the invention of Western philosophy, and the first thinkers to explore ideas about the nature of reality, time, and the origin of the universe. It begins with the finding of the new papyrus fragment of Empedocles' poem, and uses the story of its discovery and interpretation to highlight the way our understanding of early philosophers is marked by their presentation in later sources. Generations of philosophers, both ancient and modern, have traced their inspiration back to the presocratics, even though we have very few of their writings left. In this book, Catherine Osborne invites her readers to dip their toes into the fragmentary remains of thinkers from Thales to Pythagoras, Heraclitus to Protagoras, to try to fill in the bits of a jigsaw that has been rejigged many times and in many different ways.

Between life and death, dreaming and waking, at the train stop beyond the end of the world is the city of Palimpsest. To get there is a miracle, a mystery, a gift, and a curse—a voyage permitted only to those who’ve always believed there’s another world than the one that meets the eye.

The story begins with our hero bravely striking out on his own for the first time, leaving his mother's house to apply for his dream job as a cautionary writer for the Safely-Now Corporation. In the process, he uncovers an unreal world of secret societies, benevolent families, and bureaucratic security.

These were among the earliest versions of some of our most familiar fairy tales (""Cinderella,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" ""Puss in Boots,"" and ""Tom Thumb"") and are still among the few classic re-tellings of these perennial stories.In addition to the five well-known tales listed above, Perrault tells three others that are sure to delight any child or adult: ""The Fairies,"" a short and very simple tale of two sisters, one sweet and one spiteful; ""Ricky of the Tuft,"" a very unusual story of a brilliant but ugly prince and a beautiful but stupid princess; and ""Blue Beard,"" a suspense story perhaps more famous as a classic thriller than as a fairy tale. The witty verse morals that Perrault included in the original edition (often omitted in later reprintings) are retained here in verse translations.This edition also includes 34 extraordinary full-page engravings by Gustave Doré that show clearly why this artist became the foremost illustrator of his time. These illustrations have long been considered the ideal accompaniment to Perrault's fairy tales. In many cases they created the pictorial image that we associate with the stories.Along with the collections of Andersen, Lang, and the Brothers Grimm, this volume is among the great books of European fairy tales.

Pinktoes: A Novel,,"['Fiction', 'African American', 'Novels']","Pinktoes, Chester Himes said, is a term of indulgent affection applied to white women by Negro men, and sometimes conversely by Negro women to white men, but never adversely by either. In this rowdy work of fiction that debunks self-satisfied do-gooders, Himes satirizes social missionaries who preach uplift and promote specious causes. With Rabelaisian zest he portrays Mamie Mason, Harlem's most influential society matron, hosting desegregated sexual orgies, all for the advancement of harmony between the races. Just as eager as Mamie to bask in the favorable light of social justice are liberal whites who wish to be seen amid the right people.

And as the battle between good and evil came into each home, all God's children had to chose which side they were on, which principles would they fight for, and what price would they pay.In this contest before the Great War, each of us learned the first lessons of life.

Peter: The Untold True Story,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Retellings', 'Fairy Tales', 'Adventure', 'Adult', 'Historical Fantasy']","Chris Mechling's new historical novel, Peter, introduces readers to the amazing true story behind the fairy tale of Peter Pan. The book tells the adventures of the real boy who came to London and became a well-known figure more than a hundred years before James Barrie penned his classic. Peter the Wild Boy lived in eighteenth century England, through the reigns of three kings (all named George), and achieved legendary status in his own lifetime. He was not only a popular figure, but also drew intense philosophical and scientific study, and was a subject of interest to literary figures such as Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift. Peter retained a youthful appearance throughout his life, and had a joyful, intuitive spirit that was both challenging and infectious. This imaginative dramatization of the life of Peter the Wild Boy captures the joy, innocence and fire of a bright, feral child living in the midst of the Age of Enlightenment. It is narrated by the girl who perhaps knew him best. The epic story of his life, spanning approximately seventy years, navigates a tumultuous and thoughtful period in English history, rich with characters. Peter is a magical, poignant tale full of humor, love, and courage in the face of life's difficulties.

Paralyzed by his first glimpse of the Grail, Perceval fails to save the ailing king. Distraught, the knight begins a new quest for the Grail, a journey on the road of penitence and faith.

But as the huge sum of cash is stolen, so too is one man's heart -- and that man is the Prince of Thieves...Charlestown, a blue-collar Boston neighborhood, produces more bank robbers and armored car thieves than any square mile in the world.

Meanwhile, Doug's crew pulls off another audacious, meticulously planned job. Frustrated by their ingenuity and brazen ambition, FBI Agent Adam Frawley begins to zero in on Doug and his pals -- and against his own better judgment, he, too, develops more than a professional interest in Claire.Under pressure from Frawley's ever-closer investigation, Doug imagines a life for himself away from bank robberies and Charlestown.

Who is mad? Who is sane? Who decides? Welcome to the Dorothy Fish, a day hospital in North London. N has been a patient here for thirteen years. Day after day she sits smoking in the common room, swapping medication and comparing MAD money rates. Like all the patients at the Dorothy Fish, N's chief ambition is never to get discharged. Each year, when her annual assessment comes round, she is relieved to learn that she hasn't got any better. Then in walks Poppy Shakespeare in her six-inch skirt and twelve-inch heels. She is certain she isn't mentally ill and desperate to return to her life outside. Though baffled by Poppy's attitude, N agrees to help. Together they plot to gain Poppy's freedom. But in a world where everything's upside-down, are they crazy enough to upset the system? Funny, brilliant, and moving, Poppy Shakespeare looks at madness from the inside, questioning our mental health system and the borders we place between sanity and insanity. Written in high-voltage prose, original and troubling, it is a stunning debut. Excerpt from Poppy Shakespeare: ""'It's not that I've got a problem with mental illness, ' Poppy said.

Prep,,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Boarding School', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Realistic Fiction']","Curtis Sittenfeld’s debut novel, Prep, is an insightful, achingly funny coming-of-age story as well as a brilliant dissection of class, race, and gender in a hothouse of adolescent angst and ambition.Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off in front of her dorm at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school’s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel. As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of–and, ultimately, a participant in–their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she’s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.Ultimately, Lee’s experiences–complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/17/05,November 22nd 2005,"['Lee Fiora', 'Cross Sugarman', 'Martha Porter', 'Aspeth Montgomery', 'Dede Schwartz', 'Sin Jun', 'Conchita Maxwell', 'David Bardo', 'Aubrey']",Paperback,,9780812972351,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925666l/9844.jpg,3.39,['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2006)'],1177.0,15.0,,,,80.0,60735.0,420,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['9994', '19011', '19841', '8553', '3336']",,"['Massachusetts (United States)', 'South Bend, Indiana (United States)']",,['Curtis Sittenfeld']

We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we?In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same ""types"" of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us ""predictably"" irrational.From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions.

So when his superiors offer him an unusually large financial package to supervise the rebuilding of the nuclear plant, he convinces his wife to forestall their retirement and pick up where they left off many years earlier in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Passionate Minds,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'France', '18th Century', 'History Of Science', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']","It was 1733 when the poet and philosopher Voltaire met Emilie du Châtelet, a beguiling—and married—aristocrat who would one day popularize Newton’s arcane ideas and pave the way for Einstein’s theories. In an era when women were rarely permitted any serious schooling, this twenty-seven-year-old’s nimble conversation and unusual brilliance led Voltaire, then in his late thirties, to wonder, “Why did you only reach me so late?” They fell immediately and passionately in love.Through the prism of their tumultuous fifteen-year relationship we see the crumbling of an ancient social order and the birth of the Enlightenment. Together the two lovers rebuilt a dilapidated and isolated rural chateau at Cirey where they conducted scientific experiments, entertained many of the leading thinkers of the burgeoning scientific revolution, and developed radical ideas about the monarchy, the nature of free will, the subordination of women, and the separation of church and state. But their time together was filled with far more than reading and intellectual conversation. There were frantic gallopings across France, sword fights in front of besieged German fortresses, and a deadly burning of Voltaire’s books by the public executioner at the base of the grand stairwell of the Palais de Justice in Paris. The pair survived court intrigues at Versailles, narrow escapes from agents of the king, a covert mission to the idyllic lakeside retreat of Frederick the Great of Prussia, forays to the royal gambling tables (where Emilie put her mathematical acumen to lucrative use), and intense affairs that bent but did not break their bond.Along with its riveting portrait of Voltaire as a vulnerable romantic, Passionate Minds at last does justice to the supremely unconventional life and remarkable achievements of Emilie du Châtelet—including her work on the science of fire and the nature of light. Long overlooked, her story tells us much about women’s lives at the time of the Enlightenment. Equally important, it demonstrates how this graceful, quick-witted, and attractive woman worked out the concepts that would lead directly to the “squared” part of Einstein’s revolutionary equation: E=mc2.Based on a rich array of personal letters, as well as writings from houseguests, neighbors, scientists, and even police reports, Passionate Minds is both panoramic and intimate in feeling. It is an unforgettable love story and a vivid rendering of the birth of modern ideas.",,,11/06/06,October 10th 2006,"['Voltaire', 'Émilie du Châtelet']",Hardcover,,9780307237200,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358628810l/2804.jpg,4.1,[],71.0,1.0,,,,95.0,961.0,373,Crown Publishing Group (NY),"['366', '382', '165', '37', '11']",,[],,['David Bodanis']
Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Reference', 'Dinosaurs', 'Evolution', 'Prehistory', 'Animals', 'Palaeontology', 'Biology']","With an extensive catalog at its heart, Prehistoric Life profiles hundreds of fascinating species in incredible detail. The story starts in earnest 3.8 billion years ago, with the earliest-known form of life on Earth, a bacteria that still exists today, and journeys through action-packed millennia, charting the appearance of new life forms as well as devastating extinction events. Of course, the ever-popular and endlessly intriguing dinosaurs feature large, but Prehistoric Life gives you the whole picture, and the plants, invertebrates, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals that are the ancestors of today's species also populate its pages, making this book unprecedented in its coverage of prehistory. Specially commissioned artworks use cutting-edge technology to render species in breathtakingly realistic fashion, with astonishing images of prehistoric remains, such as skeletons and fossils, to complete the story. To put all the evidence in context, the concept of geological time is explored, as is the classification of species and how the evidence for their evolution is preserved and can be deciphered.New technologies have brought new life to inanimate fossils. CT scanning, for example, unlocks a 3D image of a plant or animal from a piece of rock, which can then be viewed from all angles revealing never-before-seen details. From this researchers can fill in missing pieces and even simulate how an animal might have moved. Panels explore these and numerous other scientific techniques for recovering, dating, and reconstructing, as well as profiling individuals, key excavations and discoveries, and some of the unique anatomical features that nature has developed over the course of time.The last section of the book looks at the development of humans and the eventual rise to dominance of Homo sapiens, exploring not only their changing anatomy as revealed by the fossils but also the evidence for culture and society as evidenced by extraordinary cave paintings and intricately worked tools.In combination, the stunning visuals, captivating, authoritative text, and comprehensive approach make Prehistoric Life a fascinating and revealing encyclopedia that will appeal to the whole family.TABLE OF CONTENTS1.

David Holmgren brings into sharper focus the powerful and still evolving Permaculture concept he pioneered with Bill Mollison in the 1970s. It draws together and integrates 25 years of thinking and teaching to reveal a whole new way of understanding and action behind a simple set of design principles. The 12 design principles are each represented by a positive action statement, an icon and a traditional proverb or two that captures the essence of each principle.Holmgren draws a correlation between every aspect of how we organize our lives, communities and landscapes and our ability to creatively adapt to the ecological realities that shape human destiny. For students and teachers of Permaculture this book provides something more fundamental and distilled than Mollison's encyclopedic ""Designers Manual."" For the general reader it provides refreshing perspectives on a range of environmental issues and shows how permaculture is much more than just a system of gardening.

Prisoner of the Vatican: The Popes' Secret Plot to Capture Rome from the New Italian State,,"['History', 'Religion', 'Italy', 'Nonfiction', 'European History', 'Audiobook', 'Church History', 'Christianity']","We think of Italy as an ancient nation, but in fact the unified Italian state was born only in the nineteenth century — and only against the adamant refusal of the pope to relinquish his rule of Rome. In this riveting chronicle of international intrigue, the renowned historian David Kertzer delves into secret Vatican archives to reveal a venomous conflict that kept the pope a self-imposed prisoner of the Vatican for more than fifty years. King Victor Emmanuel, his nemesis Garibaldi, the French emperor Napoleon III, England, Spain, Germany, Austria, and even America play a part in this astonishing drama. On September 20, 1870, the king's battle to unite the disparate Italian states came to a head when his troops broke through the walls of Rome, which the pope had ruled for centuries. Pope Pius IX, ensconced with the Vatican Council, denounced the usurpers and plotted with his advisers to regain power or else flee Italy altogether. A dramatic struggle unfolded over the next two decades, pitting church against state and the nations of Europe against one another. This is a story of outrageous accusations, mutual denunciations, raucous demonstrations, frenetic diplomacy, and secret dealings. Rocks were hurled along with epithets, and war across Europe seemed inevitable. The antagonists were as explosive as the events. Pius IX, the most important pontiff in modern history, engineered the doctrine of papal infallibility but ended his days reviled and denounced. The blustering Victor Emmanuel schemed behind the backs of his own ministers. Garibaldi, Italy's dashing national hero, committed naive and dangerous mistakes. Beyond Italy, the pope’s main protector, Napoleon III, was himself being taken prisoner. This devastating conflict, almost entirely unknown until now, still leaves a deep mark on the Italian soul.

"Polska... rivemo!: Sete bici, do veci, un cocal e una cornacia",,[],"Il libro, scritto interamente in dialetto triestino, è diviso in tre sezioni che si alternano. La prima racconta il viaggio in bicicletta di sette ragazzi triestini da Trieste a Cracovia, in dodici tappe. Al termine di ogni tappa, due anziani triestini, ispirati dagli avvenimenti accaduti ai ragazzi durante la giornata, raccontano al lettore un aneddoto dei loro tempi, sul modello delle famose Maldobrie di Carpinteri & Faraguna. Questa doppia linea di narrazione permette al libro di presentare due tipi di dialetto, uno “più giovane”, usato nel ciclodiario in prima persona, e uno più “anziano”, usato nel raccontare gli aneddoti degli anziani in forma di dialogo. Uno degli obbiettivi del libro è infatti quello di voler illustrare l'evoluzione del dialetto triestino tra le diverse fasce di età della popolazione. Una terza parte è dedicata al fumetto, e vede protagonisti un gabbiano e una cornacchia che, parlandosi in dialetto, intervalleranno la narrazione con goffi tentativi di furto di cibo ai danni dei due anziani, usando nel loro vocabolario espressioni e modi di dire tipici della tradizione triestina.Il libro si è classificato al secondo posto nel Concorso Nazionale Salva la tua lingua locale, dedicato ai dialetti di tutta Italia.",Ciclomaldobrie #2,,,May 8th 2013,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395339613l/21523308.jpg,3.88,[],100.0,1.0,,,,75.0,8.0,218,Bora.La,"['4', '1', '1', '2', '0']",,[],,"['Diego Manna', 'Michele Zazzara']"

Her sassy, super-chatty assistant, Monkey, is ready to help Princess Lizzie, as is her sensible pal Giraffe.But who is the mysterious creature that dwells just outside the Royal grounds—and is it a friend or foe? And just who is the blind mouse that seems to be able to do just about anything? As young readers become enthralled in the intriguing new characters and the story’s many surprises, they will also be moved by the princess’s uncommon bravery, empathy, and intelligence. At the same time, the Princess Lizzie series exposes them to topics that are not frequently covered in children’s books, such as Princess Lizzie’s dilemma over whether to help out a friend if it means breaking the rules of the kingdom.In addition, Princess Lizzie also demonstrates that being pretty special does not mean that a child needs to be perfect. Each child may confront struggles or weaknesses, but by focusing on his or her strengths, marvelous, magical things are sure to take place. Just follow Princess Lizzie’s shining example. When you do, you are bound to discover life lessons, while having a rollicking good time.By putting their brains together, and tapping into the latest technology, the three friends prove that anything is possible when you have the confidence and support to solve perplexing problems. Young children will hang on every twist in the plot, and along the way learn the power of friendship, caring for those less fortunate, and making use of wits and innovation to save the day!

Plants And Landscapes For Summer-dry Climates Of The San Francisco Bay Region,,Gardening,"Gardening. Environmental Studies. Photographs by Saxon Holt. Illustrations by Richard Pembroke. This lavishly illustrated book celebrates the challenges and opportunities of gardening in Mediterranean climates, with special reference to northern California's San Francisco Bay Region. The core of the book is a catalog of more than 650 plants suited to regions with mild, usually wet winters and dry, often hot summers. These plants thrive with moderate to no summer irrigation when established, require little or no maintenance, and are reasonably available from nurseries, botanic gardens, native plant sales, or specialty seed suppliers. Many of the 542 color photographs show plants in garden settings to suggest attractive and compatible plant combinations. Summary charts provide information on each plant, such as bloom time, needs for water and sun, and preferences for coastal or inland microclimates. Lists suggest plants for special situations, such as hot sites, dryish shade, small gardens, and clay soils. Chapters on landscape design and maintenance inspire readers to make gardens that use little water and no harmful chemicals, with a focus on building healthy soil. Practical steps to successful design are supplemented with ideas for designing with microclimate, attracting wildlife, and fire safety. Sidebars by local experts discuss weather, natural landscapes, design solutions, and gardening with recycled water. ""A valuable resource for climate-compatible gardening in the San Franciso Bay Area that will also be of interest to gardeners in other parts of the world with a similar seasonal pattern of winter rain and dry summers. This book will occupy a prominent place in my library for many years to come.""—Katherine Greenberg, president Mediterranean Garden Society ""This book is beautifully designed with abundant photographs of plants, many in garden settings, and it is packed with the kind of information gardeners need for their own special situations.

Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife,,"['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Science', 'Christian', 'Inspirational', 'Medical', 'Faith']","Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander’s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion—and in essence makes us human—shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander’s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander’s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.Alexander’s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

Poems Between Women,"Four Centuries of Love, Romantic Friendship, and Desire",Poetry,"The collection Poems Between Women explores many facets of female-female relationships in poems not only about love or affection between or inspired by women but also about the moments that complicate and call into question the nature of sexuality and intimacy between women. Including women married and single, young and old, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual, the anthology covers historical development and changing mores through the seventeenth century, after the Restoration of Charles II, a time of relative freedom for women; the eighteenth century, when the cult of romantic friendship reached its peak; the nineteenth century, when women writers wrote about issues of same-sex desire indirectly and explored complex issues such as death in tones of weariness and resignation; and the twentieth century, when poets began to engage in more overt explorations of women's bodies, sensuality, and lovemaking. Emma Donoghue's introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women's poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures. Poems Between Women is testimony not only to the recurring theme of the unique bonds among women but also to the universality of love, friendship, and creativity.",,,,1999.0,,,0231109253,9780231109253,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d_1dqrZtllwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.86,,,,,,,,,256.0,,,66.0,,,['Emma Donoghue']

Poor Fool,,['Fiction'],"Published in 1930, Poor Fool was Erskine Caldwell's second novel. Like most of his fiction, it revolves around a gallery of grotesque characters motivated by the basest urges. The novel's central figure is Blondy Niles, a down-and-out boxer who exists at the very fringes of society. The garish nighttime world of bars and prostitutes, con men and petty crimes is the milieu in which he moves. When he is approached by Salty Banks to be an unwitting fall guy in a rigged boxing scheme, a calamitous chain of events is set in motion, and death is the inevitable result. Blondy is befriended by a good-hearted prostitute, Louise, but then comes under the powerful, mysterious spell of the gruesome Mrs. Boxx, an enormous, soulless woman who lures him to her house, which has been converted into the most primitive of abortion mills. Despite the terrible acts Mrs. Boxx oversees and that Blondy is compelled to participate in, he inexplicably finds himself unable - or unwilling - to leave this chamber of horror. Only with the help of Dorothy, Mrs. Boxx's younger, daughter, does he finally free himself from the clutches of this demonic, madwoman. Yet freedom proves elusive, for by the end of this surreal, phantasmagoric adventure, Blondy and everyone he cares for have come to a bloody end. Caldwell himself likened Poor Fool to a ""diabolical dream."" Written early in his career, it foreshadows many of the themes that were to characterize his later novels.",,,1930,October 1st 1994,[],Paperback,,9780807119471,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349025010l/970761.jpg,3.74,[],23.0,1.0,,,,85.0,46.0,131,Louisiana State University Press,"['14', '15', '10', '5', '2']",,[],,['Erskine Caldwell']

Pornography: The Other Side,,[],"A unique and important book. I have never read any work which analyzes the subject in such a manner. This book is more thorough and has a more liberated point of view than others which attempt to tackle this `hot potato' of the 1980s. Men should read this book. Women should read this book.Karen DeCrow, former President, NOWThis study slices like a laser through all the fog of rhetoric, disinformation, bias, and fear that has long enveloped all discussions of the subject of pornography in the US. No argument in favor of the censorship of such material can be considered valid unless the basic arguments of this study are answered. . . . This is a valuable resource for all academic libraries and could well become a fundamental weapon in the war to preserve the First Amendment. This book should be purchased by all but the smallest libraries; it may well be the most honest discussion of the subject ever written. ChoiceIn the continuing debate over pornography, two arguments stand out: that it is evil and should be censored, or that it is evil but censorship is a greater evil. F. M. Christensen presents the other side of this debate in what will surely be one of the most controversial books on the subject. Pornography: The Other Side convincingly argues that anti-pornography campaigns are themselves morally evil. The author defends this startling claim with a scientific persuasiveness. He successfully opens the pornography debate to include the whole picture, allowing the reader to grasp another side to this ongoing debate with concise, practical arguments. Students and scholars of all the social sciences, as well as the informed general reader, will find Pornography: The Other Side a source of stimulating ideas.Christensen concludes that pornography itself is not the fundamental issue for those who oppose it. Vehement opposition to pornography, according to this book, is a symptom of tragically mistaken beliefs about sex. What this book is really about, writes the author, is sex--and the evil effects on the lives of all of us which irrational attitudes toward that subject continue to have.",,,05/01/90,May 7th 1990,[],Paperback,,9780313360572,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347368571l/6850757.jpg,0.0,[],47.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,188,Praeger Publishers,[],,[],,['F.

And one of the fascinating figures of all literature, with his manifold identities, his amazing audacities, his brilliance and his shyness. I think I have under control the reluctance I feel in having to share Pessoa with the public he should have had all along in America: until now, only the poets, so far as I can tell, have even heard of him, and delighted and exulted in him. He is, in some ways, the poet of modernism, the only one willing to fracture himself into the parcels of action, anguish, and nostalgia which are the grounds of our actual situation."" —C. K. Williams""Pessoa is one of the great originals (a fact rendered more striking by his writing as several distinct personalities) of the European poetry of the first part of this century, and has been one of the last poets of comparable stature, in the European languages, to become known in English. Edwin Honig's translations of Spanish and Portuguese poetry have been known to anyone who cares about either, since his work on Lorca in the forties, and his Selected Poems of Pessoa (1971) was a welcome step toward a long-awaited larger colection."" — W. S. Merwin""Fernando Pessoa is the least known of the masters of the twentieth-century poetry. From his heteronymic passion he produced, if that is the word, two of our greatest poets, Alberto Caeiro and Álvaro de Campos, and a third, Ricardo Reis, who isn't bad. Pessoa is the exemplary poet of the self as other, of the poem as testament to unreality, proclamation of nothingness, occasion for expectancy. In Edwin Honig's and Susan Brown's superb translations, Pessoa and his ""others"" live with miraculous style and vitality."" —Mark StrandFernando Pessoa is Portugal’s most important contemporary poet. He wrote under several identities, which he called heteronyms: Albet Caeiro, Alvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, and Bernardo Soares. He wrote sublime poetry under his own name as well, and each of his “voices” is completely different in subject, temperament, and style.

Poemas de Álvaro de Campos (Obra Poética IV),,"['Poetry', 'Portugal', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Fiction', '20th Century', 'Philosophy']","Em 8 de março de 1914, aos 25 anos de idade, o poeta português Fernando Pessoa teve um insight e, naquilo que ele chamaria mais tarde de 'dia triunfal', criou seus três principais heterônimos, Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis e Álvaro de Campos. Deu-lhes, além do nome, uma biografia, um biotipo e, sobretudo, uma obra e um estilo poético únicos. Trata-se do único caso de heteronímia de toda história da literatura universal. Álvaro de Campos era, segundo Pessoa, 'o mais histericamente histérico de mim', era engenheiro, usava monóculo, e o poeta escrevia sob o seu nome quando sentia um súbito impulso de escrever não sei o quê. Campos é o heterônimo da modernidade, da euforia, da irreverência total a tudo e a todos, cultuador da liberdade, sedento por experimentar todas as sensações a um só tempo e profundamente influenciado por Walt Whitman. De sua lavra são os célebres versos de 'Opiário', 'Ode trinfual', 'Lisbon revisited' e 'Tabacaria' - este último considerado dos mais belos poemas da língua portuguesa.",,,03/01/30,Published,[],,,9788525415929,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1271789085l/8070004.jpg,4.56,[],100.0,1.0,,,,98.0,1737.0,336,L&PM,"['1167', '418', '123', '20', '9']",,[],,"['Fernando Pessoa', 'Álvaro de Campos']"

Buvo įprasta teigti, esą gyvūnai turi tik instinktus. Olandų etologas ir zoologas Fransas de Waalas (gim. 1948), keturis dešimtmečius tyrinėjęs gyvūnų elgesį, atskleidžia, kad visoms primatų rūšims būdingos panašios emocijos, – ir žmogus čia niekuo ne išskirtinis.Knyga pradedama nuo matriarchės šimpanzės vardu Mama istorijos. Jaudinančiame epizode aprašoma, kaip pas sergančią Mamą atsisveikinti ateina 40 metų ją pažinojęs mokslininkas. Senutė šimpanzė staiga atsisėda, nusišypso, jį apkabina ir su begaliniu švelnumu ima glostyti jam galvą.De Waalas gyvūnus stebi su meile, bet jų nesužmogina.

Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit,,"['Philosophy', 'History', 'Theory']","This is a new translation, with running commentary, of what is perhaps the most important short piece of Hegel's writing. The Preface to Hegel's first major work, the Phenomenology of Spirit, lays the groundwork for all his other writing by explaining what is most innovative about Hegel's philosophy.This new translation combines readability with maximum precision, breaking Hegel's long sentences and simplifying their often complex structure. At the same time, it is more faithful to the original than any previous translation.The heart of the book is the detailed commentary, supported by an introductory essay. Together they offer a lucid and elegant explanation of the text and elucidate difficult issues in Hegel, making his claims and intentions intelligible to the beginner while offering interesting and original insights to the scholar and advanced student. The commentary often goes beyond the particular phrase in the text to provide systematic context and explain related topics in Hegel and his predecessors (including Kant, Spinoza, and Aristotle, as well as Fichte, Schelling, Holderlin, and others).The commentator refrains from playing down (as many interpreters do today) those aspects of Hegel's thought that are less acceptable in our time, and abstains from mixing his own philosophical preferences with his reading of Hegel's text.

An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system. In Shaw's clever adaptation, Professor Henry Higgins, a linguistic expert, takes on a bet that he can transform an awkward cockney flower seller into a refined young lady simply by polishing her manners and changing the way she speaks. In the process of convincing society that his creation is a mysterious royal figure, the Professor also falls in love with his elegant handiwork.The irresistible theme of the emerging butterfly, together with Shaw's brilliant dialogue and splendid skills as a playwright, have made Pygmalion one of the most popular comedies in the English language.

Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Hailed as “a Tolstoy with jokes” by one critic, George Bernard Shaw was the most significant British playwright since the seventeenth century. Pygmalion persists as his best-loved play, one made into both a classic film—which won Shaw an Academy Award for best screenplay—and the perennially popular musical My Fair Lady.Pygmalion follows the adventures of phonetics professor Henry Higgins as he attempts to transform cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle into a refined lady. The scene in which Eliza appears in high society with the correct accent but no notion of polite conversation is considered one of the funniest in English drama. Like most of Shaw’s work, Pygmalion wins over audiences with wit, a taut morality, and an innate understanding of human relationships.This volume also includes Major Barbara, which attacks both capitalism and charitable organizations, The Doctor’s Dilemma, a keen-eyed examination of medical morals and malpractice, and Heartbreak House, which exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the bloodshed of World War I.John A.

"Play Their Hearts Out: A Coach, His Star Recruit, and the Youth Basketball Machine",,"['Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'Basketball', 'Biography', 'History', 'High School', 'American', 'Sociology']","Eight years of unfettered access, a keen sense of a story’s deepest truths, and a genuine compassion for his subject allow Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist George Dohrmann to take readers inside the machine that produces America’s basketball stars.    Hoop dreams aren’t just for players. The fever that grips college basketball prospects hoping to strike big-time NBA gold afflicts coaches, parents, and sneaker executives as well. Every one of them has a stake in keeping America’s wildly dysfunctional, incredibly lucrative youth basketball machine up and running—no matter the consequences. In Play Their Hearts Out, George Dohrmann offers an up-close and unforgettable look inside the maw of that machine. He shares what he learned from his years spent embedded with a group of talented young recruits from Southern California as they traveled the country playing in elite Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) events. It’s a cutthroat world where boys as young as eight or nine are subjected to a dizzying torrent of scrutiny and exploitation. Coaches vie to have them on their teams. Sneaker companies ply them with free shoes and gear. “All-star camps” are glorified cattle auctions, providing make-or-break opportunities to secure the promise of an elusive college scholarship.    At the book’s heart are the personal stories of two compelling figures: Joe Keller, an ambitious AAU coach with a master plan to find and promote “the next LeBron”—thereby paving his own path to power and riches; and Demetrius Walker, a fatherless latchkey kid who falls under Keller’s sway and struggles to live up to the unrealistic expectations his supposed benefactor has set for him. As their fortunes take shape and the pressure mounts—Demetrius finds himself profiled in Sports Illustrated at age fourteen, while Keller cultivates his business empire—Dohrmann weaves in the stories of numerous other parents, coaches, and players. Some of them see their prospects evaporate as a result of poor decisions and worse luck. Others learn how to thrive in a corrupt system by playing the right angles. Written with incomparable detail and insight, Play Their Hearts Out is a thoroughly unique narrative that reveals the inner workings of an American game, exposing the gritty reality that lies beneath so many dreams of fame and glory.",,,October 5th 2009,October 5th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780345508607,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320501257l/8124176.jpg,4.21,['PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing (2011)'],39.0,1.0,,,,94.0,4201.0,432,Ballantine Books,"['2153', '1170', '606', '172', '100']",,[],,['George Dohrmann']
Philosophy In The Flesh,,Philosophy,"What are human beings like? How is knowledge possible? What is truth? Where do moral values come from? Questions like these have stood at the center of Western philosophy for centuries. In addressing them, philosophers have made certain fundamental assumptions-that we can know our own minds by introspection, that most of our thinking about the world is literal, and that reason is disembodied and universal-that are now called into question by well-established results of cognitive science. It has been shown empirically that:Most thought is unconscious. We have no direct conscious access to the mechanisms of thought and language. Our ideas go by too quickly and at too deep a level for us to observe them in any simple way.Abstract concepts are mostly metaphorical. Much of the subject matter of philosopy, such as the nature of time, morality, causation, the mind, and the self, relies heavily on basic metaphors derived from bodily experience. What is literal in our reasoning about such concepts is minimal and conceptually impoverished. All the richness comes from metaphor. For instance, we have two mutually incompatible metaphors for time, both of which represent it as movement through space: in one it is a flow past us and in the other a spatial dimension we move along.Mind is embodied. Thought requires a body-not in the trivial sense that you need a physical brain to think with, but in the profound sense that the very structure of our thoughts comes from the nature of the body. Nearly all of our unconscious metaphors are based on common bodily experiences.Most of the central themes of the Western philosophical tradition are called into question by these findings. The Cartesian person, with a mind wholly separate from the body, does not exist. The Kantian person, capable of moral action according to the dictates of a universal reason, does not exist. The phenomenological person, capable of knowing his or her mind entirely through introspection alone, does not exist. The utilitarian person, the Chomskian person, the poststructuralist person, the computational person, and the person defined by analytic philosopy all do not exist.Then what does?Lakoff and Johnson show that a philosopy responsible to the science of mind offers radically new and detailed understandings of what a person is. After first describing the philosophical stance that must follow from taking cognitive science seriously, they re-examine the basic concepts of the mind, time, causation, morality, and the self: then they rethink a host of philosophical traditions, from the classical Greeks through Kantian morality through modern analytic philosopy. They reveal the metaphorical structure underlying each mode of thought and show how the metaphysics of each theory flows from its metaphors. Finally, they take on two major issues of twentieth-century philosopy: how we conceive rationality, and how we conceive language.",,,,1999.0,,,0465056741,9780465056743,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=csAStAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.07,,,,,,,,,640.0,,,1100.0,,,['George Lakoff']
Procrastination: How To Stop Wasting Your Time And Be More Productive,,[],"Use These Powerful Techniques To Stop Wasting Your Time And Be More ProductiveThis book contains proven steps and strategies. It is a simple guide on how to cure laziness, set goals, improve discipline, control your habits, and end procrastinating. Procrastination is quite a menace primarily because it makes you squander time and disregard its importance. The dilemma is that procrastination is something that comes easily to many of us. And it is a problem that does interfere with our routine chores, performance, and productivity. Studies show that about 25% to 75% of college students are prone to procrastination when it comes to doing their academic work. Procrastination is a major reason why, often, PhD students fail to complete their university dissertations on time. While these statistics pertain to only academics, the truth is that procrastination does get in the way of our routine household chores, personal obligations, and even relationships. Many times, we find ourselves preferring to snuggle in bed over meeting a friend or binge-watching movies instead of doing errands. One way or another, procrastination does influence your life and that too, negatively. So how is it that you can get better control of it and learn to overcome this unhealthy habit? Well, that is the focus of this guide. This book gives you a better understanding of the problem at hand, ‘procrastination,’ and provides you with actionable and effective guidelines on how to control your bad habits, inculcate self-discipline, manage your temptations, set meaningful goals and achieve them with utmost focus and determination.Here Is A Preview Of What You Will Learn

Lewis said that upon reading this astonishing 19th-century fairy tale he ""had crossed a great frontier,"" and numerous others both before and since have felt similarly.In MacDonald's fairy tales, both those for children and (like this one) those for adults, the ""fairy land"" clearly represents the spiritual world, or our own world revealed in all of its depth and meaning. At times almost forthrightly allegorical, at other times richly dreamlike (and indeed having a close connection to the symbolic world of dreams), this story of a young man who finds himself on a long journey through a land of fantasy is more truly the story of the spiritual quest that is at the core of his life's work, a quest that must end with the ultimate surrender of the self.The glory of MacDonald's work is that this surrender is both hard won (or lost!) and yet rippling with joy when at last experienced.

Pan-Africanism or Communism,,"['Africa', 'History']","George Padmore's Pan-Africanism or Communism shares the distinction common to most great works of historical writing of being the creation of a participant-as-historian. For, next to the colossal figure of W.E.B. Du Bois, Padmore, the political revolutionary, holds an exalted position in the pantheon of Pan-Africanism, and in this, his chef d'oeuvre, he has presented us with a most vivid account of that movement in which he played so exemplary a role. Indeed, there was in Padmore an admirable double-faceted vis historica - the revolutionary's desire to make history and the writer's impulse to describe it and grasp its meaning.The name George Padmore is a nom de guerre that he adopted when he joined the Communist Party. His real name was Malcolm Nurse. He rose to become the foremost black figure in the Communist International - the Comintern - and he was commissioned into the Red Army as a colonel. He travelled extensively in Africa in an effort to create the nucleus of a Comintern-directed African leadership. In this book he gives a graphic exposition of the history of African, West Indian and American Negro mass movements from 1787 to 1957, and their flirtations with International Communism. He helped to shape much of the latter phases of that affair. Soviet policy finally induced Padmore's resignation from the Comintern and also from the Communist Party. As Aimé Césaire stated when he too broke with the Communists twenty-five years later: 'It's neither Marxism nor Communism I repudiate; the use certain people have made of Marxism and Communism is what I condemn. What I want is that Marxism and Communism be harnessed into the service of coloured peoples, and not coloured people into the service of Marxism and Communism. That the doctrine and the movement be tailored to fit men, not men to fit the movement. And - of course - that goes for others besides Communists.'But in severing connections with them, Padmore did not join the frenzied ranks of the professional anti-Communists in remorseful contrition and fulminations over the god that failed them. Nor did he reconcile himself to imperialism and the oppressions of African peoples. There was in him a need to intensify the struggle against imperialism as also against that Communism which has been polluted by the exigencies of Stalin's balance-of-power political struggles with the Western countries. Arthur Koestler once wrote that 'if we survey history and compare the lofty aims in the name of which revolutions were started, and the sorry end to which they came, we see again and again how a polluted civilization pollutes its own revolutionary offspring'. Such an observation would lead - as, curiously, it did not lead Koestler - to the conclusion that if indeed the 'revolutionary offspring', Communism, has been 'polluted' by the civilization against which it has revolted, the struggle against this pollution becomes at once and simultaneously the struggle against the polluted offspring as also and inevitably against the source of that pollution. Padmore drew this conclusion. For though conceived by him as a bulwark against Communism, yet 'Pan-Africanism recognizes much that is true in the Marxist interpretation of history, since it provides a rational explanation for a good deal that would otherwise be unintelligible.'– Azinna NwaforThis book recounts the great saga of the rise of black people from slavery to freedom on an intercontinental scale and brings us to the crucial crossroads - a hopeful resolution for black freedom and a partnership of races purged of terror, lynching and colour lines, etc., or a continental mass struggle conducted by Africans in Africa, a struggle that will duplicate the tragic upheavals in Asia. It is not [solely] up to black men to say how this issue will be resolved; but make no mistake: the black man will cling tenaciously to his dream of freedom!If my words carry any weight, I commend this volume for close study to the white governmental officials of the Western world, to white churchmen, Catholic and Protestant alike, and equally to the dour and brooding white rulers in the Kremlin. I would urge them to read it and get a true, human perspective of the hopes, fears, struggles and hard-bought progress of the Negro in the modern world.I, for one, salute and congratulate George Padmore for his having kept the faith and fought the good fight.– Richard Wright",,,January 1st 1971,,[],,,9780385073226,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181025906l/1105253.jpg,4.21,[],32.0,1.0,,,,89.0,19.0,,,"['9', '7', '1', '2', '0']",,[],,['George Padmore']

In the early 1940s, Simenon began work on a memoir of his Belgian childhood. He showed the initial pages to André Gide, who urged him to turn them into a novel.

Spanning the years from the beginning of the century, with its political instability and terrorist threats, to the end of the First World War in 1918, Pedigree is an epic of everyday existence in all its messy unfinished intensity and density, a story about the coming-of-age of a precocious and curious boy and the coming to be of the modern world.",,,10/30/48,July 20th 2010,[],Paperback,,9781590173510,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320530490l/7969396.jpg,3.89,[],96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,169.0,560,NYRB Classics,"['48', '70', '37', '12', '2']",,[],,"['Georges Simenon', 'Robert Baldick', 'Luc Sante']"

Praise to the Man,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian Fiction', 'Spirituality']","Written with a dramatic intensity and an eye for historical detail that thousands of readers have come to appreciate in previous volumes, Praise to the Man — volume 6 in the series The Work and the Glory — follows the story of the restored Church and of the ficitonal Steed family from the summer of 1841 to the summer of 1844. Several momentous events take place during this period in Church history: Nauvoo becomes a well-established city; the Relief Society is founded; the endowment is administered for the first time in this dispensation; Joseph Smith becomes a candidate for president of the United States; he delivers his monumental King Follett Discourse. Meanwhile, however, dark forces outside as well as inside the Church are at work to destroy Joseph and the Restoration cause. Before the story ends, the powers of evil will have swept across the Church, taking out some in very high places, making numerous others waver, and taking Joseph and his brother Hyrum to their date with destiny in a town called Carthage. Woven throughout these events are the lives of the Steeds. As Joshua sees the Mormons gaining more influence with his wife and children, his patience finally reaches the breaking point. Will must resolve his feelings for Jenny Pottsworth and his desire to know if the Church is true. New hope is born in Jessica's life when she is offered a new teaching position. Mary Ann and other Steed women participate in the beginnings of the Relief Society. But before long, whisperings reach the ears of some of the Steeds about curious teachings and practices going on in Nauvoo — specifically it is rumored that God may have restored the ancient practice of plural marriage. How will they respond when they find out that at least some of the rumors are true? The issue becomes a trial of faith that shakes the Steed family to its very roots. At the center of this volume are the final days of the life and mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Though heart-wrenching in its depiction of the Prophet's last hours on earth, this book inspires admiration and affection for “the man who communed with Jehovah” and will fill readers with anticipation for that glorious time when, in the words of the hymn, “millions shall know 'Brother Joseph' again.”",The Work and the Glory #6,,10/29/95,October 10th 1998,[],Audio Cassette,,9781570085482,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1197090757l/625649.jpg,4.36,[],230.0,3.0,,,,98.0,8546.0,733,Bookcraft,"['4477', '2880', '1039', '128', '22']",,"['Nauvoo, Illinois (United States)']",,['Gerald N.

Pillar of Light,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Lds Fiction', 'Religion', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Adult', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction']","""You believe me, don't you, Nathan."" It was not a question, but a statement, filled with wonder.It stunned Nathan.""You believe it all. I can see it on your face.""For a moment, time seemed suspended as Nathan probed the inward recesses of his soul. There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was. He knew without the least shadow of doubt that everything Joseph was telling him was true. And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, ""Yes, Joseph, I believe you.""Pillar of Light — the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory — begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions — intensely personal, potentially divisive — will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.",The Work and the Glory #1,,10/01/94,November 1st 2004,[],Paperback,,9781590383636,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416338631l/625554.jpg,4.28,[],310.0,4.0,,,,97.0,15323.0,437,Deseret Book Company,"['7528', '5260', '2040', '361', '134']",,[],,['Gerald N.

People of the Book,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Books About Books', 'Mystery', 'Book Club', 'Jewish', 'Religion', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook']","From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of March, the journey of a rare illuminated manuscript through centuries of exile and warIn 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famed Sarajevo Haggadah, which has been rescued from Serb shelling during the Bosnian war. Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding—an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair—she begins to unlock the book’s mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book’s journey from its salvation back to its creation. In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city’s rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah’s extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna’s investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love. Inspired by a true story, People of the Book is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.",,,01/28/08,October 1st 2008,"['Hanna Heath', 'Ozren Karaman', 'Serif Kamal', 'Stela Kamal', 'Amitai Yomtov', 'Werner Heinrich', 'Razmus Kanaha', 'Dr. Franz Hirschfeldt', 'Florien Mittl', 'Giovanni Domenico Vistorini', 'Judah Aryeh', 'Sarah Heath', 'David Ben Shoushan', 'Ruth Ben Shoushan', 'Joseph Ben Shoushan', 'Reuben Ben Shoushan', 'Rosa del Salvador', 'Zahra bint Ibrahim al-Tarek', 'Aaron Sharansky']",Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442955497l/1379961._SY475_.jpg,4.02,"['National Jewish Book Award Nominee (2008)', 'Massachusetts Book Award for Fiction (2009)', ""Prime Minister's Literary Awards Nominee for Fiction (2009)"", 'Barbara Jefferis Award Nominee (2009)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for Literary Fiction and for Book of the Year (2008)', 'Mary Shelley Award for Outstanding Fictional Work (2009)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2010)']",3941.0,58.0,,,,94.0,123160.0,372,Viking Books,"['43804', '47731', '24218', '5688', '1719']",,"['Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina)', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina']",,['Geraldine Brooks']

Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories,,"['Graphic Novels', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comix', 'Comic Book', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Art', 'Novels']","For the first time ever, Fantagraphics is proud to present a single-volume collection of Gilbert Hernandez's ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories from Love & Rockets, which along with RAW magazine defined the modern literary comics movement of the post-underground generation. This massive volume collects every ""Heartbreak Soup"" story from 1993 to 2002 in one 500-page deluxe hardcover edition, presenting the epic for the first time as the single novel it was always intended to be. Palomar is the mythical Central American town where the ""Heartbreak Soup"" stories take place. The stories weave in and out of the town's entire population, crafting an intricate tapestry of Latin American experience. Hernandez's densely plotted and deeply imagined tales are often compared with magic realist authors like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende (House of the Spirits). His depictions of women and Mexican-American experience have been universally lauded as the best examples the artform has to offer. Luba, the guiding spirit of Palomar since the outset, has been hailed by The Nation, Rolling Stone, and Time magazine as one of the great characters of contemporary American fiction. Hernandez's work, in addition to the obvious magic realist comparisons, shares an affinity with other Latin American and Spanish writer/artists, like Frida Kahlo, Federico Garcia Lorca and Pablo Picasso, all of whom applied a surrealist eye to what they saw and experienced. Palomar follows the lives of its residents from Luba's arrival in the town to her exit, twenty years later. Included are such classic tales as ""Sopa de Gran Pena,"" ""Ecce Homo,"" ""An American in Palomar,"" ""Human Diastrophism,"" and ""Farewell, Mi Palomar."" Palomar presents one of the richest accomplishments in the history of the artform in its ideal format for the first time, making it a must-have for longtime Love & Rockets fans and new readers alike.",Love and Rockets,,July 2003,November 17th 2003,[],Hardcover,,9781560975397,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327877860l/61449.jpg,4.33,[],34.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2070.0,512,Fantagraphics,"['1166', '557', '235', '79', '33']",,[],,['Gilbert Hernández']

The city's vast wealth created centuries earlier by powerful Levantine dynasties, its factories teemed with Greeks, Armenians, Turks, and Jews. Together, they had created a majority Christian city that was unique in the Islamic world. But to the Turkish nationalists, Smyrna was a city of infidels.In the aftermath of the First World War and with the support of the Great Powers, Greece had invaded Turkey with the aim of restoring a Christian empire in Asia. But by the summer of 1922, the Greeks had been vanquished by Atatürk's armies after three years of warfare. As Greek troops retreated, the non-Muslim civilians of Smyrna assumed that American and European warships would intervene if and when the Turkish cavalry decided to enter the city. But this was not to be.On September 13, 1922, Turkish troops descended on Smyrna. They rampaged first through the Armenian quarter, and then throughout the rest of the city. They looted homes, raped women, and murdered untold thousands. Turkish soldiers were seen dousing buildings with petroleum. Soon, all but the Turkish quarter of the city was in flames and hundreds of thousands of refugees crowded the waterfront, desperate to escape. The city burned for four days; by the time the embers cooled, more than 100,000 people had been killed and millions left homeless.Based on eyewitness accounts and the memories of survivors, many interviewed for the first time, Paradise Lost offers a vivid narrative account of one of the most vicious military catastrophes of the modern age.",,,11/06/08,July 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9780465011193,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328841549l/3271565.jpg,4.2,[],92.0,1.0,,,,96.0,595.0,426,Basic Books,"['251', '237', '83', '22', '2']",,[],,['Giles Milton']
Profanations,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Essays', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Literature', 'Film', 'Art']","The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has always been an original reader of texts, understanding their many rich historical, aesthetic, and political meanings and effects. In Profanations, Agamben has assembled for the first time some of his most pivotal essays on photography, the novel, and film. A meditation on memory and oblivion, on what is lost and what remains, Profanations proves yet again that Agamben is one of the most provocative writers of our time. In ten essays, Agamben ponders a series of literary and philosophical problems: the relation among genius, ego, and theories of subjectivity; the problem of messianic time as explicated in both images and lived experience; parody as a literary paradigm; and the potential of magic to provide an ethical canon.The range of topics and themes addressed here attest to the creativity of Agamben's singular mode of thought and his persistent concern with the act of witnessing, sometimes futile, sometimes earth-shattering. -In Praise of Profanity, - the central essay of this short but dense book, confronts the question of profanity as the crucial political task of the moment. An act of resistance to every form of separation, the concept of profanation reorients perceptions of how power, consumption, and use interweave to produce an urgent political modality and desire: to profane the unprofanable.

Palimpsest,,"['Memoir', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'LGBT', 'American', 'Queer', 'Politics']","""I am not my own subject,"" Gore Vidal used to say. But now, surprisingly, he has turned his wit and elegant storytelling gifts to a candid memoir of the first forty years of his life. Palimpsest is written from the vantage point of Vidal's library in his villa on the Italian coast. As visitors come and go, his memory ranges back and forth across a rich history. Vidal's childhood was spent in Washington, D.C., in the household of his grandfather, the blind senator from Oklahoma, T. P. Gore, and in the various domestic situations of his complicated and exasperating mother, Nina. Then come schooldays at St. Albans and Exeter; the army; life as a literary wunderkind in New York, London, Rome, and Paris in the forties and fifties; sex in an age of promiscuity; and a campaign for Congress in 1960. Vidal's famous skills as a raconteur, his forthrightness, and his wicked wit are brilliantly at work in these recollections of a difficult family, talented friends, and interesting enemies. The cast includes Tennessee Williams, the Kennedys, Eleanor Roosevelt, Truman Capote, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, Christopher Isherwood, Jack Kerouac, Jane and Paul Bowles, Santayana, Anais Nin, Norman Mailer, Leonard Bernstein, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, among others. Beautifully rendered anecdotes are intermixed with meditations on writing, history, acting, and politics. Perhaps most surprising is the leitmotif of a great, lost love.

Papillon,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'France', 'History', 'Crime', 'Biography Memoir']","Henri Charrière, called ""Papillon,"" for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 of a murder he did not commit. Sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, he became obsessed with one goal: escape. After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.Charrière's astonishing autobiography, Papillon, was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape.

Plume: précédé de Lointain intérieur,,"['Poetry', 'France', 'French Literature', 'Fiction']","Dès ses premiers livres, Henri Michaux faisait entendre une voix profondément singulière. Et même si la parenté de ces textes avec les récits de Kafka (dans Plume notamment, publié en 1930) peut sembler évidente, leur force tient encore aujourd'hui du miracle : miracle de voir une langue retrouver sa jouvence, miracle de découvrir chaque mot remis à nu, débarrassé de tout artifice, y dévoilant un monde loin des apparences, une réalité secrète et souterraine. Toute sa vie, Michaux fut un grand solitaire, un aristocrate de la littérature. Mais à peine entrebâillées, les portes de ce Lointain intérieur projettent le lecteur dans un royaume de rêves et de terreurs, dont le fil se déroule suivant la logique implacable du désespoir. Ce monde brutal, pesant, écrase l'homme-plume avec une sauvagerie qui évoque les premiers âges de notre Histoire. La poésie de Michaux ne s'embarrasse pas de mélodies. Cri, clameur, puis rumeur, gonflements et sursauts, éruptions puis éboulements. Moderne, à l'écart de toutes les modes, Michaux a su demeurer une référence, un pionnier qui n'a pas pris une ride. --Scarbo",,,10/29/30,October 1st 1985,[],Paperback,,9782070323173,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369153048l/2185736.jpg,3.85,['PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for Richard Sieburth (2019)'],188.0,2.0,,,,89.0,232.0,220,Gallimard,"['77', '76', '53', '19', '7']",,[],,['Henri Michaux']
Plays 2: A Doll's House / An Enemy of the People / Hedda Gabler,,"['Drama', 'Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Feminism']","
  This volume contains Ibsen's two most famous and frequently read, studied and performed plays about women: A Doll's House (1879), his first international success, which 'exploded like a bomb into contemporary life', and Hedda Gabler (1890), now one of his most popular plays, but greeted at first with bewilderment and outrage ('The play is simply a bad escape of moral sewage-gas' Pictorial World). Also included is An Enemy of the People (1883), whose central character was the actor Konstantin Stanislavski's favourite role.

Peer Gynt,,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Poetry', 'Scandinavian Literature', '19th Century', 'Fantasy', 'Literature']","Among the masterpieces of world literature, this early verse drama by the celebrated Norwegian playwright humorously yet profoundly explores the virtues, vices, and follies common to all humanity — as represented in the person of Peer Gynt, a charming but irresponsible young peasant. Based on Norwegian folklore and Ibsen’s own imaginative inventions, the play relates the roguish life of the world-wandering Peer, who finds wealth and fame — but never happiness — although he is redeemed by love in the end. As the play opens the young farmer attends a wedding and meets Solveig, the woman who is eventually to be his salvation. However, the rascally Peer then kidnaps the bride and later abandons her in the wilderness. This dismal performance is followed by a string of adventures (many of which do not reflect well on Peer) in many lands. After these soul-chilling exploits, an old and embittered Peer returns to Norway, eventually finding solace in the arms of the faithful Solveig. Like other early Ibsen plays, such as Brand (1865) and Emperor and Galilean (1873), the work is imbued with poetic mysticism and romanticism, and in Peer we find a rebellious central character in search of an ultimate truth that always seems just out of reach. In this sense Peer can be seen as an alter ego of Ibsen himself, whose lifelong search for artistic and moral certainties resulted in the great later plays (Hedda Gabler, The Wild Duck, An Enemy of the People, etc.) upon which his reputation chiefly rests. This rich, poetic version of Peer Gynt is considered the standard translation.",,,11/14/67,May 7th 2003,[],Paperback,,9780486426860,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389996366l/279221.jpg,3.73,[],78.0,1.0,,,,89.0,5379.0,144,Dover Publications,"['1431', '1771', '1565', '494', '118']",,[],,"['Henrik Ibsen', 'William Archer', 'Charles Archer']"

  The planning, the strategy, the sacrifices and heroics-on both sides-illuminating the greatest naval war in history.
On the first Sunday in December 1941, an armada of Japanese warplanes appeared suddenly over Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and devastated the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Six months later, in a sea fight north of the tiny atoll of Midway, four Japanese aircraft carriers were sent into the abyss. Pacific Crucible tells the epic tale of these first searing months of the Pacific war, when the U.S. Navy shook off the worst defeat in American military history and seized the strategic initiative.Ian W. Toll's dramatic narrative encompasses both the high command and the ""sailor's-eye"" view from the lower deck. Relying predominantly on eyewitness accounts and primary sources, Pacific Crucible also spotlights recent scholarship that has revised our understanding of the conflict, including the Japanese decision to provoke a war that few in the country's highest circles thought they could win. The result is a page-turning history that does justice to the breadth and depth of a tremendous subject.",The Pacific War Trilogy #1,,,November 14th 2011,"['Douglas MacArthur', 'Hirohito', 'George C.

Pakistan: A Personal History,,"['Pakistan', 'Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Memoir', 'Sports', 'Autobiography']","Born only five years after Pakistan was created in 1947, Imran Khan has lived his country's history. Undermined by a ruling elite hungry for money and power, Pakistan now stands alone as the only Islamic country with a nuclear bomb, yet it is unable to protect its people from the carnage of regular bombings from terrorists and its own ally, America. Now with the revelation that Pakistan has been the hiding place of Osama bin Laden for several years, that relationship can only grow more strained. How did it reach this flashpoint of instability and injustice with such potentially catastrophic results for Pakistan?Recounting his country's history through the prism of his own memories, Imran Khan starts from its foundation, ripped out of the dying British Raj. He guides us through and comments on subsequent historical developments which shook the Muslim world - the wars with India in 1965 and 1971, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and America's retribution 10 years later with the assassination of bin Laden - to the current controversial and intractable war in Afghanistan.We see these events viewed not only through the eyes of Westerners, but through those of ordinary Pakistanis.Drawing on the experiences of his own family and his wide travels within his homeland, Pakistan: A Personal History provides a unique insider's view of a country unfamiliar to a western audience. Woven into this history we see how Imran Khan's personal life - his happy childhood in Lahore, his Oxford education, his extraordinary cricketing career, his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, his mother's influence and that of his Islamic faith - inform both the historical narrative and his current philanthropic and political activities. It is at once absorbing and insightful, casting fresh light upon a country whose culture he believes is largely misunderstood by the West.",,,,September 15th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780593067741,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320519179l/12683634.jpg,4.09,[],98.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1575.0,400,Bantam Press,"['706', '454', '303', '71', '41']",,[],,['Imran Khan']

Prokleta avlija,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'School', 'Serbian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Read For School']","Prokleta avlija/The Damned Yard (Description from Ivo Andrić Foundation website)The novel is written in 1954. Ćamil, a wealthy young man of Smyrna living in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, is fascinated by the story of Džem, ill-fated brother of the Sultan Bajazet, who ruled Turkey in the fifteenth century. Ćamil, in his isolation, comes to believe that he is Džem, and that he shares his evil destiny: he is born to be a victim of the State. Because of his stories about Džem’s ambitions to overthrow his brother, Ćamil is arrested under suspicion of plotting against the Sultan. He is taken to a prison in Istanbul, where he tells his story, to Petar, a monk.Out of these exotic materials, Andrić has constructed a book of great clarity, brevity and interest. No doubt it will be read by some as a political parable about the tyranny of the State, but also as a quite simply story about ill-fortune and human misunderstanding, fear and ignorance. Džem and Ćamil are doomed – and the certainty of their persecution is sometimes relieved, sometimes intensified by the stupidity and fright of the people who cross their ill-starred lives.Construction takes up most of the book’s space: the central story of Džem as related by Ćamil lasts only a chapter or two. For the rest of the time the reader strips layer off layer, as one narrator passes him on the next. There is an interesting passage that helps to explain this method, at the moment when Ćamil starts narrating Džem’s story in the first person. “I” is a word, we are told, which fixes the position of the speaker in such a way that the exercise of will is no longer possible, and the speaker strength is exceeded – strength, presumably, to break out of the identification that all his past actions and thoughts force upon him when he uses the word. “I” is both a confession and an imprisonment. The fact that the novel passes the reader on from one narrator to the next rather suggests that the author is taking constant evasive action, lest he betray himself or his reader into the kind of “personal confession” which seals the fate of Ćamil. What exactly this game of form flirting with meaning signifies, must be left to the individual reader.The movement is centripetal, towards Džem’s story, and then disperses. Details within the story are made to mimic this form. Thus when Peter receives the message telling him of his impending release:“Two younger prisoners...were chasing around using him as the centerpoint of ever narrowing circles. Annoyed, he tried to break away from these exuberant youths when one of them brushed against him and he felt a folded scrap of paper thrust into his hand. The youths continued their chase but now in widening circles...”The reader is led on just such a chase in the course of the novel. The effect of this is to make the plot seem more like a poetic image than an ordinary plot: capable, therefore, of as many meanings as are the images of an allusive poem. Yet the language is simple and direct, not at all “poetic”. The characters are remarkable alive, even in conversation. Karađoz, the governor of the goal, is a spidery authoritarian, who loves to torment the charges he loves. The prisoners “complained about the way one complains about one’s life and curses one’s destiny...it would have been hard for them to imagine life without him”.“The Devil’s Yard” is justified, as all symbolic and figurative novels must be, by the extent to which it touches the emotions. It is extremely moving. Fear, horror, despair, amusement at times – all these indicate that the threat of the meaning has been recognized.",,,10/28/54,,[],Hardcover,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452219308l/11553583.jpg,4.3,[],528.0,6.0,,,,96.0,7123.0,120,,"['3646', '2265', '962', '209', '41']",,[],,['Ivo Andrić']

"Purpose and Desire: What Makes Something ""Alive"" and Why Modern Darwinism Has Failed to Explain It",,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Philosophy']","A professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism’s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is—and only an openness to the qualities of ""purpose and desire"" will move the field forward.Scott Turner contends. ""To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson’s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life’s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life.""Growing research shows that life's most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In Purpose and Desire, Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard’s ""dangerous idea"" of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes ""life"" a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature.A thoughtful appeal to widen our perspective of biology that is grounded in scientific evidence, Purpose and Desire helps us bridge the ideological evolutionary divide.",,,2017,September 12th 2017,[],ebook,,9780062651587,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492898536l/33544897.jpg,3.61,[],20.0,1.0,,,,85.0,59.0,352,HarperOne,"['15', '18', '17', '6', '3']",,[],,['J.

Hook, Smee, the lost boys, pirates and the indians, and, of course, Tinker Bell, in their adventures in Never Land. However, for the first time, the play is here restored to Barrie's original intentions. In the words of John Caird: ""A brief explanation of some of the decisions we took in revising the text may be useful to anyone considering their own production of this version We were fascinated to discover that there was no one single document called PETER PAN. What we found was a tantalizing number of different versions, all of them containing some very agreeable surprises We have made some significant alterations, the greatest of which is the introduction of a new character, the Storyteller, who is in fact the author himself. To a reader of the play, one of its most enjoyable ingredients is Barrie's unmistakable authorial tone. He tells the story of Peter Pan partly through dialogue and partly by means of his inimitable stage directions.

Want dat wil hij worden, een groot dichter met een wild liefdesleven, hij wil gedichten schrijven waarvan de schoonheid met stomheid slaat, gedichten die iets uitdrukken wat hij in de Zuid-Afrikaanse bewegingsloosheid maar niet kan uitdrukken - maar wat eigenlijk? Hij moet weg, naar Londen, daar wordt verfijnder gesproken, daar zal hij zijn weg vinden naar de vrouwen en de grote poëzie. Natuurlijk is zijn moeder ontsteld, wat moet dat dan wel voorstellen, een dichter, en bovendien schijnt het in Londen koud te zijn. Het Londen van de vroege jaren zestig, waar hij toch naartoe gaat, is nog geen 'swinging London', maar een verwarrende en vijandige mierenhoop. Hij schopt het daar ten slotte tot programmeur.

Pride and Prejudice,,Fiction,"'his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!' Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and menide down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight.

  From the bestselling, Edgar Award–winning author of the “terrifically good” (The New York Times) Red Sparrow, a compulsively readable new novel about star-crossed Russian agent Dominika Egorova and CIA's Nate Nash in a desperate race to the finish.
Captain Dominika Egorova of the Russian Intelligence Service (SVR) has returned from the West to Moscow. She despises the men she serves, the oligarchs, and crooks, and thugs of Putin’s Russia. What no one knows is that Dominika is working for the CIA as Washington’s most sensitive penetration of SVR and the Kremlin.As she expertly dodges exposure, Dominika deals with a murderously psychotic boss; survives an Iranian assassination attempt; escapes a counterintelligence ambush; rescues an arrested agent and exfiltrates him out of Russia; and has a chilling midnight conversation in her nightgown with President Putin. Complicating these risks is the fact that Dominika is in love with her CIA handler, Nate Nash, and their lust is as dangerous as committing espionage in Moscow. And when a mole in the SVR finds Dominika’s name on a restricted list of sources, it is a virtual death sentence…Just as fast-paced, heart-pounding, and action-packed as Red Sparrow, Jason Matthews’s second novel confirms he is “an insider’s insider…and a masterful storyteller” (Vince Flynn, #1 New York Times bestselling author).",Red Sparrow Trilogy #2,,,June 2nd 2015,[],Hardcover,,9781476793740,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430083996l/22609257.jpg,4.2,[],93.0,1.0,,,,97.0,18670.0,480,Scribner,"['7782', '7685', '2555', '502', '146']",,[],,['Jason Matthews']

Always an outcast himself, Genet was drawn to this displaced people, an attraction that was to prove as complicated for him as it was enduring.

For Genet's most overtly political book is also his most personal—the last step in the unrepentantly sacrilegious pilgrimage first recorded in The Thief's Journal, and a searching meditation, packed with visions, ruses, and contradictions, on such life-and-death issues as the politics of the image and the seductive and treacherous character of identity.

In one of those states, even birthing centers are outlawed.When did birth become an emergency instead of an emergence? Since when is normal, physiological birth a crime?

Crisscrossing the country to report what women really experience during childbirth, Jennifer Block witnessed several births - from a planned cesarean to an underground home birth.

She examines childbirth as a reproductive rights issue: Do women have the right to an optimal birth experience? If so, is that right being upheld? Block's research and experience reveal in vivid detail that while emergency obstetric care is essential, there is compelling evidence that we are overusing medical technology at the expense of maternal and infant health: Either women's bodies are failing, or the system is failing women.",,,06/01/07,June 4th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780738210735,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438294064l/607901._SY475_.jpg,4.23,[],77.0,1.0,,,,95.0,2652.0,316,Da Capo Press,"['1262', '915', '349', '77', '49']",,[],,['Jennifer Block']

Plebs,,"['Horror', 'Splatterpunk']","Corey Somerset, Tim Hayworth and Lee Hunter have had one hell of a good night. And it isn't over yet. Celebrating their friend's birthday with drunken debauchery and intoxicated antics they've just stumbled through a mini-wave of mindless vandalism and though they've wandered far out of the realms of civilization they are keen to keep the party vibe going. When they encounter a band of mysterious fugitive women who call a bizarre encampment deep in the woods their residence it appears a strong likelihood that continuing the party is on the cards. But it won't come without a price. The collective of unnerving lawless women are open to the suggestion but not without the threesome completing a request first, a seemingly straight forward barter proposition that will bring the boys face to face with something else that dwells in an unorthodox co-existence with the girls in the wilderness. These are the Plebs and the shocking violent encounter the trio are unwittingly pitched into with these freakish feral fiends may be their first but it won't be the last. As the shiftless young men become inextricably entwined and involved with the agenda driven dangerous women so too do their fates, with them unravelling killer secrets, duplicity, bloodshed and brutality along the way that encompasses not just them but more of their friends, new enemies and old enemies. A simple night of bad decisions escalates and snowballs into an expedition of terror spanning all the way home and beyond with Corey and his friends engulfed in a nightmare where the lines between man and monster blur.

But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live plain. As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires.",,,05/01/00,November 1st 2004,[],Hardcover,,9780743275019,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389750843l/14864.jpg,3.98,['Mary Higgins Clark Award Nominee (2001)'],1674.0,23.0,,,,95.0,163677.0,405,Atria Books,"['51316', '67104', '36989', '6563', '1705']",,"['Paradise, Pennsylvania (United States)']",,['Jodi Picoult']

Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Sports', 'Africa', 'Biography', 'South Africa', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race', 'Leadership']","A thrilling, inspiring account of one of the greatest charm offensives in history--Nelson Mandela's decade-long campaign to unite his country, beginning in his jail cell and ending with a rugby tournament.In 1985, Nelson Mandela, then in prison for twenty-three years, set about winning over the fiercest proponents of apartheid, from his jailers to the head of South Africa's military. First he earned his freedom and then he won the presidency in the nation's first free election in 1994. But he knew that South Africa was still dangerously divided by almost fifty years of apartheid. If he couldn't unite his country in a visceral, emotional way--and fast--it would collapse into chaos. He would need all the charisma and strategic acumen he had honed during half a century of activism, and he'd need a cause all South Africans could share. Mandela picked one of the more farfetched causes imaginable--the national rugby team, the Springboks, who would host the sport's World Cup in 1995.Against the giants of the sport, the Springboks' chances of victory were remote. But their chances of capturing the hearts of most South Africans seemed remoter still, as they had long been the embodiment of white supremacist rule. During apartheid, the all-white Springboks and their fans had belted out racist fight songs, and blacks would come to Springbok matches to cheer for whatever team was playing against them. Yet Mandela believed that the Springboks could embody--and engage--the new South Africa. And the Springboks themselves embraced the scheme. Soon South African TV would carry images of the team singing ""Nkosi Sikelele Afrika,"" the longtime anthem of black resistance to apartheid.As their surprising string of victories lengthened, their home-field advantage grew exponentially. South Africans of every color and political stripe found themselves falling for the team. When the Springboks took to the field for the championship match against New Zealand's heavily favored squad, Mandela sat in his presidential box wearing a Springbok jersey while sixty-two-thousand fans, mostly white, chanted ""Nelson! Nelson!"" Millions more gathered around their TV sets, whether in dusty black townships or leafy white suburbs, to urge their team toward victory. The Springboks won a nail-biter that day, defying the oddsmakers and capping Mandela's miraculous ten-year-long effort to bring forty-three million South Africans together in an enduring bond.John Carlin, a former South Africa bureau chief for the London Independent, offers a singular portrait of the greatest statesman of our time in action, blending the volatile cocktail of race, sport, and politics to intoxicating effect. He draws on extensive interviews with Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and dozens of other South Africans caught up in Mandela's momentous campaign, and the Springboks' unlikely triumph. As he makes stirringly clear, their championship transcended the mere thrill of victory to erase ancient hatreds and make a nation whole.",,,,August 14th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9781594201745,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347609913l/2964456.jpg,4.15,[],186.0,4.0,,,,96.0,4210.0,274,Penguin Press,"['1685', '1695', '660', '137', '33']",,[],,['John Carlin']

Porius,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Arthurian', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'British Literature', 'Mythology']","""Porius stood upon the low square tower above the Southern Gate of Mynydd-y-Gaer, and looked down on the wide stretching valley below."" So begins one of the most unique novels of twentieth-century literature, by one of its most ""extraordinary, neglected geniuses,"" said Robertson Davies of John Cowper Powys. Powys thought Porius his masterpiece, but because of the paper shortage after World War II and the novel's lengthiness, he could not find a publisher for it. Only after he cut one-third from it was it accepted. This new edition not only brings Porius back into print, but makes the original book at last available to readers. Set in the geographic confines of Powys's own homeland of Northern Wales, Porius takes place in the course of a mere eight October days in 499 A.D., when King Arthur - a key character in the novel, along with Myrddin Wyllt, or Merlin - was attempting to persuade the people of Britian to repel the barbaric Saxon invaders. Porius, the only child of Prince Einion of Edeyrnion, is the main character who is sent on a journey that is both historical melodrama and satirical allegory. A complex novel, Porius is a mixture of mystery and philosophy on a huge narrative scale, as if Nabokov or Pynchon tried to compress Dostoevsky into a Ulyssean mold. Writing in The New Yorker, George Steiner has said of the abridged Porius that it ""combines [a] Shakespearean-epic sweep of historicity with a Jamesian finesse of psychological detail and acuity. Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!, which I believe to be the American masterpiece after Melville, is a smaller thing by comparison."" This new, and first complete, edition of the novel substantiates both Steiner's judgement and Powys's claim for Porius as his masterpiece.",,,11/06/51,August 16th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9781585673667,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348037154l/959614.jpg,4.31,[],91.0,1.0,,,,93.0,124.0,751,Overlook,"['71', '32', '12', '6', '3']",,[],,"['John Cowper Powys', 'Judith Bond', 'Morine Krissdottir']"
Papa Married A Mormon,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Religion', 'Classics', 'Humor', 'Historical', 'Lds', 'Young Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'Childrens']","Papa Married a Mormon made its initial appearance in McCall's magazine in 1955 and later became a bestseller for Prentice-Hall and a selection of two book clubs. Mamma's Boarding House and Uncle Will and the Fitzgerald Curse followed soon after, but good luck finding either of them.Born in Price, Utah, in 1907 to a Scandinavian Mormon mother and an Irish Catholic father, he grew up influenced by both cultures. He left Utah behind at age eighteen, working at such varied jobs as playing in a jazz band, working in a bank, and serving as an overseas newspaper correspondent. At the time of his first break into the national literary scene, he was a purchaser for a steel company in California. Fitzgerald began writing Papa Married a Mormon, a family history about his boyhood, to fulfill a promise made to his mother on her death-bed. She implored him to tell the story of those who settled the west. Not so much a story of the Mormons, but of the people themselves – specifically Fitzgerald’s family and members of the Mormon/Gentile community in which they lived.Set in the fictional southern Utah community of Adenville, Fitzgerald creates a nostalgic picture of small town life in early 1900s. The story tells of the conflicts between the Mormons and gentiles within the community, and how leaders on both sides managed to unify the town, despite their differences and animosities. Because many parts of the book are similar in prose to Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn novels, Papa Married a Mormon fits the mold of a Victorian look at an era long gone.Reference: The Promise Is Fulfilled: Literary Aspects of John D.

Kennedy, with an introduction by Caroline Kennedy and a foreword by Robert F. Kennedy.Written in 1955 by the then junior senator from the state of Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage serves as a clarion call to every American.In this book Kennedy chose eight of his historical colleagues to profile for their acts of astounding integrity in the face of overwhelming opposition. These heroes, coming from different junctures in our nation’s history, include John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, and Robert A. Taft.Now, a half-century later, the book remains a moving, powerful, and relevant testament to the indomitable national spirit and an unparalleled celebration of that most noble of human virtues. It resounds with timeless lessons on the most cherished of virtues and is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. Profiles in Courage is as Robert Kennedy states in the foreword: “not just stories of the past but a book of hope and confidence for the future. What happens to the country, to the world, depends on what we do with what others have left us.""Along with vintage photographs and an extensive author biography, this book features Kennedy's correspondence about the writing project, contemporary reviews, a letter from Ernest Hemingway, and two rousing speeches from recipients of the Profile in Courage Award.  Introduction by John F.

Planetwalker: 22 Years of Walking. 17 Years of Silence.,,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Environment', 'Biography', 'Philosophy', 'Walking', 'Autobiography', 'Adventure', 'Biography Memoir']","When the struggle to save oil-soaked birds and restore blackened beaches left him feeling frustrated and helpless, John Francis decided to take a more fundamental and personal stand-he stopped using all forms of motorized transportation. Soon after embarking on this quest that would span two decades and two continents, the young man took a vow of silence that endured for 17 years. It began as a silent environmental protest, but as a young African-American man, walking across the country in the early 1970s, his idea of ""the environment"" expanded beyond concern about pollution and loss of habitat to include how we humans treat each other and how we can better communicate and work together to benefit the earth. Through his silence and walking, he learned to listen, and along the way, earned college and graduate degrees in science and environmental studies. The United Nations appointed him goodwill ambassador to the world's grassroots communities and the U.S. government recruited him to help address the Exxon Valdez disaster. Was he crazy? How did he live and earn all those degrees without talking? An amazing human-interest story, with a vital message, Planetwalker is also a deeply personal and engaging coming-of-age odyssey-the positive experiences, the challenging times, the characters encountered, and the learning gained along the way.",,,03/01/05,April 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,,9781426202759,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320442404l/1777804.jpg,3.82,[],71.0,1.0,,,,90.0,793.0,288,National Geographic,"['222', '298', '195', '61', '17']",,['United States of America'],,['John Francis']

Against enormous odds Arnie finally locates just such a team and informs Rick that, miraculously, he can in fact now be a starting quarterback–for the mighty Panthers of Parma, Italy.Yes, Italians do play American football, to one degree or another, and the Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player–any former NFL player–at their helm.

Psychonavigation,Techniques for Travel Beyond Time,"Body, Mind & Spirit","After 'Hit Man' The New York Times bestseller Confessions of an Economic Hit Man documents John Perkins’ extraordinary career as a globe-trotting economic hit man. Perkins’ insider’s view leads him to crisis of conscience--to the realization that he must devote himself to work which will foster a world-wide awareness of the sanctity of indigenous peoples, their cultures, and their environments. Perkins’ books demonstrate how the age-old shamanic techniques of some of the world’s most primitive peoples have sparked a revolution in modern concepts about healing, the subconscious, and the powers each of us has to alter individual and communal reality. This groundbreaking book is John Perkins’s firsthand account of his experiences with the shamanic technique of psychonavigation--a method of traveling outside the body by means of visions and dream wanderings--and his encounters with the Shuar of the Amazon, the Quechua of the Andes, and the Bugis of Indonesia. Shuar shamans psychonavigate for the purposes of hunting and healing, while the Bugis, among the most renowned sailors of the world, use these techniques to navigate without the aid of charts and compasses. Perkins explains how these techniques work and how the people of these indigenous cultures psychonavigate to both distant physical destinations and sources of inner wisdom. Throughout history, psychonavigation has been practiced by highly creative minds such as Beethoven, Jung, and Einstein. Perkins’s riveting narrative takes us on a journey of personal discovery as he learns the great value of these techniques and their relevance not only to individual well-being, but to the health of the environment and of the world at large. He reveals how by attuning to the positive forces in nature and communicating with our inner guides we all can become psychonavigators, finding our way to wise decisions and developing innovative approaches to the challenges we face as individuals and a world community.",,,,1999.0,,,089281800X,9780892818006,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1I1SvwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.19,,,,,,,,,144.0,,,59.0,,,['John Perkins']

First published in Latin in 1720 and in eighteenth century English in 1751, this work is both fascinating and seminal.

Dr Cooper explores the life of Toland, his influences and contributions to Philosophy, including Natural, Social, Political and Religious, and his ongoing relevance in the twenty-first century and beyond. Also included is a glossary detailing Toland's 'Universe of Terms' emerging from Pantheisticon and his earlier Letters to Serena (1704) that showcase his myriad contributions to Pantheism, Cosmology and the Philosophy of the Universe.

"Pink Flamingos, and Other Filth",Three Screenplays,Performing Arts,"Here are three of the filthiest-and yet, in their own way, sweetest—screenplays ever written: Pink Flamingos, Desperate Living, and Flamingos Forever. Intermixed with the scripts are dozens of classic stills from the films. In Pink Flamingos, Waters's muse and leading lady, Divine, a 300-pound cross-dresser who could turn your stomach in one scene and break your heart in the next, competes with her family for the title of ""filthiest people alive""—as readers will see, it's really anyone's game. Desperate Living is a perverse fairy tale featuring gun-toting lesbians, leather-clad castle guards, and a repulsive queen who has her own daughter gang-raped among other atrocities. Flamingos Forever is the unproduced sequel to Pink Flamingos, set fifteen years after the original, when the rivalry for ""filthiest people alive"" is revived; it was never filmed, Waters tells us, because by the time it was written, too many of the original cast had died—this book is the only chance for Water's fans to read it.",,,,2005.0,,,1560257016,9781560257011,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nNlBZApxhx8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.22,,,,,,,,,258.0,,,49.0,,,['John Waters']

She knows that her real name is Purity, that she's saddled with $130,000 in student debt, that she's squatting with anarchists in Oakland, and that her relationship with her mother - her only family - is hazardous. But she doesn't have a clue who her father is, why her mother chose to live as a recluse with an invented name, or how she'll ever have a normal life. Enter the Germans. A glancing encounter with a German peace activist leads Pip to an internship in South America with The Sunlight Project, an organization that traffics in all the secrets of the world--including, Pip hopes, the secret of her origins. TSP is the brainchild of Andreas Wolf, a charismatic provocateur who rose to fame in the chaos following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now on the lam in Bolivia, Andreas is drawn to Pip for reasons she doesn't understand, and the intensity of her response to him upends her conventional ideas of right and wrong. Purity is a grand story of youthful idealism, extreme fidelity, and murder. The author of The Corrections and Freedom has imagined a world of vividly original characters - Californians and East Germans, good parents and bad parents, journalists and leakers - and he follows their intertwining paths through landscapes as contemporary as the omnipresent Internet and as ancient as the war between the sexes.

Pathways to Bliss: Mythology and Personal Transformation,,"['Mythology', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Self Help', 'History', 'Personal Development', 'Essays']","Joseph Campbell famously defined myth as “other people's religion.” But he also said that one of the basic functions of myth is to help each individual through the journey of life, providing a sort of travel guide or map to reach fulfillment — or, as he called it, bliss. For Campbell, many of the world's most powerful myths support the individual's heroic path toward bliss.In Pathways to Bliss, Campbell examines this personal, psychological side of myth. Like his classic best-selling books Myths to Live By and The Power of Myth, Pathways to Bliss draws from Campbell's popular lectures and dialogues, which highlight his remarkable storytelling and ability to apply the larger themes of world mythology to personal growth and the quest for transformation. Here he anchors mythology's symbolic wisdom to the individual, applying the most poetic mythical metaphors to the challenges of our daily lives.Campbell dwells on life's important questions.

Es muy celebre el primer parrafo: “Platero es pequeño, peludo, suave; tan blando por fuera, que se diría todo de algodón, que no lleva huesos. Sólo los espejos de azabache de sus ojos son duros cual dos escarabajos de cristal negro. Lo dejo suelto y se va al prado y acaricia tibiamente, rozándolas apenas, las florecillas rosas, celestes y gualdas... Lo llamo dulcemente: ¿Platero?, y viene a mi con un trotecillo alegre, que parece que se ríe, en no sé que cascabeleo ideal...”La primera edición se publico en 1914 (Ediciones De La Lectura) y en 1917 se publicó la edición completa, compuesta por 138 capítulos (Editorial Calleja, Madrid). Quedaba claro que era un texto adulto, aunque por su sencillez y transparencia se adecuara perfectamente a la imaginación y al gusto de los niños. Algunos capítulos encerraban una cierta critica social, revelando una dimensión del autor que muchos tardaron en advertir. El propio Juan Ramón Jiménez, en un prologuillo a la edición aclaraba: “Yo nunca he escrito ni escribiré nada para niños porque creo que el niño puede leer los libros que lee el hombre, con determinadas excepciones que a todos se le ocurren.”El poeta tenía la intención de ampliar el texto hasta los 190 capítulos; de hecho, existen tres adicionales, escritos en la década de 1920. Juan Ramón Jiménez planeó también una segunda parte, denominada Otra vida de Platero, de la que incluso esbozó algunos títulos.

Philosophy in a Time of Terror,Dialogues with Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida,History,"""In her introduction, Borradori contends that philosophy has an invaluable contribution to make to the understanding of terrorism. Just as the traumas produced by colonialism, totalitarianism, and the Holocaust wrote the history of the twentieth century, the history of the twenty-first century is already signed by global terrorism. Each dialogue here, accompanied by a critical essay, recognizes the magnitude of this upcoming challenge. Characteristically, Habermas's dialogue is dense, compact, and elegantly traditional. Derrida's, on the other hand, takes the reader on a long, winding, and unpredictable road. Yet unexpected agreements emerge between them: both have a deep suspicion of the concept of ""terrorism"" and both see the need for a transition from classical international law, premised on the model of nation-states, to a new cosmopolitan order based on continental alliances."".",,,,2004.0,,,0226066665,9780226066660,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ze0Pn60iZvEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.89,,,,,,,,,208.0,,,428.0,,,"['Jürgen Habermas', 'Giovanna Borradori', 'Jacques Derrida']"

In preparing these lectures Jaspers, whom the Nazis had already dismissed from his professorship at Heidelberg, knew that he was speaking in Germany for the last time. Jaspers used the occasion to offer an account of the cultural and intellectual situation from which existentialism emerged as well as a summary of his own philosophy.The book serves three purposes today: it brings the many strands of the existential movement into focus; it provides an overview of Jaspers's own philosophical position; and it demonstrates by example that philosophy need not be irrational, antiscientific, journalistic, or homiletic in order to be existential and engage. In this short book Jaspers provides a corrective for the popular view of existentialism as a pessimistic, irrationalist philosophy. He maintains that it is, rather part of mainstream of Western philosophy--the form that philosophy has taken in our day.",,,11/06/38,January 1st 1971,[],Paperback,,9780812210101,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347245733l/368124.jpg,3.8,[],93.0,1.0,,,,90.0,214.0,128,University of Pennsylvania Press,"['61', '75', '56', '19', '3']",,[],,"['Karl Jaspers', 'Richard F.

Though only thirteen years old, he has lived alone in the Darkwood since his mentor, an elderly monk, died nearly four years ago. His life is one of isolation and self-loathing until he is unwittingly-then unwillingly-drawn into a multi-faceted plot that includes an assassination attempt on the royal prince and the beginnings of a civil war. Pajo must race to the royal city to save the Infant Prince while outrunning the crazed killer determined to stop him. Through interactions with some new companions, Pajo learns a great deal about himself and his duty to do what is right and honorable, even when it is neither convenient nor easy. Pajo also discovers that the name that was given to him may mean more than he could have possibly imagined-and may well link him to a national patriarch who lives only within the pages of a two-thousand-year-old book.A mighty tale of fantasy, magic, and adventure, ""Pajo"" explores the virtues of character and hope and celebrates the true meaning of heroism.",,,,October 26th 2007,[],Paperback,,9780595460618,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347377592l/2134448.jpg,4.83,[],98.0,1.0,,,,100.0,6.0,472,iUniverse,"['5', '1', '0', '0', '0']",,[],,['Karl L.

Pengembaraan Dr. Karl May: Llano Estacado,,"['Adventure', 'Westerns', 'Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Young Adult', 'Indonesian Literature', 'Childrens', '19th Century']","The Spanish name Llano Estacado, meaning Staked Plain, is part of the high plains of the United States, located west of today’s Lubbock, Texas. It covers an area of about 30,000 square miles, extending to the state of New Mexico. It is a strikingly flat and monotonous area at an elevation of between 3,000-4,000 feet. Local water-retaining depressions and washes that, due to the meager rainfall, rarely hold water occasionally break this semiarid plain. Sandstorms can cut down vision in the midst of day and scour the unwary with tiny bullets of sand. It is said that even Indians hesitated to cross this wasteland. Myth holds that the Coronado expedition planted stakes as guideposts for the return trip when it first crossed the plain westward, giving the area its name. Karl May has used the myth of the stakes as a backdrop for his story of ‘The Ghost of Llano Estacado’. Again, he assembles many of his Western heroes for new adventures and the performance of good deeds, in the process adding a few new characters. One of his recurring characters, Hobble-Frank, owner of the Villa “Bear Fat” in Saxony, know-it-all, mangler of half-knowledge, with his persistent and extensive elaboration’s, may have been funny a hundred years ago when read in German. However, his argumentative discourses, when translated into English, become rather tedious. They often have no meaning for the English-only reader, since they deal with local events and characters of his (and Karl May’s) home state, and mangle geography and ancient history in an attempt to be funny. At worst, they make no sense when translated. Hence, I have taken the liberty to severely edit his profuseness to make the story line flow more smoothly.

"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Russia', 'American History', 'Grad School', 'Reportage', 'Politics', 'Russian History', 'United States']","While many transnational histories of the nuclear arms race have been written, Kate Brown provides the first definitive account of the great plutonium disasters of the United States and the Soviet Union.In Plutopia,  Brown draws on official records and dozens of interviews to tell the extraordinary stories of Richland, Washington and Ozersk, Russia-the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium. To contain secrets, American and Soviet leaders created plutopias--communities of nuclear families living in highly-subsidized, limited-access atomic cities. Fully employed and medically monitored, the residents of Richland and Ozersk enjoyed all the pleasures of consumer society, while nearby, migrants, prisoners, and soldiers were banned from plutopia--they lived in temporary ""staging grounds"" and often performed the most dangerous work at the plant. Brown shows that the plants' segregation of permanent and temporary workers and of nuclear and non-nuclear zones created a bubble of immunity, where dumps and accidents were glossed over and plant managers freely embezzled and polluted. In four decades, the Hanford plant near Richland and the Maiak plant near Ozersk each issued at least 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment--equaling four Chernobyls--laying waste to hundreds of square miles and contaminating rivers, fields, forests, and food supplies. Because of the decades of secrecy, downwind and downriver neighbors of the plutonium plants had difficulty proving what they suspected, that the rash of illnesses, cancers, and birth defects in their communities were caused by the plants' radioactive emissions. Plutopia was successful because in its zoned-off isolation it appeared to deliver the promises of the American dream and Soviet communism; in reality, it concealed disasters that remain highly unstable and threatening today.An untold and profoundly important piece of Cold War history, Plutopia invites readers to consider the nuclear footprint left by the arms race and the enormous price of paying for it.",,,2013,April 5th 2013,[],Hardcover,,9780199855766,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358752376l/16248513.jpg,4.18,"['John H.

  Prospero, the sorcerer on whose island of exile William Shakespeare set his play, The Tempest, has endured these past many centuries.

But Prospero himself has been kidnapped by demons from Hell, and Miranda, aided by her siblings, has followed her father into Hell to save him from a certain doom at the hands of vengeful demons. Time is running out for Miranda, and for the great magician himself. Their battle against the most terrifying forces of the Pit is a great fantasy adventure.

Um dos mais altos romancistas de sempre, a par to seu - tão diferente... - compatriota Dostoievski, Tolstoi legou-nos, porventura, com 'Guerra e Paz', a mais autêntica epopeia narrativa da literatura moderna. Escrita entre 1865 e 1869, curioso é notar que foi imediatamente precedida de 'Polikuchka', que escreveu em 1860 e publicou três anos depois. trata-se de uma novela de fundo popular em que toda a sua humanidade vem à superfície, levando-nos a viver as desventuras do pobre Polikuchka como se nossas fossem. É que, em Tolstoi - para empregarmos a expressão de Adolfo Casais Monteiro no sugestivo título de um dos estudos que lhe dedicou -, tudo se passa como se a própria vida falasse.Este volume inclui, para além da novela 'Polikuchka', os contos 'O Malaio', 'O Homem dos olhos brancos' e 'O assassinato de Pichel que entorna'.",,"Livros de bolso, #30",1862,April 1972,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1215978230l/3741125.jpg,3.47,[],47.0,1.0,,,,88.0,569.0,156,Europa-América,"['90', '170', '239', '56', '14']",,[],,['Leo Tolstoy']

Drawing on her memory, her parents' written reflections, interviews with contemporaries, and newly available documents, Albright recounts a tale that is by turns harrowing and inspiring. Prague Winter is an exploration of the past with timeless dilemmas in mind and, simultaneously, a journey with universal lessons that is intensely personal.The book takes readers from the Bohemian capital's thousand-year-old castle to the bomb shelters of London, from the desolate prison ghetto of Terezín to the highest councils of European and American government. Albright reflects on her discovery of her family's Jewish heritage many decades after the war, on her Czech homeland's tangled history, and on the stark moral choices faced by her parents and their generation. Often relying on eyewitness descriptions, she tells the story of how millions of ordinary citizens were ripped from familiar surroundings and forced into new roles as exiled leaders and freedom fighters, resistance organizers and collaborators, victims and killers. These events of enormous complexity are never-theless shaped by concepts familiar to any growing child: fear, trust, adaptation, the search for identity, the pressure to conform, the quest for independence, and the difference between right and wrong.""No one who lived through the years of 1937 to 1948,"" Albright writes, ""was a stranger to profound sadness. Millions of innocents did not survive, and their deaths must never be forgotten. Today we lack the power to reclaim lost lives, but we have a duty to learn all that we can about what happened and why.""

Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'World War I', 'War', 'European History', 'World History', 'France', 'Historical', 'American History']","'Without question, Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919 is the most honest and engaging history ever written about those fateful months after World War I when the maps of Europe were redrawn. Brimming with lucid analysis, elegant character sketches, and geopolitical pathos, it is essential reading.'Between January and July 1919, after ""the war to end all wars,"" men and women from around the world converged on Paris to shape the peace. Center stage, for the first time in history, was an American president, Woodrow Wilson, who with his Fourteen Points seemed to promise to so many people the fulfillment of their dreams. Stern, intransigent, impatient when it came to security concerns and wildly idealistic in his dream of a League of Nations that would resolve all future conflict peacefully, Wilson is only one of the larger-than-life characters who fill the pages of this extraordinary book. David Lloyd George, the gregarious and wily British prime minister, brought Winston Churchill and John Maynard Keynes. Lawrence of Arabia joined the Arab delegation. Ho Chi Minh, a kitchen assistant at the Ritz, submitted a petition for an independent Vietnam.For six months, Paris was effectively the center of the world as the peacemakers carved up bankrupt empires and created new countries. This book brings to life the personalities, ideals, and prejudices of the men who shaped the settlement. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China, and dismissed the Arabs. They struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews.The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; above all they failed to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made the scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. She refutes received ideas about the path from Versailles to World War II and debunks the widely accepted notion that reparations imposed on the Germans were in large part responsible for the Second World War.A landmark work of narrative history, Paris 1919 is the first full-scale treatment of the Peace Conference in more than twenty-five years. It offers a scintillating view of those dramatic and fateful days when much of the modern world was sketched out, when countries were created--Iraq, Yugoslavia, Israel--whose troubles haunt us still.Winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize, the PEN Hessell Tiltman Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize",,,09/06/01,September 9th 2003,"['David Lloyd George', 'Woodrow Wilson', 'Georges Clemenceau']",Paperback,,9780375760525,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924766l/26348.jpg,4.09,"['Arthur Ross Book Award for Silver Medal (2003)', 'Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non‐Fiction Book (2003)', 'Duff Cooper Prize (2001)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2002)', 'Hessell-Tiltman Prize (2002)']",180.0,2.0,,,,95.0,11069.0,570,Random House Trade,"['4252', '4360', '1852', '408', '197']",,[],,"['Margaret MacMillan', 'Richard Holbrooke']"

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.As funny and poignant as its predecessor, Persepolis 2 is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism. In its depiction of the struggles of growing up--here compounded by Marjane's status as an outsider both abroad and at home--it is raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating.",Persepolis #3-4,First American Paperback Edition,07/01/01,August 2nd 2005,[],Paperback,,9780375714665,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327865598l/9517.jpg,4.23,"[""Prix du Festival d'Angoulême for Alph-art du meilleur scénario (2002)""]",444.0,6.0,,,,96.0,62957.0,187,Pantheon Books,"['28694', '23041', '8833', '1700', '689']",,"['Tehran (Iran)', 'Vienna (Austria)']",,"['Marjane Satrapi', 'Anjali Singh']"

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression.

Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich,,"['Sports', 'Biography', 'Basketball', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook']","""Pistol"" is more than the biography of a ballplayer. It's the stuff of classic novels: the story of a boy transformed by his father's dream -- and the cost of that dream. Even as Pete Maravich became Pistol Pete -- a basketball icon for baby boomers -- all the Maraviches paid a price. Now acclaimed author Mark Kriegel has brilliantly captured the saga of an American family: its rise, its apparent ruin, and, finally, its redemption. Almost four decades have passed since Maravich entered the national consciousness as basketball's boy wizard. No one had ever played the game like the kid with the floppy socks and shaggy hair. And all these years later, no one else ever has. The idea of Pistol Pete continues to resonate with young people today just as powerfully as it did with their fathers.In averaging 44.2 points a game at Louisiana State University, he established records that will never be broken. But even more enduring than the numbers was the sense of ecstasy and artistry with which he played. With the ball in his hands, Maravich had a singular power to inspire awe, inflict embarrassment, or even tell a joke.But he wasn't merely a mesmerizing showman. He was basketball's answer to Elvis, a white Southerner who sold Middle America on a black man's game. Like Elvis, he paid a terrible price, becoming a prisoner of his own fame.Set largely in the South, Kriegel's ""Pistol,"" a tale of obsession and basketball, fathers and sons, merges several archetypal characters. Maravich was a child prodigy, a prodigal son, his father's ransom in a Faustian bargain, and a Great White Hope. But he was also a creature of contradictions: always the outsider but a virtuoso in a team sport, anexuberant showman who wouldn't look you in the eye, a vegetarian boozer, an athlete who lived like a rock star, a suicidal genius saved by Jesus Christ.A renowned biographer -- ""People"" magazine called him ""a master"" -- Kriegel renders his subject with a style that is, by turns, heartbreaking, lyrical, and electric.The narrative begins in 1929, the year a missionary gave Pete's father a basketball. Press Maravich had been a neglected child trapped in a hellish industrial town, but the game enabled him to blossom. It also caused him to confuse basketball with salvation. The intensity of Press's obsession initiates a journey across three generations of Maraviches. Pistol Pete, a ballplayer unlike any other, was a product of his father's vanity and vision. But that dream continues to exact a price on Pete's own sons. Now in their twenties -- and fatherless for most of their lives -- they have waged their own struggles with the game and its ghosts.""Pistol"" is an unforgettable biography. By telling one family's history, Kriegel has traced the history of the game and a large slice of the American narrative.",,,10/30/07,February 1st 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780743284974,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387713525l/119035.jpg,4.08,[],99.0,1.0,,,,94.0,6012.0,381,Free Press,"['2439', '2089', '1120', '247', '117']",,[],,['Mark Kriegel']

But those days are gone and what is left of them lies in my mother's tomb. Now I have many brothers, quick with knife and sword, and as evil as you please. We ride this broken empire and loot its corpse. They say these are violent times, the end of days when the dead roam and monsters haunt the night. All that's true enough, but there's something worse out there, in the dark.

For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister—unseen by most and unspoken of by all.The Red Queen’s grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth—drinker, gambler, seducer of women—is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it’s all a rumor—nothing that will affect him—but he is wrong.After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: he and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war—and the Red Queen controls the board.",The Red Queen's War #1,,,June 3rd 2014,[],Hardcover,,9780425268780,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385072473l/18693743.jpg,4.06,"['David Gemmell Legend Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2015)', 'David Gemmell Ravenheart Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Cover Art (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy (2014)']",94.0,1.0,,,,95.0,26515.0,355,Ace,"['9351', '11173', '4653', '996', '342']",,[],,['Mark Lawrence']
Prince of the Atlantic: An Epic Novel Based on the True Exploits of Captain Luke Ryan Irish Swashbuckler & American Patriot Benjamin Franklin's Most Dangerous Privateer,,[],"Here is a true story based on the adventures of Captain Luke Ryan - Irish swashbuckler, American patriot, mariner extraordinaire and Benjamin Franklin's most dangerous privateer... It is an epic story about war, heroism, love, intrigue and betrayal spanning a period from the American Revolution, to the French Revolution, and through the rise of Napoleon. The year is 1779 and the American Colonies are losing their life and death struggle for independence from Great Britain. Their rag-tag armies are in retreat. Their small navy has been swept from the seas. The fate of a fragile nation, the fate of the Revolution, hangs by a thread. In walks Ryan with his fast ships and iron men eager to fight the British for their own reasons. Before they are finished Ryan and his men will capture or destroy over 100 British ships, take hundreds of prisoners and invade English and Scottish towns - tying down precious military resources, causing financial panic in London and inflicting more damage on British maritime interests than perhaps any other naval force during the war. The story is told in three books: Gather the Shadowmen (The Lords of the Ocean), Prince of the Atlantic and Napoleon's Gold (which can be read in or out of sequence).",Captain Luke Ryan #2,1st Edition (Revised .1),,August 7th 2011,[],Paperback,,9780983817918,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371436653l/13318128.jpg,3.75,[],99.0,1.0,,,,75.0,4.0,327,Hephaestus Publishing,[],,[],,['Mark M.

Based on a combined 60+ years of academic expertise, elite-level coaching experience, and the observation of thousands of novice trainees, the authors present a chronological analysis of the response to exercise as it varies through the training history of the athlete, one that reflects the realities of human physiology, sports psychology, and common sense. Contrary to the one-size-fits-all models of periodization offered elsewhere, Practical Programming explains the differences in response to exercise commonly observed between athletes at the novice, intermediate, and advanced levels, explains these differences in the context of the relevant exercise science, and presents new training models that actually work for athletes at all levels of experience. Complete with new, innovative graphical representations of cutting-edge concepts in exercise programming, Practical Programming is sure to become a standard reference in the field of exercise and human performance.

To the exotic Aminpour sisters, Ireland looks like a much-needed safe haven. It has been seven years since Marjan Aminpour fled Iran with her younger sisters, Bahar and Layla, and she hopes that in Ballinacroagh, a land of “crazed sheep and dizzying roads,” they might finally find a home.From the kitchen of an old pastry shop on Main Mall, the sisters set about creating a Persian oasis. Soon sensuous wafts of cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron float through the streets–an exotic aroma that announces the opening of the Babylon Café, and a shock to a town that generally subsists on boiled cabbage and Guinness served at the local tavern. And it is an affront to the senses of Ballinacroagh’s uncrowned king, Thomas McGuire. After trying to buy the old pastry shop for years and failing, Thomas is enraged to find it occupied–and by foreigners, no less. But the mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townsfolk, and soon, business is booming. Marjan is thrilled with the demand for her red lentil soup, abgusht stew, and rosewater baklava–and with the transformation in her sisters. Young Layla finds first love, and even tense, haunted Bahar seems to be less nervous. And in the stand-up-comedian-turned-priest Father Fergal Mahoney, the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico, and the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey, the sisters find a merry band of supporters against the close-minded opposition of less welcoming villagers stuck in their ways. But the idyll is soon broken when the past rushes back to threaten the Amnipours once more, and the lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran bleed into the present. Infused with the textures and scents, trials and triumph,s of two distinct cultures, Pomegranate Soup is an infectious novel of magical realism.

Parmenides,,['Philosophy'],"Parmenides, a lecture course delivered by Martin Heidegger at the University of Freiburg in 1942-1943, presents a highly original interpretation of ancient Greek philosophy. A major contribution to Heidegger's provocative dialogue with the pre-Socratics, the book attacks some of the most firmly established conceptions of Greek thinking and of the Greek world. The central theme is the question of truth and the primordial understanding of truth to be found in Parmenides' ""didactic poem."" Heidegger highlights the contrast between Greek and Roman thought and the reflection of that contrast in language. He analyzes the decline in the primordial understanding of truth--and, just as importantly, of untruth--that began in later Greek philosophy and that continues, by virtue of the Latinization of the West, down to the present day. Beyond an interpretation of Greek philosophy, Parmenides (volume 54 of Heidegger's Collected Works) offers a strident critique of the contemporary world, delivered during a time that Heidegger described as ""out of joint.""",Studies in Continental Thought,,11/06/44,July 1st 1998,[],Paperback,,9780253212146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347680406l/314926.jpg,4.48,[],82.0,1.0,,,,98.0,217.0,192,Indiana University Press,"['141', '45', '27', '3', '1']",,[],,"['Martin Heidegger', 'Richard Rojcewicz', 'Andre Schuwer']"

Precious Bane,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', '20th Century']","A compelling story of passion, with an enduring air of enchantment throughout, Precious Bane is a novel that haunts us with its beauty and its timeless truths about our deepest hopes. Set in Shropshire in the 1800s, it is alive with the many moods of Nature, benevolent and violent and the many moods -- equally benevolent and violent -- of the people making lives there. Prue Sarn is an unlikely heroine, born with a facial disfiguration which the Fates have dictated will deny her love. But Prue has strength far beyond her handicap, and this woman, suspected of witchcraft by her fellow townspeople, rises above them all through an all-encompassing sweetness of spirit. Precious Bane is also the story of Gideon, Prue's doomed brother, equally strong-willed, but with other motives. Determined to defeat the poverty of their farm, he devotes all his energies to making money. His only diversion from this ambition, he abandons her for the stronger drive of his money lust. And finally, it is the story of Kester Woodseaves, whose steady love for all created things leads him to resist people's cruelty toward nature and each other, and whose love for Prue Sarn enables him to discern her natural loveliness beneath her blighted appearance. Rebecca West, a contemporary of Mary Webb, called her, simply, ""a genius,"" and G. K. Chesterton, another contemporary, asserted: ""the light in the stories . . . is a light not shining on the things but through them."" Critic Hilda Addison summed up Precious Bane: ""The book opens with one of those simple sentences which haunt the mind until the curiosity has been satisfied . . . It strikes a note which never fails throughout; it opens with a beauty which is justified to the last sentence."" When the book was first published in 1926 in America, the New York Times Book Review predicted: "" on some bookshelves, we feel sure, Precious Bane will find almost a hallowed place."" ",,,10/28/24,August 31st 1990,[],Paperback,,9780268015381,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372298878l/779509.jpg,4.22,['Prix Femina Vie Heureuse Anglais (1926)'],611.0,7.0,,,,95.0,2425.0,328,University of Notre Dame Press,"['1166', '776', '364', '85', '34']",,[],,['Mary Webb']

Prince,,"['Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction']","Legendarily reticent, perverse and misleading, Prince is one of the few remaining 80s superstars who still, perhaps, remains unexplained. Now a firm fixture in the pop canon, where such classics as ""Purple Rain"", ""Sign o' the Times"" and ""Parade"" regularly feature in Best Ever Album polls, Prince is still, as he ever was, an enigma. His live performances are legendary (21 Nights at the O2 in 2007) and while recent releases have been modestly successful at best, his influence on urban music, and R'n'B in particular, has never been more evident. The Minneapolis Sound can now be heard everywhere. Matt Thorne's ""Prince"", through years of research and interviews with ex-Revolution members such as Wendy and Lisa, is an account of a pop maverick whose experiments with rock, funk, techno and jazz revolutionized pop.

The treatments they developed changed the course of medical history. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 spelled the end of the Victorian Age and the beginning of the ""American Century.""

Pixy,,"['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Graphic Novels Comics']","They've been ejected into the street because their apartment was put to sleep, Angina had to abort their child (the result of a malfunctioning Safe-Sex bodysuit) — how could it get worse? When a friendly stranger offers them his apartment, things seem to be looking up... but then Angina gets a call from the Netherworld. It's her aborted fetus: he's drunk and he's pissed off. So begins Pixy, which Neil Gaiman calls ""the best comic I've read this year"" — a 65-page journey into a nightmare world unlike any you've ever seen before. The rest of the book follows Alka's attempts to infiltrate the Kingdom of the Dead (where time runs backwards and is sold by the pint to time-addicts), in order to track down the malevolent Pixy and kill him for good. Shedding bodies and identities with some regularity (Pixy himself blows one to smithereens), Alka finds his own sense of reality eroding further and further during his sojourn down under — and it doesn't help at all when Pixy, now his best friend, accompanies him back up to the Land of the Living, where the gun-happy undead sprite wreaks unspeakable havoc. Pixy is the first major work by Swedish cartoonist Max Andersson, and it combines the freewheeling-yet-obsessive graphic and narrative weirdness of such contemporary North American cartoonists as Chester Brown, Julie Doucet, Kaz and Charles Burns with a bizarre yet coherent story that mixes coal black humor, barbed satire, wild surrealism, and stark horror in a totally new way — a feast for the (preferably deranged) mind and the (preferably diseased) eye.",,,01/01/92,January 17th 1996,[],Paperback,,9781560971313,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172203059l/149512.jpg,4.37,[],50.0,1.0,,,,97.0,155.0,72,Fantagraphics,"['86', '46', '19', '2', '2']",,[],,['Max Andersson']

Per amore di una donna,,"['Fiction', 'Israel', 'Historical Fiction', 'Jewish', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Cultural', 'Roman', '20th Century', 'Romance']","Nevicò quel giorno, il 6 febbraio 1950, nella fertile valle di Iezreel, e Moshe Rabinovich si scagliò furiosamente con l'ascia contro un eucalipto secolare, un simbolo per tutti gli abitanti del villaggio, ma per lui soprattutto un mezzo attraverso cui si sarebbe attuato un tragico destino. Da questo episodio epocale per la memoria della piccola comunità, si diparte il lungo racconto di Zayde, il protagonista - ragazzino e poi uomo - che accompagna il lettore in un suggestivo viaggio sul filo dei ricordi. Al centro della storia è Yehudit, madre di Zayde, una donna forte e indipendente, custode di una sofferenza viscerale e di un lacerante segreto. Tre figure maschili si alternano sulla scena: sono gli uomini, diversissimi tra loro, che si contendono l'amore di Yehudit e la paternità di Zayde, occupandosene generosamente a modo proprio e secondo i propri mezzi. Mescolando voci ed episodi, passato e presente, Zayde ricrea una fitta trama di rapporti personali, di fatti che si intersecano per arrivare a ricostruire un mosaico esistenziale collettivo al cui centro campeggia il mistero di Yehudit, sfuggente e inarrivabile. Dominata dall'idea di un destino ineluttabile che grava su tutti ""smisurato e indifferente"", la narrazione procede secondo un ritmo pacato, scandito dai suoni, dai profumi - indimenticabili quelli delle prelibate cene che Yaakov, uno dei padri, prepara a Zayde - e dagli eventi di un microcosmo rurale che assurge a emblema universale.",,,01/01/94,2006,[],Paperback,,9788882749279,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401817359l/12494271.jpg,4.1,[],100.0,1.0,,,,94.0,880.0,409,Frassinelli,"['354', '325', '146', '43', '12']",,[],,"['Meir Shalev', 'Elena Loewenthal']"

Port Royal, Jamaica′s capital, a cut-throat town of taverns, grog shops, and bawdy houses, is devoid of London′s luxuries; life here can end swiftly with dysentery or a dagger in your back. But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island′s code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor′s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island′s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake.

Physics of the Impossible,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Popular Science', 'Technology', 'Astronomy', 'Space', 'Time Travel', 'Audiobook', 'Reference']","A fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible—from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks—revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future.One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build oneKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it.

Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100,,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'Technology', 'Popular Science', 'Futurism', 'Audiobook', 'Engineering', 'History', 'Philosophy']","Imagine, if you can, the world in the year 2100.In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku—the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible—gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world's top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye.Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically.In space, radically new ships—needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion—could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth's atmosphere at the push of a button.But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper?All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

  In the latest electrifying adventure in Tom Clancy's #1 New York Times bestselling series, Jack Ryan, Jr., learns that sometimes the deadliest secret may be standing right next to you.
Former U.S. Senator Weston Rhodes is a defense contractor with an urgent problem. His company needs someone to look over the books of Dalfan Technologies, a Singapore company—quickly. He turns to his old friend Gerry Hendley for help. Hendley Associates is one of the best financial analysis firms in the country and the cover for The Campus, a top-secret American intelligence agency. Rhodes asks for two specific analysts, Jack Ryan Jr., and Paul Brown, a mild-mannered forensic accountant.Both Ryan and Brown initially resist, for different reasons. On the long flight over, Ryan worries he’s being sidelined from the next Campus operation in America’s war on terror. Brown—who was never very good with people—only worries about the numbers, and finding a good cup of tea.Brown has no idea Jack works for The Campus but the awkward accountant is hiding secrets of his own. Rhodes has tasked him with uploading a cyberwarfare program into the highly secure Dalfan Technologies mainframe on behalf of the CIA.On the verge of mission success, Brown discovers a game within the game, and the people who now want to kill him are as deadly as the cyclone bearing down on the island nation.

Putas y Guerrilleras,,['Nonfiction'],"""Los represores les decían putas y guerrilleras. Les gritaban eso apenas las secuestraban y lo repetían una y otra vez durante sus estadías en el infierno. Es lo que cuentan Miriam Lewin y Olga Wornat, militantes en su juventud y periodistas de renombre desde hace décadas, en, tal vez, el libro más descarnado, honesto y conmovedor sobre lo que ocurrió en los centros clandestinos de detención en la década de 1970. Son decenas de historias silenciadas, de confesiones largamente elaboradas incluidas las de las autoras y de una rebelión contra el relato oficial sobre esos años. No sólo hay cuestionamientos a los militares y a los integrantes de otras fuerzas de seguridad, a los funcionarios y al sistema judicial, sino también a las organizaciones guerrilleras y al pensamiento machista generalizado en todos los sectores de la sociedad. Las mujeres que protagonizan estos hechos fueron víctimas, a lo largo y a lo ancho del país, de torturas, abusos, violaciones y, en ocasiones, mantuvieron relaciones tortuosas, nacidas bajo tormentos, con sus victimarios. Muchas de ellas sobrevivieron. Cargaron como pudieron con sus pesadillas. Algunas rehicieron sus vidas, otras ya no pudieron hacerlo. Fueron señaladas y acusadas hasta por sus propios compañeros de militancia. O esperaron muchísimos años para que un juez condenara a los responsables de esos crímenes sexuales. Un castigo doble o triple, feroz e impensado, espeluznante. Existe la idea de que ya se dijo todo lo que había por decir sobre los años de plomo.

First published to critical acclaim in 1929, Passing firmly established Nella Larsen's prominence among women writers of the Harlem Renaissance. The Modern Library is proud to present Passing—an electrifying story of two women who cross the color line in 1920s New York—together with a new Introduction by the Obie Award- winning playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange.Irene Redfield, the novel's protagonist, is a woman with an enviable life. She and her husband, Brian, a prominent physician, share a comfortable Harlem town house with their sons. Her work arranging charity balls that gather Harlem's elite creates a sense of purpose and respectability for Irene. But her hold on this world begins to slip the day she encounters Clare Kendry, a childhood friend with whom she had lost touch. Clare—light-skinned, beautiful, and charming—tells Irene how, after her father's death, she left behind the black neighborhood of her adolescence and began passing for white, hiding her true identity from everyone, including her racist husband. As Clare begins inserting herself into Irene's life, Irene is thrown into a panic, terrified of the consequences of Clare's dangerous behavior. And when Clare witnesses the vibrancy and energy of the community she left behind, her burning desire to come back threatens to shatter her careful deception.Brilliantly plotted and elegantly written, Passing offers a gripping psychological portrait of emotional extremity.",,Penguin Classics,10/28/29,April 24th 2003,"['Irene Redfield', 'Clare Kendry', 'Brian Redfield', 'Gertrude Martin', 'Hugh Wentworth', 'John Bellow']",Paperback,,9780142437278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388214730l/349929.jpg,3.88,[],272.0,4.0,,,,94.0,22003.0,122,Penguin,"['5549', '9625', '5579', '1038', '212']",,"['Chicago, Illinois (United States)', 'New York City, New York (United States)', 'Harlem, New York City, New York (United States)', 'United States of America', 'New York State (United States)']",,"['Nella Larsen', 'Ntozake Shange', 'Thadious Davis']"

"Power, Sex, Suicide",Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life,Science,"Mitochondria are tiny structures located inside our cells that carry out the essential task of producing energy for the cell. They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

That's why even those who seek power in order to bring about radical change so often fail, despite their best intentions. Osho looks at where this ""will to power"" comes from, how it expresses itself not only in political institutions, but in our everyday relationships. In the process, he offers a vision of relationships and society based not on power over others, but on a recognition of the uniqueness of every individual.Power, Politics, and Change includes an original talk by Osho on DVD.

Jika pada jilid I digambarkan terutama tentang kedigdayaan Jerman di medan perang sehingga bisa menguasai daratan Eropa dan afrika bagian utara (nyaris saja termasuk Uni Sovyet) tanpa ada perlawanan yang berarti dari negara yang diinvasinya, maka jilid II ini menggambarkan sebaliknya. Sekutu strikes back! Mungkin ini kalimat yang tepat menggambarkan keseluruhan buku ini.Walaupun dalam jilid I sudah mulai digambarkan sedikit pada bagian akhir buku itu tentang sekutu yang mulai unggul di kawasan afrika utara, jilid II ini menggambarkan lebih banyak lagi keunggulan sekutu di medan perang. Penggambaran keunggulan itu terutama penguasaan itali hingga hingga penyerbuan oleh angkatan udara sekutu ke pabrik penyulingan minyak di rumania juga penyerangan ke beberapa kota di jerman.Selain itu juga, digambarkan peranan para pejuang-pejuang bawah tanah di negara-negara dataran eropa yang berusaha mengusir pasukan jerman dari tanah airnya. Sehingga muncul nama-nama pemimpin pemberontakan itu seperti joseph broz tito di yugoslavia, odette di perancis, odd starheim di norwegia, dan beberapa orang di polandia.Unuk masalah teknologi perang, digambarkan juga beberapa teknologi dan persenjataan yang digunakan selama perang. Terakhir, yang juga ditonjolkan dalam buku ini adalah hubugan antara inggris dan amerika yang tergabung dalam sekutu. Digambarkan bagaimana perbedaan pemikiran diantaranya keduanya dan juga kerjasama yang dilakukan.",Perang Eropa,,,2004,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1224860150l/1387654.jpg,4.21,[],73.0,1.0,,,,97.0,337.0,410,Penerbit Buku Kompas,"['155', '113', '58', '7', '4']",,[],,['P.

Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed,,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'Horror', 'British Literature']","Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus.In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror.  An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End.  Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim.  And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun.  He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene.  Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel.  But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death.  Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer.In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history.  Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert.It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she.   Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate.  She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press.  Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created.New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include:- How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...",,,10/28/02,November 2003,['Jack the Ripper'],Mass Market Paperback,,9780425192733,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388307107l/6538.jpg,3.47,[],326.0,5.0,,,,80.0,33479.0,383,Berkley,"['7714', '9191', '9902', '4476', '2196']",,[],,['Patricia Cornwell']

These are today's sins of science—as deplorable as mistaken past ideas about advocating racial purity or using lobotomies as a cure for mental illness. These unwitting errors add up to seven lessons both cautionary and profound, narrated by renowned author and speaker Paul A. Offit.

Pop Internationalism,,Business & Economics,"""Pop internationalists""--people who speak impressively about international trade while ignoring basic economics and misusing economic figures are the target of this collection of Paul Krugman's most recent essays. In the clear, readable, entertaining style that brought acclaim for his best-selling Age of Diminished Expectations, Krugman explains what real economic analysis is. He discusses economic terms and measurements, like ""value-added"" and GDP, in simple language so that readers can understand how pop internationalists distort, and sometimes contradict, the most basic truths about world trade. All but two of the essays have previously appeared in such publications as Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, and the Harvard Business Review. The first five essays take on exaggerations of foreign competition's effects on the U.S. economy and represent Krugman's central criticisms of public debate over world trade. The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom.

Practical Ethics,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Politics', 'Academic', 'Animals', 'Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Social Science', 'Society']","Peter Singer's remarkably clear and comprehensive Practical Ethics has become a classic introduction to applied ethics since its publication in 1979 and has been translated into many languages. For this second edition the author has revised all the existing chapters, added two new ones, and updated the bibliography. He has also added an appendix describing some of the deep misunderstanding of, and consequent violent reaction to, the book in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where the book has tested the limits of freedom of speech. The focus of the book is the application of ethics to difficult and controversial social questions: equality and discrimination by race, sex, ability, or species; abortion, euthanasia, and embryo experimentation; the moral status of animals; political violence and civil disobedience; overseas aid and the obligation to assist others; responsibility for the environment; the treatment of refugees. Singer explains and assesses relevant arguments in a perspicuous, non-doctrinaire way. He structures the book to show how contemporary controversies often have deep philosophical roots; and he presents an ethical theory of his own that can be applied consistently and convincingly to all the practical cases. The book's primary readership remains teachers and students of ethics whether in philosophy or some other branch of the humanities or social sciences. However, such is the clarity of the book's style and structure that it should interest any thinking person concerned with the most difficult social problems facing us as we approach the twenty-first century.",,,10/29/79,January 29th 1993,[],Paperback,,9780521439718,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388357565l/29378.jpg,4.06,[],244.0,3.0,,,,94.0,2670.0,411,Cambridge University Press,"['997', '1057', '450', '123', '43']",,[],,['Peter Singer']

An idealistic and reclusive figure, Pol Pot sought to instill in his people values of moral purity and self-abnegation through a revolution of radical egalitarianism. In the process his country descended into madness, becoming a concentration camp of the mind, a slave state in which obedience was enforced on the killing fields.How did a utopian dream of shared prosperity mutate into one of the worst nightmares humanity has ever known? To understand this almost inconceivable mystery, Philip Short explores Pol Pot's life from his early years to his death. Short spent four years traveling throughout Cambodia interviewing the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge movement, many of whom have never spoken before, including Pol Pot's brother-in-law and the former Khmer Rouge head of state. He also sifted through the previously closed archives of China, Russia, Vietnam, and Cambodia itself to trace the fate of one man and the nation that he led into ruin.This powerful biography reveals that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were not a one-off aberration but instead grew out of a darkness of the soul common to all peoples.

In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research.

Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man.Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller.

Phaedrus,"And, The Seventh and Eighth Letters",Philosophy,"Set in the idyllic countryside outside Athens, the Phraedrusis a dialogue between the philosopher Socrates and his friend Phaedrus, inspired by their reading of a clumsy speech by the writer Lysias on the nature of love. Their conversation develops into a wide-ranging discussion on such subjects as the pursuit of beauty, the immortality of the soul and the attainment of truth, and ends with an in-depth consideration of the principles of rhetoric. Probably a work of Plato's maturity, the Phaedrusrepresents a high point in his achievement as a writer.

Plato in twelve volumes,Symposium ; Gorgias. Lysis,Literary Criticism,"Plato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.",,,,1975.0,,,0674991842,9780674991842,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRaDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.39,,,,,,,,,560.0,,,426.0,,,['Plato']

Parallel Lives,,"['History', 'Classics', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Ancient History', 'Greece', 'Ancient', 'Historical', 'Roman']","Plutarch's Parallel Lives is a series of biographies, arranged in pairs illuminating virtues & vices. Surviving Lives contain 23 pairs, each with a Greek & a Roman Life, & 4 unpaired Lives. As explained in the opening of his Life of Alexander, he wasn't concerned with history so much as the influence of character on life & destiny. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on great events, he devoted much space to anecdote & incidental triviality, this often telling more about his subjects than their famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to painting. Indeed, he went to great (often tenuous) length to draw parallels between physical appearance & character. He's amongst the earliest moral philosophers. Some of the Lives, like those of Heracles, Philip II of Macedon & Scipio Africanus, are lost. Many remaining Lives are truncated, contain lacunae or have been tampered with. Extant are those on Solon, Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles, Alcibiades, Nicias, Demosthenes, Pelopidas, Philopoemen, Timoleon, Dion of Syracuse, Alexander the Great, Pyrrhus of Epirus, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Coriolanus, Theseus, Aemilius Paullus, Tiberius Gracchus, Gaius Gracchus, Gaius Marius, Sulla, Sertorius, Lucullus, Pompey, Julius Caesar, Cicero, Cato the Younger, Mark Antony & Marcus Junius Brutus.",,,10/28/00,August 12th 1977,[],Hardcover,,9780394604077,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365654635l/3679100.jpg,4.13,[],262.0,3.0,,,,94.0,1455.0,1309,Modern Library,"['628', '485', '260', '64', '18']",,[],,"['Plutarch', 'Arthur Hugh Clough', 'John Dryden']"

Parallel Stories: A Novel,,"['Fiction', 'Hungary', 'Historical Fiction', 'Hungarian Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', '21st Century']","In 1989, the memorable year when the Wall came down, a university student in Berlin on his early morning run finds a corpse lying on a park bench and alerts the authorities. This classic police-procedural scene opens an extraordinary novel, a masterwork that traces the fate of myriad Europeans - Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Gypsies - across the treacherous years of the mid-twentieth century. The social and political circumstances of their lives may vary richly, their sexual and spiritual longings may seem to each of them entirely unique, yet Peter N das's magnificent tapestry unveils uncanny, reverberating parallels that link them across time and space.Three unusual men are at the heart of Parallel Stories: Hans von Wolkenstein, whose German mother is linked to dark secrets of fascist-Nazi collaboration during the 1940s, Agost Lippay-Lehr, whose influential father has served Hungary's different political regimes for decades, and Andras Rott, who has his own dark record of dark activities abroad. They are friends in Budapest when we eventually meet them in the spring of 1961, a pivotal time in the postwar epoch and in their clandestine careers. But the richly detailed, dramatic memories and actions of these men, like those of their friends, lovers and family members, range from Berlin and Moscow to Switzerland and Holland, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, and of course, across Hungary. The ever-daring, ever-original episodes of Parallel Lives explore the most intimate, most difficult human experiences in a prose glowing with uncommon clarity and also with mysterious uncertainty - as is characteristic of Nadas's subtle, spirited art.The web of extended dramas in Parallel Stories reaches not just forward to the transformative year of 1989 but back to the spring of 1939, with Europe trembling on the edge of war; to the bestial times of 1944-45, when Budapest was besieged, the final solution devastated Hungary's Jews, and the war came to an end; and to the cataclysmic Hungarian Revolution of October 1956. But there is much more to Parallel Stories than that: it is a daring, demanding, and very moving exploration of humanity at its most constrained and its most free.",,,10/30/05,November 27th 2012,[],Paperback,,9781250013903,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346671767l/13513468.jpg,3.71,"['Internationaler Literaturpreis – Haus der Kulturen der Welt Nominee (2012)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Brücke-Berlin-Preis (Brücke Berlin Literature and Translation Prize) for Christina Viragh (2012)']",97.0,1.0,,,,82.0,414.0,1133,Picador,"['142', '118', '79', '41', '34']",,[],,"['Péter Nádas', 'Imre Goldstein']"

Take one of the most significant milestones in a child’s life—potty training—add loads of silliness, and the result is the perfect book for the toilet-training set (and their parents). Potty Palooza is a fun and informative step-by-step guide that kids will love to hear read aloud as they sit on the potty.Written from the perspective of an eager and curious toddler (and, unlike other potty-training books, designed to teach both boys and girls), this charmingly illustrated book celebrates every successful trip to the bathroom with a “potty palooza” and stars an endearing and quirky cast of characters: potty hippos, who gather when you use too much toilet paper; space aliens, who zoom in to try to use your potty; a wild elephant; and the Poop Police, who issue Mom or Dad a ticket for sounding too silly when singing the “Potty Song.”Toddlers will giggle as they learn the answers to all their questions: Will I fall in? (No, you’re way too big.) How often will I be using the potty? (As often as you feel like you need to poop or pee.) Is it true that everyone poops, even the president of the United States? (Yes, everyone poops!) The book also includes fun poop and pee facts, a parents’ guide written by a board-certified pediatrician, and a potty chart with stickers to track progress.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.Here is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.",,,10/28/11,September 19th 2017,[],Audio CD,,9781508243243,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503365703l/34536488._SX318_.jpg,4.12,[],368.0,4.0,,,,93.0,32123.0,592,Simon Schuster Audio,"['14288', '10448', '5045', '1575', '767']",,[],,"['Ray Dalio', 'Jeremy Bobb']"

Answer: Postmodernism. But what exactly is postmodernism? This graphic guide explains clearly the maddeningly enigmatic concept that has been used to define the world's cultural condition over the last three decades. ""Introducing Postmodernism"" tracks the idea back to its roots by taking a tour of some of the most extreme and exhilarating events, people and thought of the last 100 years: in art - constructivism, conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol; in politics and history - McCarthy's witch-hunts, feminism, Francis Fukuyama and the Holocaust; in philosophy - the work of Derrida, Baudrillard, Foucault and Heidegger. The book also explores postmodernism's take on today, and the anxious grip of globalization, unpredictable terrorism and unforeseen war that greeted the dawn of the 21st century.

Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,,Philosophy,"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature hit the philosophical world like a bombshell. Richard Rorty, a Princeton professor who had contributed to the analytic tradition in philosophy, was now attempting to shrug off all the central problems with which it had long been preoccupied. After publication, the Press was barely able to keep up with demand, and the book has since gone on to become one of its all-time best-sellers in philosophy. Rorty argued that, beginning in the seventeenth century, philosophers developed an unhealthy obsession with the notion of representation. They compared the mind to a mirror that reflects reality. In their view, knowledge is concerned with the accuracy of these reflections, and the strategy employed to obtain this knowledge--that of inspecting, repairing, and polishing the mirror--belongs to philosophy. Rorty's book was a powerful critique of this imagery and the tradition of thought that it spawned. He argued that the questions about truth posed by Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and modern epistemologists and philosophers of language simply couldn't be answered and were, in any case, irrelevant to serious social and cultural inquiry. This stance provoked a barrage of criticism, but whatever the strengths of Rorty's specific claims, the book had a therapeutic effect on philosophy. It reenergized pragmatism as an intellectual force, steered philosophy back to its roots in the humanities, and helped to make alternatives to analytic philosophy a serious choice for young graduate students. Twenty-five years later, the book remains a must-read for anyone seriously concerned about the nature of philosophical inquiry and what philosophers can and cannot do to help us understand and improve the world.",,,,1980.0,,,0691020167,9780691020167,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cxYFw3NkPMoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.0,,,,,,,,,424.0,,,2720.0,,,['Richard Rorty']

Relive the adventure from the beginning with this boxed set of the first three books with glorious new cover art by John Rocco.
  The Lightning Thief
Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe—Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends—a satyr and another the demigod daughter of Athena—Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.
  The Sea of Monsters
After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters—the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia—only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclops by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family—one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke…
  The Titan's Curse
When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty bronze sword Riptide; and…a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan's curse.",Percy Jackson and the Olympians #1-3,Boxed Set,,September 16th 2008,[],Board Book,,9781423113492,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181482l/3165162.jpg,4.59,[],6214.0,85.0,,,,98.0,39475.0,1032,Hyperion Books for Children,"['27941', '7921', '2774', '500', '339']",,[],,['Rick Riordan']

Robert Fisk's explosive Pity the Nation recounts Sharon and Arafat's first deadly encounter in Lebanon in the early 1980s and explains why the Israel–Palestine relationship seems so intractable. A remarkable combination of war reporting and analysis by an author who has witnessed the carnage of Beirut for twenty-five years, Fisk, the first journalist to whom bin Laden announced his jihad against the U.S., is one of the world's most fearless and honored foreign correspondents. He spares no one in this saga of the civil war and subsequent Israeli invasion: the PLO, whose thuggish behavior alienated most Lebanese; the various Lebanese factions, whose appalling brutality spared no one; the Syrians, who supported first the Christians and then the Muslims in their attempt to control Lebanon; and the Israelis, who tried to install their own puppets and, with their 1982 invasion, committed massive war crimes of their own. It includes a moving finale that recounts the travails of Fisk's friend Terry Anderson who was kidnapped by Hezbollah and spent 2,454 days in captivity. Fully updated to include the Israeli withdrawl from south Lebanon and Ariel Sharon's electoral victory over Ehud Barak, this edition has sixty pages of new material and a new preface.

The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum.

And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him.With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.",,,11/21/03,November 8th 2005,"['Attilius', 'Corelia', 'Ampliatus', 'Pliny']",Paperback,,9780812974614,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388189565l/880.jpg,3.82,[],233.0,3.0,,,,93.0,35835.0,274,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['8844', '14873', '9519', '2114', '485']",,['Pompeii (Italy)'],,['Robert Harris']

Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject,,"['Feminism', 'Islam', 'Religion', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Academic', 'Gender', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Theory']","Politics of Piety is a groundbreaking analysis of Islamist cultural politics through the ethnography of a thriving, grassroots women's piety movement in the mosques of Cairo, Egypt. Unlike those organized Islamist activities that seek to seize or transform the state, this is a moral reform movement whose orthodox practices are commonly viewed as inconsequential to Egypt's political landscape. Saba Mahmood's compelling exposition of these practices challenges this assumption by showing how the ethical and the political are indelibly linked within the context of such movements.Not only is this book a sensitive ethnography of a critical but largely ignored dimension of the Islamic revival, it is also an unflinching critique of the secular-liberal principles by which some people hold such movements to account. The book addresses three central questions: How do movements of moral reform help us rethink the normative liberal account of politics? How does the adherence of women to the patriarchal norms at the core of such movements parochialize key assumptions within feminist theory about freedom, agency, authority, and the human subject? How does a consideration of debates about embodied religious rituals among Islamists and their secular critics help us understand the conceptual relationship between bodily form and political imaginaries?

The only problem is that Sam is really Lady Samantha, daughter of the seventeenth Duke of Haywood, and if her father has his way, she’ll be marrying a Paladin, not becoming one. But Sam has never held much interest in playing damsel-in-distress, and so she rescues herself from a lifetime of boredom and matrimonial drudgery.

Pamela,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', '18th Century', 'Romance', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'School', 'Novels', 'English Literature', 'Historical Fiction']","One of the most spectacular successes of the flourishing literary marketplace of eighteenth-century London, Pamela also marked a defining moment in the emergence of the modern novel. In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world ""into two different Parties, Pamelists and Anti-pamelists,"" even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day.

Parrish,,"['Paranormal', 'Romance', 'Ghosts', 'Mystery', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Horror', 'Cozy Mystery']","Sadie Smith was absolutely certain of three things: (1) ghosts were indisputably real; (2) she and her three friends were some of the best (though not the most successful) ghost hunters in Oregon; (3) her teammate Jefferson Parrish was always the scariest thing in the room. In a face-off between supernatural beings and Jefferson's Tim Burton-esque vibe there really was no contest. But ghosts—unsurprisingly—can’t help pay the rent. So when Sadie and her friends are offered an undisclosed sum of money from an anonymous client to find a link between four historical haunted locations, it’s an easy sell. During their cross-country investigation, Sadie finds herself forgetting about Jefferson’s macabre tendencies and falling for his sweetness, even if his idea of a love letter reads more like a note from a serial killer. And she can’t stop thinking about his annoyingly irresistible deep green eyes. As Sadie’s feelings get more tangled up with Jefferson, their group puts together the final pieces of a 100 year old mystery—one that will change Sadie’s life forever.

  Slave, soldier, lover, hero, saint,—his life mirrored the cataclysmic world into which he was born. His memory will outlast the ages.
Born of a noble Welsh family, he is violently torn from his home by Irish raiders at age sixteen and sold as a slave to a brutal wilderness king. Rescued by the king's druids from almost certain death, he learns the arts of healing and song, and the mystical ways of a secretive order whose teachings tantalize with hints at a deeper wisdom. Yet young Succat Morgannwg cannot rest until he sheds the strangling yoke of slavery and returns to his homeland across the sea. He pursues his dream of freedom through horrific war and shattering tragedy—through great love and greater loss—from a dying, decimated Wales to the bloody battlefields of Gaul to the fading majesty of Rome. And in the twilight of a once-supreme empire, he is transformed yet again by divine hand and a passionate vision of ""truth against the world,"" accepting the name that will one day become legend . . .

Praying Through Cancer is a collection of stories by women who have faced cancer and, with triumphant spirits, found comfort and sometimes even joy in the midst of it.For these women, cancer was a comma, not a period, in the sentences of their lives. Why? Because they put their faith in the Lord and He strengthened them beyond comprehension.

His works stand out for the variety in their forms of artistic expression. His Tunisian water-colours depicting landscape, architecture and, above all, the North African light of this Mediterranean land constitute the true beginning of Klee's painting career. Although these paintings still fall under the heading of ""objective"", they already exhibit indications of his tendency toward abstraction and a language of forms. Geometrical figures and hieroglyphic elements characterize the majority of these works, which for this reason seem reminiscent of ""naive"" and playful children's painting.

Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong,,"['Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Jazz', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'American History', 'Memoir', 'African American Literature', 'Musicians']","Product Description Louis Armstrong was the greatest jazz musician of the twentieth century and a giant of modern American culture. He knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts, wrote the finest of all jazz autobiographies--without a collaborator--and created collages that have been compared to the art of Romare Bearden. The ranks of his admirers included Johnny Cash, Jackson Pollock and Orson Welles. Offstage he was witty, introspective and unexpectedly complex, a beloved colleague with an explosive temper whose larger-than-life personality was tougher and more sharp-edged than his worshipping fans ever knew. Wall Street Journal arts columnist Terry Teachout has drawn on a cache of important new sources unavailable to previous Armstrong biographers, including hundreds of private recordings of backstage and after-hours conversations that Armstrong made throughout the second half of his life, to craft a sweeping new narrative biography of this towering figure that shares full, accurate versions of such storied events as Armstrong's decision to break up his big band and his quarrel with President Eisenhower for the first time. Certain to be the definitive word on Armstrong for our generation, Pops paints a gripping portrait of the man, his world and his music that will stand alongside Gary Giddins' Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams and Peter Guralnick's Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley as a classic biography of a major American musician.      Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Terry Teachout, Author of Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong[image]  Dear Amazon Readers: Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong, my new book, is the story of a great artist who was also a good man. A genius who was born in the gutter--and became a celebrity known in every corner of the world. A beloved entertainer who was more complex--and much tougher--than his fans ever imagined. It's not the first Armstrong biography, but it's the first one to tell Satchmo's story accurately. I based it in part on hundreds of private, after-hours recordings made by Armstrong himself, candid tapes in which he tells the amazing tale of his ascent to stardom in blunt, plainspoken language. I'm the first biographer to have had access to those tapes. Read Pops and you'll learn the facts about his 1930 marijuana arrest, his life-threatening run-in with the gangsters of Chicago, his triumphant Broadway and Hollywood debuts, his complicated love life, and much, much more. You'll also come away understanding exactly what it was that made him the most influential jazz musician of the twentieth century, an entertainer so irresistibly magnetic that he knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts four decades after he cut his first record. If you've ever thrilled to the sounds of ""West End Blues,"" ""Mack the Knife,"" ""Hello, Dolly!"" or ""What a Wonderful World,"" this is the book for you and yours. Give Pops a read and find out all about the man from New Orleans who changed the face of American music. Sincerely yours, Terry Teachout (Photo © Ken Howard)      Amazon Exclusive: Terry Teachout's Top 10 Louis Armstrong Recordings  In Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong, I tell the story of a beloved giant of jazz whose greathearted, larger-than-life personality shone through every record he made. Here are ten of my special favorites: 1. ""I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues"" (1933). Of all Louis Armstrong's records, this is the one I love best. Listen to how he floats atop the beat in the last chorus--he sounds just like a tenor going for a high C. 2. ""West End Blues"" (1928). The most celebrated of all Armstrong recordings and the quintessence of swing."" 3. ""Hotter Than That"" (1927). “I just played the way I sang,"" Pops said. His wordless vocal on this Hot Seven track proves it. 4. ""Star Dust"" (1931). Further proof: listen to how he rewrites the lyrics to this familiar Hoagy Carmichael ballad. 5. ""Darling Nelly Gray"" (1937). Satchmo transforms an old slave song, backed up by the suavely swinging Mills Brothers. 6. ""Jeepers Creepers"" (1939). A charming souvenir of Armstrong's film career--he introduced this Johnny Mercer song in ""Going Places."" 7. ""Struttin' with Some Barbecue"" (1938). A boiling-hot big-band remake of a classic 1927 Hot Five side in which the trumpeter improves on perfection. 8. ""You Rascal, You"" (1950). Louis meets Louis in this raucous romp through an Armstrong standard, accompanied to high-spirited effect by Louis Jordan's Tympany Five. 9. ""New Orleans Function"" (1950). An old-time New Orleans jazz funeral recreated by the All Stars, with Earl Hines on piano and Jack Teagarden on trombone. 10. ""Sleepy Time Down South"" (1941). Armstrong's theme song, an irreplaceable example of his rich and resplendent lyricism.

Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life,,"['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Zen', 'Audiobook']","In the rush of modern life, we tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment. World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to ""mindfulness""—the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.Lucidly and beautifully written, Peace Is Every Step contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh's experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already is—in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part—and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of Peace Is Every Step encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the ""mindless"" into the mindFUL.",,,10/28/90,March 1st 1992,[],Paperback,,9780553351392,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320544155l/14572.jpg,4.31,[],291.0,4.0,,,,96.0,28778.0,160,Bantam,"['15046', '9115', '3533', '736', '348']",,[],,"['Thich Nhat Hanh', 'Arnold Kotler', 'Dalai Lama XIV']"

Panzram: A Journal of Murder,,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Crime', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Dark']","""In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and last but not least I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all of these things I am not the least bit sorry. I have no conscience so that does not worry me. I don't believe in man, God nor Devil. I hate the whole damn human race including myself.""Carl Panzram, who called himself the ""world's worst murderer,"" wrote these words in a full autobiography and confession he prepared for the one friend in his life-a young prison guard named Henry Lesser. PANZRAM: A JOURNAL OF MURDER, combines these brutally forthright memoirs with the commentary of authors Gaddis and Long, into a compelling chronicle of the forces that engender hate. The authors provide a historical and sociological framework for Panzram's own words, using this uniquely detailed self-analysis by a mass murderer to depict what happens when an intelligent and unbreakable personality that has been interminably and unmercifully abused strikes back in vengeance.  PANZRAM arrives as a gripping warning from America's recent past to our newly repressive era of prison-industrial complex, death penalty abuse, and unprecedentedly high rates of incarceration from a man who walked the halls of Death Row with a blindingly clear vision.

No embalo das ondas não pensava na sua agenda totalmente preenchida, nas inúmeras solicitações que tinha enquanto mulher de um sucedido empresário da comunicação social e directora de uma recente aquisição do marido, o diário ´O Popular´.

Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely Prisoners of Geography, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography?

Years before the defection of a Soviet submarine will send him hurtling into confrontation with the Soviets, historian, ex-Marine and CIA analyst Jack Ryan is vacationing in London with his wife and young daughter, when a terrorist attack takes place before his eyes. Instinctively, he dives forward to break it up, and is shot. It is not until he wakes up in the hospital that he learns whose lives he has saved -- the Prince and Princess of Wales and their new young son -- and which enemies he has made -- the Ulster Liberation Army, an ultra-left-wing splinter of the IRA.By his impulsive act, he has gained both the gratitude of a nation and then enmity of hits most dangerous men -- men who do not sit on their hate. And in the weeks and months to come, it is Jack Ryan, and his family, who will become the targets of that hate.",Jack Ryan #1,,08/04/87,May 1st 1992,"['The Prince of Wales', 'Dr. John ""Jack"" Patrick Ryan']",Paperback,,9780425134351,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328007145l/32682.jpg,4.13,[],743.0,12.0,,,,96.0,188100.0,503,Berkley,"['74828', '73209', '32668', '5212', '2183']",,"['London, England', 'Annapolis, Maryland (United States)']",,['Tom Clancy']

Philosophy For Dummies,,Philosophy,"Philosophy at its best is an activity more than a body of knowledge. In an ancient sense, done right, it is a healing art. It’s intellectual self-defense. It’s a form of therapy. But it’s also much more. Philosophy is map-making for the soul, cartography for the human journey. It’s an important navigational tool for life that too many modern people try to do without. Philosophy For Dummies is for anyone who has ever entertained a question about life and this world. In a conversational tone, the book's author – a modern-day scholar and lecturer – brings the greatest wisdom of the past into the challenges that we face now. This refreshingly different guide explains philosophical fundamentals and explores some of the strangest and deepest questions ever posed to human beings, such as How do we know anything? What does the word good mean? Are we ever really free? Do human beings have souls? Is there life after death? Is there a God? Is happiness really possible in our world? This book is chock full of all those questions you may have long wanted to think about and talk with someone about, but have never had the time or opportunity to tackle head on. Philosophy For Dummies invites you to discuss the issues you find in the guide, share perspectives, and compare thoughts and feelings with someone you respect. You'll find lots of material to mull over with your friends or spouse, including thoughts on When to doubt, and when to doubt our doubts The universal demand for evidence and proof The four dimensions of human experience Arguments for materialism Fear of the process of dying Prayers and small miracles Moral justification for allowing evil The ancient philosopher Socrates (fifth century, B.C.) thought that, when it comes to the Ultimate Questions, we all start off as dummies. But if we are humbly aware of how little we actually know, then we can really begin to learn.

And it is upon these women in flight from death and despair that nine male citizens of Ruby will lay their pain, their terror, and their murderous rage.In prose that soars with the rhythms, grandeur, and tragic arc of an epic poem, Toni Morrison challenges our most fiercely held beliefs as she weaves folklore and history, memory and myth into an unforgettable meditation of race, religion, gender, and a far-off past that is ever present.",,First Plume Printing (Oprah's Book Club),12/24/97,April 1st 1999,[],Paperback,,9780452280397,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558921210l/5198.jpg,3.81,"['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Shortlist (1999)', 'Ohioana Book Award for Fiction (1999)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (2000)']",269.0,3.0,,,,90.0,23040.0,318,Plume (Penguin Books Ltd),"['6888', '8101', '5685', '1613', '753']",,[],,['Toni Morrison']

Then he becomes fitted with superhuman, nanotronic, eyes for free, but there is a catch.. They are inherently intelligent and can develop various functions to assist in whatever awkward situations he experiences. In payment for the eyes, he is recruited into a secret government agency as an apprehensive assistant to an experienced agent and embarks on a series of adventures, including being abducted twice by an international gang of terrorists. Their leader, Rudolph Beckman, is a billionaire financier who is after the secrets of the laboratory that developed the nanotronic eyes. He uses a trio of henchmen to do his bidding.Each risky situation Horace encounters causes his eyes to develop something new, and enables his introvert personality to evolve too.

Phantoms in the Brain,Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind,Medical,"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases: A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial. A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious experience? A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.

Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind,,"['Science', 'Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Brain', 'Medical', 'Biology', 'Philosophy', 'Popular Science']","Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases:A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial.A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious experience?A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time.Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the ""big questions"" about consciousness and the self.",,,08/19/98,August 18th 1999,[],Paperback,,9780688172176,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409601908l/31555.jpg,4.26,[],90.0,1.0,,,,95.0,16908.0,352,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['8400', '5502', '2233', '525', '248']",,[],,"['V.

Recheado de flash-backs para o passado e para o futuro (!), a antevisão, real e com todos os detalhes, da degradação da sua velhice e do seu funeral urge em Paulo a derradeira tentativa de procura da explicação de um sentido para a vida, alimentada por muitos sonhos e esperanças no tempo em que tal era devido, cheia de frustrações e desilusões posteriores frutos de um destino azarado e de uma fatalidade previsível, condições propícias para um redescobrir da vida nos elementos mais simples que anteriormente passavam despercebidos na azáfama do cumprimento do quotidiano e de toda uma vida alicerçada nos seus valores supostamente mais altos.Nesta narrativa de evocações aleatórias, centrada no romance de Paulo com Sandra, mulher difícil e de poucos sentimentalismos, a redução de uma vida ao seu cumprimento basilar pelo amor, último alicerce num mundo de ilusões, revelando-se semítico na sua realização, e defraudado ainda por uma filha que o confronta com a esterilidade da sua actividade e do seu pensamento, mumificando-o no seu tempo presente, tempo esse prometedor de progressos civilizacionais que os próprios contemporâneos se encarregam de deitar a perder, ébrios de uma liberdade utópica que nada concilia face à disparidade de vertentes, facções e pontos de vista que num ruído ensurdecedor emudece e paralisa a humanidade no êxtase do extremo da civilização actual.Vítima do seu próprio pensamento perscrutador, questionando a sua condição humana e a dos outros, comparando-a até ao fim dos tempos, um lamento arrastado mas pontuado por algumas fagulhas de lucidez e outras de felicidade passada e presente, num acomodar inconsciente contrastante de uma luta ávida pela vida onde persistem ainda mais perguntas que respostas apesar de toda a sofreguidão de viver tal como evidenciado pelo relato de vida do narrador.

Physics and Psychics,,['Science'],"The astonishing discoveries made by modern physics - imploding black holes, ghost-like quarks, and the odd rules governing quantum mechanics - have transformed our image of the physical world. A growing number of writers assert that such discoveries also demonstrate the existence of a nonphysical, spiritual world, a world that permits a wide variety of paranormal and psychic phenomena.What exactly has physics shown us? Is there a world that transcends the sphere of the senses? Millions throughout history have thought so, but the existence of such a world is still accepted on faith alone. The tools of science have revealed no proof of spirits, ghosts, or supernatural phenomena.Physics and Psychics critically examines theories of a transcendent reality in terms of all that is currently known about matter at its most fundamental level. Victor J. Stenger gives a provocative, often amusing history of psychic research and occult beliefs, offering a convincing rebuttal to those who attempt to link physics to mystical truths. Stenger examines a number of well-known paranormal claims and shows how they can be explained without resorting to supernatural or psychic hypotheses. Discussing quantum theory and relativity, he demonstrates that these concepts actually invalidate paranormal claims and that there is no scientific basis for a universe other than one composed of observable matter.The human species has always lived under the assumption that supernatural forces determine destiny. Can our lives retain meaning when this assumption seems unfounded? Writes Stenger: ""The supernatural has been a yoke on the neck of humanity since we first began to think and dream. The tools of science provide the wherewithal to be guided not by 'a world beyond the senses' but by the power of the intellect; hence, they have given us 'freedom to live and act according to the fullest knowledge about the world'."" Stenger's vivid depiction of physics research provides a fitting culmination to this powerful book.",,,1990,,[],Kindle Edition,,9780879755751,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387752227l/8963238.jpg,3.94,[],45.0,1.0,,,,84.0,32.0,323,,"['14', '10', '3', '2', '3']",,[],,['Victor J.

It was a bizarre act of extreme violence that called for extreme measures on the part of elite counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp and his trusted team member, Mike Nash. Now that the initial shock of the catastrophe is over, key Washington officials are up in arms over whether to make friends or foes of the agents who stepped between the enemy's bullets and countless American lives regardless of the legal consequences. Not for the first time, Rapp finds himself in the frustrating position of having to illustrate the realities of national security to politicians whose view from the sidelines is inevitably obstructed.Meanwhile, three of the al Qaeda terrorists are still at large, and Rapp has been unofficially ordered to find them by any means necessary. No one knows the personal, physical, and emotional sacrifices required of the job better than Rapp. When he sees Nash cracking under the pressure of the mission and the memories of the horrors he witnessed during the terrorist attack, he makes a call he hopes will save his friend, assuage the naysayers on Capitol Hill, and get him one step closer to the enemy before it's too late.

It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist's inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane, one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the ""proto-element"" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art. As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",,,01/05/26,September 1st 1979,[],Paperback,,9780486238081,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408469531l/352807.jpg,3.93,[],75.0,1.0,,,,92.0,1053.0,192,Dover Publications,"['347', '386', '234', '67', '19']",,[],,"['Wassily Kandinsky', 'Hilla Rebay']"
Politics - According to the Bible: A Comprehensive Resource for Understanding Modern Political Issues in Light of Scripture,,"['Politics', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'Religion', 'Reference', 'Political Science', 'Philosophy']","A variety of perspectives exist within the Christian community when it comes to political issues and political involvement. This comprehensive and readable book presents a political philosophy from the perspective that the Gospel pertains to all of life so Christians should be involved in political issues. In brief, this is an analysis of conservative and liberal plans to do good for the nation, evaluated in light of the Bible and common sense.In this ground-breaking book, recognized evangelical Bible professor Wayne Grudem rejects five mistaken views about Christian influence on politics: (1) “compel religion,” (2) “exclude religion,” (3) “all government is demonic,” (4) “do evangel-ism, not politics,” and (5) “do politics, not evangelism.” He proposes a better alternative: (6) “significant Christian influence on government.” Then he explains the Bible’s teachings about the purpose of civil government and the characteristics of good or bad government. Does the Bible support some form of democracy? Should judges and the courts hold the ultimate power in a nation? With respect to specific political issues, Grudem argues that most people’s political views depend on deep-seated assumptions about several basic moral and even theological questions, such as whether God exists, whether absolute moral standards can be known, whether there is good and evil in each person’s heart, whether people should be accountable for their good and bad choices, whether property should belong to individuals or to society, and whether the purpose of the earth’s resources is to bring benefit to mankind. After addressing these foundational questions, Grudem provides a thoughtful, carefully-reasoned analysis of over fifty specific issues dealing with the protection of life, marriage, the family and children, economic issues and taxation, the environment, national defense, relationships to other nations, freedom of speech and religion, quotas, and special interests. He makes frequent application to the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, but the principles discussed here are relevant for any nation.",,,09/03/10,September 8th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780310330295,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347313034l/8982042.jpg,3.87,[],100.0,1.0,,,,87.0,433.0,624,Zondervan Academic,"['158', '138', '79', '37', '21']",,[],,['Wayne Grudem']
Politics Out of History,,"['Theory', 'History', 'Politics', 'Philosophy']","What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective? Politics Out of History is animated by the question of how we navigate the contemporary political landscape when the traditional compass points of modernity have all but disappeared. Wendy Brown diagnoses a range of contemporary political tendencies--from moralistic high-handedness to low-lying political despair in politics, from the difficulty of formulating political alternatives to reproaches against theory in intellectual life--as the consequence of this disorientation.Politics Out of History also presents a provocative argument for a new approach to thinking about history--one that forsakes the idea that history has a purpose and treats it instead as a way of illuminating openings in the present by, for example, identifying the haunting and constraining effects of past injustices unresolved. Brown also argues for a revitalized relationship between intellectual and political life, one that cultivates the autonomy of each while promoting their interlocutory potential. This book will be essential reading for all who find the trajectories of contemporary liberal democracies bewildering and are willing to engage readings of a range of thinkers--Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin, Derrida--to rethink democratic possibility in our time.",,,08/06/01,August 26th 2001,[],Paperback,,9780691070858,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347431373l/311909.jpg,4.13,[],97.0,1.0,,,,100.0,55.0,193,Princeton University Press,"['16', '30', '9', '0', '0']",,[],,['Wendy Brown']

While recuperating from wartime Warsaw in the Polish countryside, the unnamed narrator and his friend, Fryderyk, attempt to force amour between two local youths, Karol and Henia, as a kind of a lewd entertainment. They become increasingly frustrated as they discover that the two have no interest in one another, and the games are momentarily stopped by a local murder and a directive to assassinate a rogue member of the Polish resistance. Gombrowicz connects these threads magnificently in a tense climax that imbues his novel with a deep sense of the absurd and multiplies its complexity. Gombrowicz is a relentless psychoanalyzer and a consummate stylist; his prose is precise and forceful, and the narrator's strained attempts to elucidate why he takes such pleasure at soiling youth creepily evoke authentic pride and disgust. Borchardt's translation (the first into English from the original Polish) is a model of consistency, maintaining a manic tone as it navigates between lengthy, comma-spliced sentences and sharp, declarative thrusts. - Publishers Weekly",,,10/29/60,November 1994,[],Paperback,,9780714529882,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365031913l/475965.jpg,3.93,[],221.0,3.0,,,,93.0,2553.0,176,Marion Boyars Publishers Ltd,"['773', '1046', '552', '139', '43']",,[],,"['Witold Gombrowicz', 'Alastair Hamilton']"

An expert in the use of 'psychotherapy devices' that trap a patient's dreams and display them on a monitor, Atsuko is able to manipulate those dreams, even enter them, as an aid to psychoanalysis. When treating private patients, Atsuko transforms herself into the guise of Paprika - a captivating girl of unknown age - to mask her true identity.As Paprika delves ever deeper into her realm of fantasy, the borderline between dream and reality becomes increasingly blurred. All the more so when a colleague at the Institute develops a new device that allows the dreams of several individuals to be combined simultaneously. With this, they enter dangerous territory - far from curing their patients, they could drive them insane.

Paradigm Shift: How proper organization and preparation are the back-bones of any trading success (Trading Easyread Series Book 1),,[],"We all want consistent trading results, but how many of us have actually prepared for this? Trading is a highly competitive field and a very challenging endeavor where the learning curve is known to be very steep. The very nature of financial markets makes them uncertain and almost impossible to predict on a trade by trade basis. Hence, people who like to use their intellect to predict the markets are the ones who typically don't make it as consistently profitable traders. People who need to have that kind of certainty - not acting until they know what will happen next - are the ones who experience the most frustration because they are expecting something that the markets just cannot provide. And, in today's markets we are required more than ever to adapt and evolve in a manner that is quick and concise, if we want to acquire even the slightest edge. The Trading Easyread series targets the new generation of online traders who have an unquenchable desire to profit from the markets and who are willing to do the work necessary to achieve that goal. This book was written by a professional trader for beginning and intermediate level traders. Professionals will also find value in it as it can help them refresh their already acquired skills. The irony of all this is that, when your paradigm shifts - when you acquire a ‘trader’s mindset’ and, can remain confident in the face of constant uncertainty - trading will be as easy and as simple as you probably thought it was when you first started out. It is my hope is that the material presented in this book will bring you one step closer to that ideal mindset.",,,,July 12th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,B00LRYXMTO,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427495420l/25232065.jpg,4.3,[],100.0,1.0,,,,94.0,33.0,88,,"['19', '8', '4', '1', '1']",,[],,['Yvan Byeajee']

Poonachi: Or the Story of a Black Goat,,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Indian Literature', 'Animals', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Fantasy', 'Novella', 'Adult Fiction']","Through a seeming act of providence, an old couple receives a day-old female goat kid as a gift from the cosmos. Thus begins the story of Poonachi, the little orphan goat. As you follow her story from forest to habitation, independence to motherhood, you recognise in its significant moments the depth and magnitude of your own fears and longings, fuelled by the instinct for survival that animates all life. Masterly and nuanced, Perumal Murugan’s tale forces us reflect on our own responses to hierarchy and ownership, selflessness and appetite, love and desire, living and dying. Poonachi is the story of a goat who carries the burden of being different all her life, of a she-goat who survives against the odds. It is equally an expression of solidarity with the animal world and the female condition. The tale is also a commentary on our times, on the choices we make as a society and a nation, and the increasing vulnerability of individuals, particularly writers and artists, who resist when they are pressed to submit.
