P.K. Ojong,Perang Eropa Jilid II,,Indonesian,,"Mengapa sejarah menjadi penting? Alasan utamanya adalah karena dengan memahami sejarah segala hal yang ada sekarang menjadi make sense. Ya! Sejarah sedikit banyak membuat kita mengerti akan segala hal yang ada sekarang. Dengan memahami sejarah kita bisa menjadi maklum atau setidaknya mengerti mengapa Amerika menjadi pusat ilmu pengetahuan dan universitasnya menjadi acuan dunia saat ini atau kita juga jadi mengerti mengapa berbagai peperangan di masa lalu dimulai oleh negara-negara tertentu di sekitar asia tengah dan juga berbagai hal lainnya. Namun tentu saja buku perang eropa jilid II ini tidak bisa menjawab semua rasa ingin tahu kita. Tapi setidaknya buku ini cukup membuka wawasan kita akan beberapa hal.Buku ini adalah kelanjutan dari Perang Eropa Jilid I. Jika pada jilid I digambarkan terutama tentang kedigdayaan Jerman di medan perang sehingga bisa menguasai daratan Eropa dan afrika bagian utara (nyaris saja termasuk Uni Sovyet) tanpa ada perlawanan yang berarti dari negara yang diinvasinya, maka jilid II ini menggambarkan sebaliknya. Sekutu strikes back! Mungkin ini kalimat yang tepat menggambarkan keseluruhan buku ini.Walaupun dalam jilid I sudah mulai digambarkan sedikit pada bagian akhir buku itu tentang sekutu yang mulai unggul di kawasan afrika utara, jilid II ini menggambarkan lebih banyak lagi keunggulan sekutu di medan perang. Penggambaran keunggulan itu terutama penguasaan itali hingga hingga penyerbuan oleh angkatan udara sekutu ke pabrik penyulingan minyak di rumania juga penyerangan ke beberapa kota di jerman.Selain itu juga, digambarkan peranan para pejuang-pejuang bawah tanah di negara-negara dataran eropa yang berusaha mengusir pasukan jerman dari tanah airnya. Sehingga muncul nama-nama pemimpin pemberontakan itu seperti joseph broz tito di yugoslavia, odette di perancis, odd starheim di norwegia, dan beberapa orang di polandia.Unuk masalah teknologi perang, digambarkan juga beberapa teknologi dan persenjataan yang digunakan selama perang. Terakhir, yang juga ditonjolkan dalam buku ini adalah hubugan antara inggris dan amerika yang tergabung dalam sekutu. Digambarkan bagaimana perbedaan pemikiran diantaranya keduanya dan juga kerjasama yang dilakukan.",Perang Eropa,,,2004,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Indonesian Literature']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1224860150l/1387654.jpg,4.21,[],73.0,1.0,,1387654.Perang_Eropa_Jilid_II,,,,,97.0,337.0,410,,Penerbit Buku Kompas,"['155', '113', '58', '7', '4']",,,[],,

Sitting in his office on a warm spring day, he receives an unexpected visit from an Amish man who claims his brother, a dwarf like himself, has been murdered. Their discussion of the odd details of the case is interrupted by a commotion on campus, which turns out to be the apparent suicide of a young woman, who, it seems, has leapt to her death from the college bell tower.The investigations of these two deaths become intertwined as Professor Branden again teams up with his colleagues Pastor Cal Troyer and Sheriff Bruce Robertson to seek explanations for these bizarre events.Separate from the World is a story of a rift between two Amish factions, one that favors the use of medicine and that participates in a college study of genetic traits particular to the Amish community, and the other that rejects any outside influence.Once more, P.

Soon a mysterious trio arrives to take him away: the explorer Umber, the shy archer Sophie, and Oates, whose strength and honesty are both brutal. Hap and his new acquaintances narrowly escape the cavernous underworld and make their way to Lord Umber's bustling jewel of a harbor city, Kurahaven.  Once there, Hap learns that Lord Umber is an extraordinary man -- he's a merchant, adventurer, inventor, royal adviser, and chronicler of all things monstrous and magical. But Umber's accomplishments can't answer the question closest to the boy's heart: Who is Happenstance?  Desperate to uncover clues in his new, baffling surroundings, Hap accompanies Umber on dangerous and unusual missions. But Hap soon learns that there are powerful enemies inside the kingdom, and a ruthless assassin is hot on his trail.

P.W. Singer (Goodreads Author),Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry,,English,,"Some have claimed that'War is too important to be left to the generals, 'but P. W. Singer asks'What about the business executives?'Breaking out of the guns-for-hire mold of traditional mercenaries, corporations now sell skills and services that until recently only state militaries possessed. Their products range from trained commando teams to strategic advice from generals.This new'Privatized Military Industry'encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue. Whether as proxies or suppliers, such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. More recently, they have become a key element in U.S. military operations. Private corporations working for profit now sway the course of national and international conflict, but the consequences have been little explored.In this book, Singer provides the first account of the military services industry and its broader implications. Corporate Warriors includes a description of how the business works, as well as portraits of each of the basic types of companies: military providers that offer troops for tactical operations; military consultants that supply expert advice and training; and military support companies that sell logistics, intelligence, and engineering.The privatization of warfare allows startling new capabilities and efficiencies in the ways that war is carried out.

Composed of 316 unanswerable questions, these poems integrate the wonder of a child with the experiences of an adult. By turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant, Neruda's questions lead the reader beyond reason into the realms of intuition and pure imagination.This complete translation of Pablo Neruda's El libro de las preguntas (The Book of Questions) features Neruda's original Spanish-language poems alongside William O'Daly's English translations. In his introduction O'Daly, who has translated eight volumes of Pablo Neruda's poetry, writes, ""These poems, more so than any of Neruda's other work, remind us that living in a state of visionary surrender to the elemental questions, free of the quiet desperation of clinging too tightly to answers, may be our greatest act of faith.""When Neruda died in 1973, The Book of Questions was one of eight unpublished poetry manuscripts that lay on his desk. In it, Neruda achieves a deeper vulnerability and vision than in his earlier work-and this unique book is a testament to everything that made Neruda an artist.""Neruda's questions evoke pictures that make sense on a visual level before the reader can grasp them on a literal one.

Más allá de toda parafernalia, retorna. Casi treinta años después de su muerte, su imagen cruza generaciones, su mito persigue los delirios de grandeza del neoliberalismo. Irreverente, burlón, terco —moralmente terco—, el Che siempre será motivo de debate.Con abundante material hasta ahora inédito —fotos, testimonios, diarios…—, Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che es una biografía minuciosa y detallada que nos revela a un personaje diferente del que creemos conocer; un hombre que, siendo ministro de Industria en Cuba, jamás terminaba de amarrarse las botas.

Allí, aprende a convivir con sus nuevos compañeros –cada uno con un cuadro “clínico” y un carácter bien distintos– y los cuidadores que les atienden. Emilio se adentra en una rutina diaria de cadencia morosa con horarios prefijados –la toma de los medicamentos, la siesta, las comidas, la gimnasia, la vuelta a la cama…– y en su pulso con la enfermedad para intentar mantener la memoria y evitar ser trasladado a la última planta, la de los impedidos, cuenta con la ayuda de Ernesto, su compañero de habitación…Paco Roca aborda en Arrugas temas delicados, hasta ahora escasamente tratados en historieta, como son el Alzheimer y la demencia senil.

Paco Underhill,Call of the Mall,How We Shop,,Consumer behavior,"Like Underhill's bestseller, Why We Buy, this is a pleasurable and informative book on how we shop that surprises and tickles. Like Bill Bryson's Walk in the Woods, which took readers up the Appalachian Trail, this book takes readers to a place they know much better: the shopping centre, the place where people meet. Nothing exemplifies shopping more than the mall or shopping centre. It is the US's gift to personal consumption and the crossroad where consumer marketing, media and street culture meet. It is where the developed world (and increasingly everyone else too) goes to acquire, eat and hang out. It is where fashion trends are made dreams are constructed, and many people find their first jobs. The Call of the Mall is about sex and buying lingerie, about why the same camel coat costs exactly twice as much in the women's department to the men's, about why all mall food is so dreadful when the commodities in the shops are so good. Why location matters so much - but more for perfumes than DIY and why malls are invariably such bad architecture.

Padma Viswanathan,The Toss of a Lemon,,English,,"In south India in 1896, ten-year old Sivakami is about to embark on a new life. Hanumarathnam, a village healer with some renown as an astrologer, has approached her parents with a marriage proposal. In keeping with custom, he provides his prospective in-laws with his horoscope. The problem is that his includes a prediction, albeit a weak one, that he will die in his tenth year of marriage. Despite the ominous horoscope, Sivakami’s parents hesitate only briefly, won over by the young man and his family’s reputation as good, upstanding Brahmins. Once married, Sivikami and Hanumarathnam grow to love one another and the bride, now in her teens, settles into a happy life. But the predictions of Hanumarathnam’s horoscope are never far from her new husband’s mind. When their first child is born, as a strategy for accurately determining his child’s astrological charts, Hanumarathnam insists the midwife toss a lemon from the window of the birthing room the moment his child appears. All is well with their first child, a daughter, Thangam, whose birth has a positive influence on her father’s astrological future. But this influence is fleeting: when a son, Vairum, is born, his horoscope confirms that his father will die within three years.Resigned to his fate, Hanumarathnam sets himself to the unpleasant task of readying his household for his imminent death. Knowing the hardships and social restrictions Sivakami will face as a Brahmin widow, he hires and trains a servant boy called Muchami to help Sivakami manage the household and properties until Vairum is of age.When Sivakami is eighteen, Hanumarathnam dies as predicted. Relentless in her adherence to the traditions that define her Brahmin caste, she shaves her head and dons the white sari of the widow. With some reluctance, she moves to her family home to raise her children under the protection of her brothers, but then realizes that they are not acting in the best interests of her children. With her daughter already married to an unreliable husband of her brothers’ choosing, and Vairum’s future also at risk, Sivakami leaves her brothers and returns to her marital home to raise her family.With the freedom to make decisions for her son’s future, Sivakami defies tradition and chooses to give him a secular education. While her choice ensures that Vairum fulfills his promise, it also sets Sivakami on a collision course with him. Vairum, fatherless in childhood, childless as an adult, rejects the caste identity that is his mother’s mainstay, twisting their fates in fascinating and unbearable ways.",,,,April 1st 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cultural', 'Historical', 'Family', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Asia', 'Womens']",,9780307356321,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320460885l/2694064.jpg,3.77,[],87.0,1.0,,2694064-the-toss-of-a-lemon,,,,,89.0,2912.0,640,,Random House Canada,"['758', '1140', '698', '232', '84']",,,['India'],,

A book of post-9/11 Canada, The Ever After of Ashwin Rao demonstrates that violent politics are all-too-often homegrown in North America but ignored at our peril. In 2004, almost 20 years after the fatal bombing of an Air India flight from Vancouver, 2 suspects--finally--are on trial for the crime. Ashwin Rao, an Indian psychologist trained in Canada, comes back to do a ""study of comparative grief,"" interviewing people who lost loved ones in the attack. What he neglects to mention is that he, too, had family members who died on the plane. Then, to his delight and fear, he becomes embroiled in the lives of one family caught in the undertow of the tragedy, and privy to their secrets.

  Tibetan Book of the Dead
, Robert Thurman's takes literally the entire gamut of metaphysical assumptions. The Bar do thos grol, or as Thurman translates, The Great Book of Natural Liberation through Understanding in the Between, is but one of many mortuary texts of Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism and is commonly recited to or by a person facing imminent death. Thurman reproduces it for this purpose, explaining in some depth the Tibetan conception of post-mortem existence. Over as many as 12 days, the deceased person is given explanations of what he or she sees and experiences and is guided through innumerable visions of the realms beyond to reach eventual liberation, or, failing that, a safe rebirth. Like a backpacker's guide to a foreign land, Thurman's version is clear, detailed, and sympathetic to the inexperienced voyager, including background and supplementary information, even illustrations (sorry, no maps).

Pamela Gien,The Syringa Tree,,English,,"In this heartrending and inspiring novel set against the gorgeous, vast landscape of South Africa under apartheid, award-winning playwright Pamela Gien tells the story of two families–one black, one white–separated by racism, connected by love. Even at the age of six, lively, inquisitive Elizabeth Grace senses she’s a child of privilege, “a lucky fish.” Soothing her worries by raiding the sugar box, she scampers up into the sheltering arms of the lilac-blooming syringa tree growing behind the family’ s suburban Johannesburg home.Lizzie’s closest ally and greatest love is her Xhosa nanny, Salamina. Deeper and more elemental than any traditional friendship, their fierce devotion to each other is charged and complicated by Lizzie’s mother, who suffers from creeping melancholy, by the stresses of her father’s medical practice, which is segregated by law, and by the violence, injustice, and intoxicating beauty of their country. In the social and racial upheavals of the 1960s, Lizzie’s eyes open to the terror and inhumanity that paralyze all the nation’s cultures–Xhosa, Zulu, Jew, English, Boer. Pass laws requiring blacks to carry permission papers for white areas and stringent curfews have briefly created an orderly state–but an anxious one. Yet Lizzie’s home harbors its own set of rules, with hushed midnight gatherings, clandestine transactions, and the girl’s special task of protecting Salamina’s newborn child–a secret that, because of the new rules, must never be mentioned outside the walls of the house.As the months pass, the contagious spirit of change sends those once underground into the streets to challenge the ruling authority. And when this unrest reaches a social and personal climax, the unthinkable will happen and forever change Lizzie’s view of the world. When The Syringa Tree opened off-Broadway in 2001, theater critics and audiences alike embraced the play, and it won many awards. Pamela Gien has superbly deepened the story in this new novel, giving a personal voice to the horrors and hopes of her homeland. Written with lyricism, passion, and life-affirming redemption, this compelling story shows the healing of the heart of a young woman and the soul of a sundered nation.",,,01/30/03,June 27th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Africa', 'South Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical', 'Novels']",,9780375507557,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388290325l/37474.jpg,3.77,[],97.0,1.0,,37474.The_Syringa_Tree,,,,,92.0,493.0,262,,Random House,"['112', '208', '133', '27', '13']",,,[],,

Pamela Kaufman,The Book of Eleanor: A Novel of Eleanor of Aquitaine,,English,,"One of history’s greatest women, celebrated by her contemporaries, descendants, and biographers, now comes to life in this mesmerizing new novel by bestselling author Pamela Kaufman.In 1137, fifteen-year-old Eleanor became Duchess of Aquitaine, a wealthy and powerful province in the south of France. Rich and influential in her own right, her tumultuous marriages thrust Eleanor into the political and cultural spotlight, where she would remain for more than half a century. Still in her teens, young Eleanor of Aquitaine married Louis VII of France, a sickly religious fanatic so obsessed with fears of adultery that he kept his beautiful wife under lock and key, even forcing her to go on a long and dangerous crusade with him. But Eleanor was delighted by the freedom of the crusader’s life. Her handsome Aquitanian knights, her deeds on horseback, and her scandalous attire were the talk of Europe; it soon became clear that Louis’s young wife was more than he could handle. A lifelong rebel, Eleanor would defy her husband and the Church, and eventually strong-arm the Pope into annulling her unhappy marriage.Once free of Louis, Eleanor thought to marry Baron Rancon, her childhood love, but found herself forced into another political marriage, this time with a younger and more dangerous husband—Henry II of England, a ruthless soldier known throughout Europe as “the red star of malice.” In Henry Eleanor found a man whose iron will and political cunning matched her own, but the marriage was a bitter and brutal one, which escalated into open warfare when Eleanor backed their sons in an armed rebellion against Henry. Vowing revenge, he imprisoned her for fifteen years, hoping she would die in obscurity. But Eleanor would not go quietly. In prison, she wrote her memoir; this is Eleanor’s book.",,,03/12/02,March 25th 2003,"['Eleanor of Aquitaine', 'Henry II of England', 'Louis VII of France']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'British Literature', 'Romance', 'France', '12th Century', 'Adult', 'Plantagenet']",,9780609808092,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320545997l/159297.jpg,3.78,[],50.0,1.0,,159297.The_Book_of_Eleanor,,,,,89.0,1400.0,560,,Broadway Books,"['386', '518', '346', '102', '48']",,,[],,

Pamela Samuels Young (Goodreads Author),Anybody's Daughter,,English,,"Based on the real-life horrors faced by thousands of girls, award-winning author Pamela Samuels Young takes readers deep inside the disturbing world of child sex trafficking in a fast-paced thriller that educates as much as it entertains. Thirteen-year-old Brianna Walker is ecstatic. She's about to sneak off to meet her first real boyfriend—a boyfriend she met on Facebook. But Brianna is in for a horrifying surprise because her boyfriend doesn't exist. Instead, Brianna unwittingly becomes the captive of a ring of drug dealers- turned-human traffickers who prey on lonely girls from dysfunctional homes. But they’ve made a big mistake in targeting Brianna because she doesn’t meet either of those criteria. Brianna’s Uncle Dre, a man with his own criminal past, is determined to find the niece who is more like a daughter to him. Rather than sit back and rely on police to bring Brianna home, Dre scours the dark corners of Los Angeles looking for her. He is stunned to learn that the trafficking of children isn’t just happening in other countries. It’s occurring at epidemic levels right in his own backyard. Dre is not alone in his desperate search. Loretha Johnson knows this world well. A social worker who previously lived “the life,” Loretha now dedicates her time to saving as many young girls as she can find. She turns out to be an invaluable resource for Dre, who ultimately gets a lead on The Shepherd, a mastermind in the trafficking world whose every move is fueled by ego and greed. Dre vows to bring his reign of terror to an end. While Brianna makes a futile effort to thwart her captors, Dre is getting closer and closer to finding her. The woman he loves, attorney Angela Evans, knows the dangers faced by sexually exploited children because she represents them in juvenile court.

Paola Predicatori,Il mio inverno a Zerolandia,,Italian,,"Alessandra ha diciassette anni quando la sua mamma muore dopo una lunga malattia. Rimasta sola con la nonna, torna a scuola decisa a respingere le attenzioni dei compagni che sente estranei, impegnata com'è nella manutenzione del suo dolore. Per questo cambia banco e prende posto vicino a Gabriele detto Zero, la nullità della classe: desidera solo essere ignorata dagli altri, come succede a lui. Ma Zero è più interessante di quanto sembra. Ha una gran passione e un vero talento per il disegno; nella sua apparente noncuranza è attento e sensibile; è lui a soccorrere Ale sbucando inaspettato al suo fianco quando lei ha bisogno di aiuto. Piano piano un sentimento indefinibile prende forma tra le pareti della classe e la spiaggia d'inverno, grigi fondali di una storia semplice e complicata insieme: perché Alessandra è tanto lucida nel rivisitare il ricordo della madre quanto confusa nel prendere le misure di se stessa e di ciò che prova. E Gabriele è abilissimo a sparire proprio quando lei scopre di volerlo vicino. E la voce di Ale, ruvida nel dare conto del presente, dolcissima nell'evocare il passato, a raccontarci la storia di una perdita, una storia di scuola, una goffa, incerta storia d'amore.

Paolo Giordano,Il nero e l'argento,,Italian,,"Questa è la storia di un amore giovane. Di una coppia felice e inesperta, spaventata di scoprire, giorno dopo giorno, le molteplici forme dell’abbandono. Perché anche le famiglie possono soffrire di solitudine, proprio come le persone. Ad accudire in silenzio tutte le incertezze, oltre a prendersi cura del loro bambino, ci ha sempre pensato la signora A. Per questo, quando arriva un male a portarsela via, si spalanca in casa un vuoto improvviso. Nora e suo marito devono ancora accorgersi che il coraggio della signora A., ormai, appartiene anche a loro.È dentro le stanze che le famiglie crescono: strepitanti, incerte, allegre, spaventate. Giovani coppie alle prime armi, pronte ad abbracciarsi o a perdersi. Come Nora e suo marito. Ma di quelle stanze bisogna prima o poi spalancare porte e finestre, aprirsi al tempo che passa, all’aria di fuori. «A lungo andare ogni amore ha bisogno di qualcuno che lo veda e riconosca, che lo avvalori, altrimenti rischia di essere scambiato per un malinteso». È cosí che la signora A., nell'attimo stesso in cui entra in casa per occuparsi delle faccende domestiche, diventa la custode di una relazione, la bussola per orientarsi nella bonaccia e nella burrasca. Con le pantofole allineate accanto alla porta e gli scontrini esatti al centesimo, l’appropriazione indebita della cucina e i pochi tesori di una sua vita segreta, appare fin da subito solida, testarda, magica, incrollabile. «La signora A. era la sola vera testimone dell’impresa che compivamo giorno dopo giorno, la sola testimone del legame che ci univa. Senza il suo sguardo ci sentivamo in pericolo». Ci sono molti modi per raccontare una storia d’amore. Paolo Giordano ha scelto la via piú sensibile: registrare come un sismografo le scosse del quotidiano, gli slanci e i dolori, l’incapacità e il desiderio.

When Alice and Mattia meet as teenagers, they recognize in each other a kindred, damaged spirit.

Paramahansa Yogananda,Autobiography of a Yogi,,English,,"This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda narrates the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounters with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. Autobiography of a Yogi is at once a beautifully written account of an exceptional life and a profound introduction to the ancient science of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story thus becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence.

And someone is willing to kill Val for it.Val and Fang have to find the powerful Encyclopedia Magicka before either of San Antonio's warring underworld factions locate it or the consequences will be deadly for the entire city.

Huntington comes an enemies-to-lovers, slow-burn romance full of revenge and a dash of fate.  “She could enjoy her pretty, perfect world a little longer. Soon enough, everything she owned would be mine.”  I had a plan to escape the friend zone. Step one: sneak into Reed’s room. Step two: sleep with him.  But when the lights turned on, it wasn’t familiar blue eyes I saw. These were dark, angry, and full of demons. And they belonged to Reed’s much older brother.

At thirty-two, he’s a billionaire, in need of revenge.  Who cares if my family ruined his? Who cares if he looks at me with pure loathing? Who cares if every task he assigns me is designed to torture?  I need the money. Simple as that.  I’ll suffer his cruelty in silence, knowing there’s one thing he wants more than revenge… Me.

Raimund Gregorius is a Latin teacher at a Swiss college who one day—after a chance encounter with a mysterious Portuguese woman—abandons his old life to start a new one. He takes the night train to Lisbon and carries with him a book by Amadeu de Prado, a (fictional) Portuguese doctor and essayist whose writings explore the ideas of loneliness, mortality, death, friendship, love, and loyalty. Gregorius becomes obsessed by what he reads and restlessly struggles to comprehend the life of the author.

Pat Barker,Regeneration,,English,,"Regeneration, one in Pat Barker's series of novels confronting the psychological effects of World War I, focuses on treatment methods during the war and the story of a decorated English officer sent to a military hospital after publicly declaring he will no longer fight. Yet the novel is much more. Written in sparse prose that is shockingly clear—the descriptions of electronic treatments are particularly harrowing—it combines real-life characters and events with fictional ones in a work that examines the insanity of war like no other. Barker also weaves in issues of class and politics in this compactly powerful book.

Pat Barker,The Silence of the Girls,,English,,"The ancient city of Troy has withstood a decade under siege of the powerful Greek army, which continues to wage bloody war over a stolen woman—Helen. In the Greek camp, another woman—Briseis—watches and waits for the war's outcome. She was queen of one of Troy's neighboring kingdoms, until Achilles, Greece's greatest warrior, sacked her city and murdered her husband and brothers. Briseis becomes Achilles's concubine, a prize of battle, and must adjust quickly in order to survive a radically different life, as one of the many conquered women who serve the Greek army. When Agamemnon, the brutal political leader of the Greek forces, demands Briseis for himself, she finds herself caught between the two most powerful of the Greeks. Achilles refuses to fight in protest, and the Greeks begin to lose ground to their Trojan opponents. Keenly observant and coolly unflinching about the daily horrors of war, Briseis finds herself in an unprecedented position, able to observe the two men driving the Greek army in what will become their final confrontation, deciding the fate not only of Briseis's people but also of the ancient world at large.Briseis is just one among thousands of women living behind the scenes in this war—the slaves and prostitutes, the nurses, the women who lay out the dead—all of them erased by history. With breathtaking historical detail and luminous prose, Pat Barker brings the teeming world of the Greek camp to vivid life. She offers nuanced, complex portraits of characters and stories familiar from mythology, which, seen from Briseis's perspective, are rife with newfound revelations. Barker's latest builds on her decades-long study of war and its impact on individual lives—and it is nothing short of magnificent.",,,08/30/18,September 4th 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Retellings', 'Adult', 'Greek Mythology', 'War', 'Audiobook']",,9780385544214,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519448688l/37969723._SY475_.jpg,3.91,"['Costa Book Award Nominee for Novel (2018)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee (2019)""]",98.0,1.0,,37969723-the-silence-of-the-girls,,,,,93.0,36832.0,291,,Doubleday Books,"['10633', '15379', '8319', '1961', '540']",,,[],,

Pat Connid,50 Shades of Gray Matter #1,,English,,"Book 1 Excerpt Ultimately, I think it was the traffic that got to me. To be blunt, zombies can't drive.And, I live in Atlanta-- people here started off being really, really crappy drivers. And adding in the effects of ZBF [zombie bird flu]-- the blurred vision, inconsistent eye-hand coordination, and a cerebral cortex shriveled like Hitler's testicle on an Arctic expedition-- you've got a traffic jam that encircles the city, cuts through the city and clogs up most streets downtown. Yet, while it was the 24/7 bumper-to-bumper traffic that put me over the edge, I have to admit, it's really the globe-wide traffic jams-- with undead motorists honking, growling, and giving whatever fingers that might be left to other zombie motorists-- that have allowed the few remaining uninfected to avoid, so far, being summarily attacked and eaten. Many of them, the survivors, I understand, have gone to Canada. Think of how that must frustrate the Canadian tourism industry to no end! All those print ads and broadcast campaigns about skiing and fresh air and ""darn good fishing""? What a waste! Turns out, they had it all wrong.  Here's your big winner: ""Come to Canada. Zombies don't do winter."" So, then, what about those of us who are no longer pure human? We must ask ourselves, we who have begun ""the turn,"" What's our future like? Okay, there isn't one. That's the thought that led me to a local pharmacy-- drunk and infected, already starting to turn, and seeking enough painkillers to punch my ticket for the way out. I was nearly undead and wanted to die.  But, it didn't turn out that way.

Pat Conroy,South of Broad,,English,,"The one and only Pat Conroy returns, with a big, sprawling novel that is at once a love letter to Charleston and to lifelong friendship.Against the sumptuous backdrop of Charleston, South Carolina, South of Broad gathers a unique cast of sinners and saints. Leopold Bloom King, our narrator, is the son of an amiable, loving father who teaches science at the local high school. His mother, an ex-nun, is the high school principal and a well-known Joyce scholar. After Leo's older brother commits suicide at the age of thirteen, the family struggles with the shattering effects of his death, and Leo, lonely and isolated, searches for something to sustain him. Eventually, he finds his answer when he becomes part of a tightly knit group of high school seniors that includes friends Sheba and Trevor Poe, glamorous twins with an alcoholic mother and a prison-escapee father; hardscrabble mountain runaways Niles and Starla Whitehead; socialite Molly Huger and her boyfriend, Chadworth Rutledge X; and an ever-widening circle whose liaisons will ripple across two decades-from 1960s counterculture through the dawn of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. The ties among them endure for years, surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, and Charleston's dark legacy of racism and class divisions. But the final test of friendship that brings them to San Francisco is something no one is prepared for. South of Broad is Pat Conroy at his finest; a long-awaited work from a great American writer whose passion for life and language knows no bounds.",,,,August 11th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Southern', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Audiobook', 'Coming Of Age', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Book Club']",,9780385413053,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320532445l/6135237.jpg,3.82,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2009)'],488.0,6.0,,6135237-south-of-broad,,,,,89.0,40363.0,514,,Nan A.

Pat Conroy,My Losing Season: A Memoir,,English,,"“I was born to be a point guard, but not a very good one. . . .There was a time in my life when I walked through the world known to myself and others as an athlete. It was part of my own definition of who I was and certainly the part I most respected. When I was a young man, I was well-built and agile and ready for the rough and tumble of games, and athletics provided the single outlet for a repressed and preternaturally shy boy to express himself in public....I lost myself in the beauty of sport and made my family proud while passing through the silent eye of the storm that was my childhood.”  So begins Pat Conroy’s journey back to 1967 and his startling realization “that this season had been seminal and easily the most consequential of my life.” The place is the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, that now famous military college, and in memory Conroy gathers around him his team to relive their few triumphs and humiliating defeats. In a narrative that moves seamlessly between the action of the season and flashbacks into his childhood, we see the author’s love of basketball and how crucial the role of athlete is to all these young men who are struggling to find their own identity and their place in the world.In fast-paced exhilarating games, readers will laugh in delight and cry in disappointment. But as the story continues, we gradually see the self-professed “mediocre” athlete merge into the point guard whose spirit drives the team. He rallies them to play their best while closing off the shouts of “Don’t shoot, Conroy” that come from the coach on the sidelines. For Coach Mel Thompson is to Conroy the undermining presence that his father had been throughout his childhood. And in these pages finally, heartbreakingly, we learn the truth about the Great Santini.In My Losing Season Pat Conroy has written an American classic about young men and the bonds they form, about losing and the lessons it imparts, about finding one’s voice and one’s self in the midst of defeat. And in his trademark language, we see the young Conroy walk from his life as an athlete to the writer the world knows him to be.",,,10/15/02,August 26th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Sports', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Basketball', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Southern', 'Adult', 'Coming Of Age']",,9780553381900,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578751l/119216.jpg,3.9,['ALA Alex Award (2003)'],309.0,5.0,,119216.My_Losing_Season,,,,,93.0,8371.0,432,,Dial Press Trade Paperback,"['2537', '3145', '2103', '461', '125']",,,[],,

Pat Conroy,My Reading Life,,English,,"Bestselling author Pat Conroy acknowledges the books that have shaped him and celebrates the profound effect reading has had on his life. Pat Conroy, the beloved American storyteller, is a voracious reader. Starting as a childhood passion that bloomed into a life-long companion, reading has been Conroy’s portal to the world, both to the farthest corners of the globe and to the deepest chambers of the human soul. His interests range widely, from Milton to Tolkien, Philip Roth to Thucydides, encompassing poetry, history, philosophy, and any mesmerizing tale of his native South. He has for years kept notebooks in which he records words and expressions, over time creating a vast reservoir of playful turns of phrase, dazzling flashes of description, and snippets of delightful sound, all just for his love of language. But for Conroy reading is not simply a pleasure to be enjoyed in off-hours or a source of inspiration for his own writing. It would hardly be an exaggeration to claim that reading has saved his life, and if not his life then surely his sanity.  In My Reading Life, Conroy revisits a life of reading through an array of wonderful and often surprising anecdotes: sharing the pleasures of the local library’s vast cache with his mother when he was a boy, recounting his decades-long relationship with the English teacher who pointed him onto the path of letters, and describing a profoundly influential period he spent  in Paris, as well as reflecting on other pivotal people, places, and experiences. His story is a moving and personal one, girded by wisdom and an undeniable honesty.

Arbus herself remained an enigma until the publication of this first full biography. Patricia Bosworth examines the life behind the eerie, mesmerizing photographs: Diane's pampered childhood; her passionate marriage to Allan Arbus and their work together as fashion photographers during the fifties; the emotional upheaval surrounding the end of that marriage; and the radically dark, liberating, and ultimately tragic turn Diane's art took during the sixties.

Patricia Brady,A Being So Gentle: The Frontier Love Story of Rachel and Andrew Jackson,,English,,"
  The forty-year love affair between Rachel and Andrew Jackson parallels a tumultuous period in American history. Andrew Jackson was at the forefront of the American revolution—but he never could have made it without the support of his wife. Beautiful, charismatic, and generous, Rachel Jackson had the courage to go against the mores of her times in the name of love. As the wife of a great general in wartime, she often found herself running their plantation alone and, a true heroine, she took in and raised children orphaned by the war. Like many great love stories, this one ends tragically when Rachel dies only a few weeks after Andrew is elected president. He moved into the White House alone and never remarried. Andrew and Rachel Jackson’s devotion to one another is inspiring, and here, in Patricia Brady’s vivid prose, their story of love and loss comes to life for the first time.

Patricia Briggs,Masques and Wolfsbane,,English,,"Before Patricia Briggs penned her bestselling Mercy Thompson series, she cut her authorial teeth on a medieval fantasy called Masques. In it we meet Aralorn, a shapeshifter who fled her noble existence for a life of adventure as a mercenary spy. A jewel in the rough, Masques promised a sequel that never saw the light of day...until now. Together with the newly revised and updated first novel, Wolfsbane weaves a sinuous story of romance, danger, mystery, and magic. Masques & Wolfsbane delivers the first two tales of the Sianim saga in one fast and fiercely fun volume. In Masques, Aralorn and her companion Wolf—a shapeshifter whose feral form hides a mysterious past—are sent to fight Geoffrey ae’Magi, a sorcerer with dangerous plans for Aralorn’s homeland...and all mankind. But can they defeat his illusory magic—a power so great it transforms men and monsters into vacuous slaves?

Patricia Cornwell,The Scarpetta Collection Volume II,All That Remains and Cruel & Unusual,,Fiction,"International publishing sensation Patricia Cornwell's legion of readers will welcome this omnibus edition of her third and fourth megabestselling Kay Scarpetta novels, All That Remains and Cruel & Unusual. These two novels, presented here complete and unabridged, helped to confirm Patricia Cornwell's status as queen of the forensic thriller and one of the world's top bestselling authors. All That Remains A killer is stalking young lovers. Taking their lives and leaving just a tantalizing clue. When the bodies of young couples start turning up in remote woodland areas, Dr. Kay Scarpetta's task as Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner is made more difficult by the effects of the elements. Eight times she must write that the cause of death is undetermined. But when the latest young woman to go missing is the daughter of one of America's most powerful women, Kay also finds herself prey to political pressure and press harassment. The killings must stop. Now. Scarpetta soon discovers that someone is withholding vital evidence, or even faking it. Meanwhile, a cunning sadistic killer is still at large. Cruel & Unusual At 11:05 one December evening in Richmond, Virginia, convicted murderer Ronnie Joe Waddell is pronounced dead in the electric chair. At the morgue, Dr. Kay Scarpetta has been waiting for Waddell's body. Preparing to perform a postmortem before the subject is dead is a strange feeling for Scarpetta, but she has been here before. And Waddell's death is not the only newsworthy event on this freezing night: the grotesquely wounded body of a young boy is found propped against a garbage Dumpster. To Scarpetta, the two cases seem unrelated, until she recalls that the body of Waddell's victim had been arranged in a strikingly similar position. Was Waddell innocent? Is someone else out there, who may attack again?",,,,2003.0,,,,074325581X,9780743255813,,,4.15,,,,,,,,,,,,672.0,,,,29.0,,,,
Patricia Cornwell (Goodreads Author),Depraved Heart,,English,,"Dr. Kay Scarpetta is working a highly suspicious death scene in a historic home in Cambridge, Massachusetts when an emergency alert sounds on her phone. A video link lands in her text messages, immediately begins playing... and seems to be from her niece Lucy. But how can it be? It’s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago.As Scarpetta watches she comes to grips with frightening secrets about her niece, whom she loves like a daughter. That first clip and others sent soon after raise dangerous implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, alarmed, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn’t know whom she can tell – not her FBI agent husband, Benton Wesley, or her investigative partner, Pete Marino. Not even Lucy.Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the bizarre death of a Hollywood mogul’s daughter, wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta’s entire world and everyone she loves. The diabolical presence and singularly ""depraved heart"" behind what unfolds seems obvious - but strangely, not to the FBI. Certainly that’s the message they send when they start harassing Lucy and begin building a case that could send her to prison for the rest of her life.In the latest novel in her bestselling series featuring medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell captivates readers again with the jolting twists, high-wire tension, and cutting-edge forensic detail for which she is renowned, proving yet again why she is the world’s number one bestselling crime writer.",Kay Scarpetta #23,,10/22/15,October 27th 2015,"['Kay Scarpetta', 'Benton Wesley', 'Pete Marino', 'Lucy Farinelli', 'Park Hyde', 'Amanda Gilbert', 'Bryce Clark', 'Luke Zenner']",Hardcover,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Drama', 'Murder Mystery']",,9780062325402,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439833245l/24903919.jpg,3.62,[],190.0,2.0,,24903919-depraved-heart,,,,,84.0,17569.0,466,,William Morrow,"['4581', '5421', '4754', '1959', '854']",,,[],,

Patricia Cornwell (Goodreads Author),Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed,,English,,"Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus.In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror.  An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End.  Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim.  And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun.  He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene.  Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel.  But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death.  Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer.In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history.  Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert.It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she.   Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate.  She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press.  Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created.New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include:- How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...",,,10/28/02,November 2003,['Jack the Ripper'],Mass Market Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'History', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'Horror', 'British Literature']",,9780425192733,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388307107l/6538.jpg,3.47,[],326.0,5.0,,6538.Portrait_of_a_Killer,,,,,80.0,33479.0,383,,Berkley,"['7714', '9191', '9902', '4476', '2196']",,,[],,

Patricia Cornwell (Goodreads Author),Unnatural Exposure,,English,,"See alternate cover edition hereVirginia Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta has a bloody puzzle on her hands: five headless, limbless cadavers in Ireland, plus four similar victims in a landfill back home. Is a serial butcher loose in Virginia? That's what the panicked public thinks, thanks to a local TV reporter who got the leaked news from her boyfriend, Scarpetta's vile rival, Investigator Percy Ring. But the butchered bodies are so many red herrings intended to throw idiots like Ring off the track. Instead of a run-of-the-mill serial killer, we're dealing with a shadowy figure who has plans involving mutant smallpox, mass murder, and messing with Scarpetta's mind by e-mailing her gory photos of the murder scenes, along with cryptic AOL chat-room messages. The coolest innovation: Scarpetta's gorgeous genius niece, Lucy, equips her with a DataGlove and a VPL Eyephone, and she takes a creepy virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene.Unnatural Exposure boasts brisk storytelling, crackling dialogue, evocative prose about forensic-science sleuthing, and crisp character sketches, both of familiar characters like Scarpetta's gruff partner Pete Marino and bit players like the landfill employee falsely accused by Ring. Plus, let's face it: serial killers are old hat. Cornwell's most vivid villains are highly plausible backstabbing colleagues like Ring, who plots to destroy Lucy's FBI career by outing her as a lesbian. Some readers object to the rather abrupt ending, but, hey, it's less jarring than Hannibal's, and it's the logical culmination of Cornwell's philosophy about human nature. To illuminate the novel's finale, read Cornwell's remarks on paranoia in her Amazon.com interview. --Tim Appelo",Kay Scarpetta #8,,08/06/97,2000,"['Kay Scarpetta', 'Pete Marino', 'Lucy Farinelli', 'Benton Wesley', 'Keith Pleasants', 'Inspector Percy Ring']",Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Murder Mystery', 'Detective', 'Adult', 'Medical']",,9780751530490,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383293921l/232145.jpg,4.06,[],70.0,1.0,,232145.Unnatural_Exposure,,,,,96.0,53733.0,370,,Time Warner,"['19359', '20843', '11558', '1590', '383']",,,"['United States of America', 'Richmond, Virginia (United States)']",,

Mountain people have always led a difficult life; but how they dealt with their struggles is a unique perspective on Appalachian people.Also, in this book you will find a small section on mountain medicinal treatments and hillbilly proverbs, which were carried over from mother to daughter down the family line. Knowledge of apothecary, or also known as mountain medicine, was necessary to treat family members who became ill while the local doctor was away visiting two towns over. Most importantly, no decent self-respecting mountain folk would ever go unprepared without offering up advice to help their fellow neighbor. Wise sayings or hillbilly proverbs go hand-in-hand with mountain medicine and is given to anyone who might need guidance in their daily life.The second part of the book includes a special story written by one of the original descendants of the Crowe Family, Ms. Verna Humphrey. This short piece of fiction centers around a light romance based right after the end of the Civil War. The setting takes place in Green Cove and it presents a time of struggle and death while a young girl, Charlotte, struggles to regain her birthright during these trying times. When a young lawyer enters upon the scene, Charlotte's interpretation of birthright takes on a whole new meaning. Now she must make some hard decisions that will alter the course of her life.",,,,April 1st 2011,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Poetry']",,9781608622832,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347792827l/11451865.jpg,3.8,['Sigma Tau Delta Literary Guild'],482.0,5.0,,11451865-hillbilly-tales-from-the-smoky-mountains---and-other-homespun-remedies,,,,,85.0,55.0,126,,"E-Booktime, LLC","['20', '14', '13', '6', '2']",,,[],,

Patricia McCormick,"The Plot to Kill Hitler: Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Spy, Unlikely Hero",,,,"Perfect for fans of suspenseful nonfiction such as books by Steve Sheinkin, this is a page-turning narrative about Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and pacifist who became an unlikely hero during World War II and took part in a plot to kill Hitler. Written by two-time National Book Award finalist Patricia McCormick, author of Sold and Never Fall Down and coauthor of the young reader’s edition of I Am Malala.It was April 5, 1943, and the Gestapo would arrive any minute. Dietrich Bonhoeffer had been expecting this day for a long time. He had put his papers in order—and left a few notes specifically for Hitler’s men to see. Two SS agents climbed the stairs and told the boyish-looking Bonhoeffer to come with them. He calmly said good-bye to his parents, put his Bible under his arm, and left. Upstairs there was proof, in his own handwriting, that this quiet young minister was part of a conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler.This compelling, brilliantly researched account includes the remarkable discovery that Bonhoeffer was one of the first people to provide evidence to the Allies that Jews were being deported to death camps. It takes readers from his privileged early childhood to the studies and travel that would introduce him to peace activists around the world—eventually putting this gentle, scholarly pacifist on a deadly course to assassinate one of the most ruthless dictators in history. The Plot to Kill Hitler provides fascinating insights into what makes someone stand up for what’s right when no one else is standing with you. It is a question that every generation must answer again and again.With black-and-white photographs, fascinating sidebars, and thoroughly researched details, this book should be essential reading.",,,,September 13th 2016,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History', 'World War II', 'War', 'Middle Grade', 'Historical', 'Holocaust', 'Biography Memoir', 'Religion']",,9780062411105,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459725239l/28594377.jpg,4.01,[],97.0,1.0,,28594377-the-plot-to-kill-hitler,,,,,95.0,1739.0,192,,Balzer + Bray,"['543', '773', '344', '62', '17']",,,[],,

A tough, lonely ex-Marine of 39, Harlan has never allowed himself to love another man. Then Billy Sive, a brilliant young runner, shows up on his doorstep.

Patricia S. Warrick,Charles Babbage and the Countess,,English,,"Charles Babbage was thirty years old in 1821, as was his close friend, John Herschel, and in English intellectual circles they were both regarded as brilliant mathematicians. One day as Babbage worked in preparing logarithmic tables, a tedious and boring task, he commented to Herschel that he thought he could invent a machine to do these calculations with far more speed and accuracy than a human calculator could. And so was born an idea that would fascinate, tantalize, and absorb him for the remainder of his life. Over the years he drew plans, expanded them, modified them, and finally invented two machines, the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. The first was capable only of generating tables, but the Analytical Engine could do much more. It could convert into numbers and print the results of any formula that might be required. It could also develop any analytical formula the laws of whose formation were given. Using punched cards it could store early results in a calculation and then use them to make further calculations when they were required.

Each entry tells exactly why it's essential to visit. Then come the nuts and bolts: addresses, websites, phone and fax numbers, best times to visit. Stop dreaming and get going.This hefty volume reminds vacationers that hot tourist spots are small percentage of what's worth seeing out there. A quick sampling: Venice's Cipriani Hotel; California's Monterey Peninsula; the Lewis and Clark Trail in Oregon; the Great Wall of China; Robert Louis Stevenson's home in Western Samoa; and the Alhambra in Andalusia, Spain.

Each entry lists exactly where to find the spot (e.g. Moorea is located ""12 miles/19 km northwest of Tahiti; 10 minutes by air, 1 hour by boat"") and when to go (e.g., if you want to check out The Complete Fly Fisher hotel in Montana, ""May and Sept.-Oct. offer productive angling in a solitary setting"").

Patrick D. Smith (Goodreads Author),A Land Remembered,,English,,"A Land Remembered has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times in annual polls conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine.In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife.A Land Remembered was winner of the Florida Historical Society's Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel.

Patrick Deville,Peste & Choléra,,French,,"Quand Louis Pasteur expérimente avec succès le vaccin contre la rage, il ouvre de nouvelles etformidables perspectives à la biologie et à la médecine. Il chargera plus tard ses élèves ou disciples de prolonger ses recherches à travers le monde. Les jeunes pasteuriens partent pour de longs périples.Parmi eux, Alexandre Yersin, d’origine suisse (il est né à Morges en 1863), naturalisé Français pour les besoins de la science, qui se forme sur le tas et part très vite en Indochine, où il passera le plus clair de sa vie, loin des brouhahas parisiens et des fracas guerriers. Il multiplie là-bas les observations épidémiologiques mais aussi bien géographiques, astronomiques ou météorologiques. C’est que ces jeunes gens sont curieux de tout, Yersin en particulier.Ami du politicien Doumer, Yersin se trouve à l’origine de la ville de Dalat, dans l’actuel Vietnam, puis il s’installe à Nha Trang pour y mener passionnément ses multiples activités de chercheur. Elevage bovin, culture de l’hévéa, des orchidées, de la quinine : il pourrait faire fortune mais tout va au financement des recherches et de l’Institut Pasteur créé entre-temps. La science l’absorbe, il n’aura ni femme ni enfant. Parfois il revient en Europe, mais c’est le plus souvent de loin, à la radio ou par les journaux, qu’il reçoit l’écho des conflits mondiaux et de leurs atrocités. Il meurt en 1943, conscient mais pas tout à fait amer que son nom n’aura pas la même gloire posthume que son maître, Louis Pasteur, et demeurera essentiellement attaché à la découverte du bacille de la peste à Hong-Kong en 1894.C’est cette formidable aventure scientifique et humaine que raconte Deville en croisant les périodes et les personnages autour de la figure de Yersin.",,,11/06/12,August 23rd 2012,[],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Science', 'France', 'Nonfiction', 'Historical', 'Roman', 'History', 'War', 'Adventure', 'Medicine']",,9782021077209,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346281912l/15874968.jpg,3.73,"['Prix Femina (2012)', 'Prix du roman Fnac (2012)', 'Prix des prix littéraires (2012)']",79.0,1.0,,15874968-peste-chol-ra,,,,,88.0,981.0,224,,Seuil (Fiction & Cie),"['249', '372', '238', '91', '31']",,,[],,

Alongside his humor, McManus's inimitable vision consistently evokes a childlike wonder at the natural world.

A Time of Gifts is the first volume in a trilogy recounting the trip, and takes the reader with him as far as Hungary. It is a book of compelling glimpses - not only of the events which were curdling Europe at that time, but also of its resplendent domes and monasteries, its great rivers, the sun on the Bavarian snow, the storks and frogs, the hospitable burgomasters who welcomed him, and that world's grandeurs and courtesies. His powers of recollection have astonishing sweep and verve, and the scope is majestic.

Patrick Lencioni,The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business,,English,,"There is a competitive advantage out there, arguably more powerful than any other. Is it superior strategy? Faster innovation? Smarter employees? No, New York Times best-selling author, Patrick Lencioni, argues that the seminal difference between successful companies and mediocre ones has little to do with what they know and how smart they are and more to do with how healthy they are. In this book, Lencioni brings together his vast experience and many of the themes cultivated in his other best-selling books and delivers a first: a cohesive and comprehensive exploration of the unique advantage organizational health provides. Simply put, an organization is healthy when it is whole, consistent and complete, when its management, operations and culture are unified. Healthy organizations outperform their counterparts, are free of politics and confusion and provide an environment where star performers never want to leave. Lencioni's first non-fiction book provides leaders with a groundbreaking, approachable model for achieving organizational health--complete with stories, tips and anecdotes from his experiences consulting to some of the nation's leading organizations. In this age of informational ubiquity and nano-second change, it is no longer enough to build a competitive advantage based on intelligence alone.

"Patrick Modiano, Daniel Weissbort (Translator)",Missing Person,,English,,"WINNER OF THE 2014 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE!Winner of the Prix GoncourtIn this strange, elegant novel, winner of France's premier literary prize, Patrick Modiano portrays a man in pursuit of the identity he lost in the murky days of the Paris Occupation, the black hole of French memory.For ten years Guy Roland has lived without a past. His current life and name were given to him by his recently retired boss, Hutte, who welcomed him, a onetime client, into his detective agency. Guy makes full use of Hutte's files – directories, yearbooks, and papers of all kinds going back half a century – but his leads are few. Could he really be the person in that photograph, a young man remembered by some as a South American attaché? Or was he someone else, perhaps the disappeared scion of a prominent local family? He interviews strangers and is tantalized by half-clues until, at last, he grasps a thread that leads him through the maze of his own repressed experience.On one level Missing Person is a detective thriller, a 1950s film noir mix of smoky cafés, illegal passports, and insubstantial figures crossing bridges in the fog. On another level, it is also a haunting meditation on the nature of the self. Modiano's sparce, hypnotic prose, superbly translated by Daniel Weissbort, draws his readers into the intoxication of a rare literary experience.Librarian's note: See an alternate cover edition for this ISBN here.",,Verba Mundi,09/05/78,November 30th 2004,"['Guy Roland', 'Hutte']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'France', 'Nobel Prize', 'Mystery', 'French Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century', 'Contemporary']",,9781567922813,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455071422l/192378._SY475_.jpg,3.63,"['Prix Goncourt (1978)', 'French-American Foundation Translation Prize for Fiction (2005)']",67.0,1.0,,192378.Missing_Person,,,,,89.0,6642.0,168,,David R.

They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders.",,,11/01/18,February 26th 2019,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Ireland', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'Irish Literature', 'Mystery']",,9780385521314,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1537315266l/40163119._SY475_.jpg,4.42,"['National Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Orwell Prize for Political Writing (2019)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2019)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2019)']",129.0,2.0,,40163119-say-nothing,,,,,98.0,42788.0,441,,Doubleday,"['23956', '14277', '3541', '685', '329']",,,[],,

Patrick Rothfuss (Goodreads Author),The Wise Man's Fear,,English,,"“There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.”My name is Kvothe.I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.You may have heard of me.So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.",The Kingkiller Chronicle #2,First Edition,,03/01/11,"['Bast', 'Denna', 'Ambrose', 'Kvothe', 'Simmon', 'Wilem', 'The Chandrian', 'Maer Alveron', 'Felurian', 'Devi', 'Tempi', 'Auri', 'Fela', 'Chronicler']",Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Epic']",,9780756404734,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452624392l/1215032.jpg,4.56,"['Locus Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Novel (2012)', 'David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2012)', 'Tähtifantasia Award Nominee (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Fantasy and for Favorite Book (2011)', 'Prix Elbakin.net for Meilleur roman fantasy traduit (2013)']",40195.0,443.0,,1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear,,,,,98.0,427730.0,994,,DAW Books,"['289930', '99533', '27990', '7009', '3268']",,,[],,

"Patrick Rothfuss (Goodreads Author), Nate Taylor (Illustrator)",The Slow Regard of Silent Things,,English,,"Deep below the University, there is a dark place. Few people know of it: a broken web of ancient passageways and abandoned rooms. A young woman lives there, tucked among the sprawling tunnels of the Underthing, snug in the heart of this forgotten place.Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auri’s life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auri’s eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows...In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of The Kingkiller Chronicle’s most enigmatic characters. Full of secrets and mysteries, The Slow Regard of Silent Things is the story of a broken girl trying to live in a broken world.AUTHOR’S FOREWORD You might not want to buy this book.I know, that’s not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. The marketing people aren’t going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I’d rather be honest with you right out of the gate.First, if you haven’t read my other books, you don’t want to start here.My first two books are The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man’s Fear. If you’re curious to try my writing, start there. They’re the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you’re probably going to feel pretty lost.Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it’s only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don’t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn’t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you’re looking for a continuation of Kvothe’s storyline, you’re not going to find it here.On the other hand, if you’d like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you’re curious about the Underthing and alchemy. If you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world...Well, then this book might be for you.",The Kingkiller Chronicle #2.5,First Edition,,October 28th 2014,['Auri'],Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'High Fantasy', 'Novella', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Magic']",,9780756410438,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398466695l/21535271.jpg,3.9,"['David Gemmell Ravenheart Award Nominee for Best Fantasy Cover Art (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy (2014)', 'Reddit r/fantasy Stabby Award for Best Short Fiction (2014)']",1577.0,18.0,,21535271-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things,,,,,89.0,115366.0,159,,DAW Books,"['42110', '36382', '23877', '8867', '4130']",,,['The Underthing'],,

"Patrick Swayze, Lisa Niemi Swayze",The Time of My Life,,English,,"In a career spanning more than thirty years, Patrick Swayze has made a name for himself on the stage, the screen, and television. Known for his versatility, passion and fearlessness, he's become one of our most beloved actors. But in February 2008, Patrick announced he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Always a fighter, he refused to let the disease bring him to his knees, and his bravery has inspired both his legion of fans and cancer patients everywhere. Yet this memoir, written with wisdom and heart, recounts much more than his bout with cancer. In vivid detail, Patrick describes his Texas upbringing, his personal struggles, his rise to fame with North and South, his commercial breakthroughs in Dirty Dancing and Ghost, and the soul mate who's stood by his side through it all: his wife, writer and director Lisa Niemi. A behind-the-scenes look at a Hollywood life and a remarkable love, this memoir is both entertainment and inspiration. Patrick and Lisa's marriage is a journey of two lives intertwined and lived as one--throughout their years in Hollywood and at home on their working ranch outside Los Angeles, and culminating in the hope and wisdom they've imparted to all who know them. This book will open the door for families, individuals, and husbands and wives to grow, bond and discover entirely new levels of love and sharing, proving that life shouldn't be lived as a series of endings, but rather as the beginning of greater strength and love.",,,05/08/07,September 29th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Inspirational', 'Relationships', 'Pop Culture', 'American']",,9781439158586,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440733198l/6681627._SY475_.jpg,4.05,[],77.0,1.0,,6681627-the-time-of-my-life,,,,,94.0,6862.0,244,,Atria Books,"['2649', '2408', '1416', '277', '112']",,,[],,

Paul A. Offit,Pandora's Lab: Seven Stories of Science Gone Wrong,,English,,"What happens when ideas presented as science lead us in the wrong direction? History is filled with brilliant ideas that gave rise to disaster, and this book explores the most fascinating—and significant—missteps: from opium's heyday as the pain reliever of choice to recognition of opioids as a major cause of death in the U.S.; from the rise of trans fats as the golden ingredient for tastier, cheaper food to the heart disease epidemic that followed; and from the cries to ban DDT for the sake of the environment to an epidemic-level rise in world malaria. These are today's sins of science—as deplorable as mistaken past ideas about advocating racial purity or using lobotomies as a cure for mental illness. These unwitting errors add up to seven lessons both cautionary and profound, narrated by renowned author and speaker Paul A. Offit.

In 1929 the house was investigated by the ""Daily Mail"" and paranormal researcher Harry Price, and it was he who called it 'the most haunted house in England'. Price also took out a lease of the rectory from 1937 to 1938, recruiting forty-eight 'official observers' to monitor occurences.

When sleep refuses to come, he lies in bed and tells himself stories, struggling to push back thoughts about things he would prefer to forget—his wife’s recent death and the horrific murder of his granddaughter’s boyfriend, Titus. The retired book critic imagines a parallel world in which America is not at war with Iraq but with itself. In this other America the twin towers did not fall and the 2000 election results led to secession, as state after state pulled away from the union and a bloody civil war ensued. As the night progresses, Brill’s story grows increasingly intense, and what he is so desperately trying to avoid insists on being told. Joined in the early hours by his granddaughter, he gradually opens up to her and recounts the story of his marriage. After she falls asleep, he at last finds the courage to revisit the trauma of Titus’s death.Passionate and shocking, Man in the Dark is a novel of our moment, a book that forces us to confront the blackness of night even as it celebrates the existence of ordinary joys in a world capable of the most grotesque violence.*Time Out (Chicago)",,,10/28/08,August 1st 2008,['August Brill'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'The United States Of America', 'Literary Fiction', 'Americana', '21st Century', 'War']",,9780571240760,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327920218l/3136288.jpg,3.6,['International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2010)'],257.0,3.0,,3136288-man-in-the-dark,,,,,90.0,9147.0,180,,Faber and Faber,"['1465', '3621', '3118', '792', '151']",,,[],,
Paul Auster,Travels in the Scriptorium,,English,,"
  
    A man pieces together clues to his past--and the identity of his captors--in this fantastic, labyrinthine novel
  
  An old man awakens, disoriented, in an unfamiliar chamber. With no memory of who he is or how he has arrived there, he pores over the relics on the desk, examining the circumstances of his confinement and searching his own hazy mind for clues.
  Determining that he is locked in, the man--identified only as Mr. Blank--begins reading a manuscript he finds on the desk, the story of another prisoner, set in an alternate world the man doesn't recognize. Nevertheless, the pages seem to have been left for him, along with a haunting set of photographs. As the day passes, various characters call on the man in his cell--vaguely familiar people, some who seem to resent him for crimes he can't remember--and each brings frustrating hints of his identity and his past. All the while an overhead camera clicks and clicks, recording his movements, and a microphone records every sound in the room. Someone is watching.
  Both chilling and poignant, Travels in the Scriptorium is vintage Auster: mysterious texts, fluid identities, a hidden past, and, somewhere, an obscure tormentor. And yet, as we discover during one day in the life of Mr. Blank, his world is not so different from our own.

Before long, Walker finds himself caught in a perverse triangle that leads to a sudden, shocking act of violence that will alter the course of his life.Three different narrators tell the story of Invisible, a novel that travels in time from 1967 to 2007 and moves from Morningside Heights, to the Left Bank of Paris, to a remote island in the Caribbean. It is a book of youthful rage, unbridled sexual hunger, and a relentless quest for justice.

"Paul Bowles, Daniel Halpern (Editor)",Collected Stories and Later Writings,,English,,"Paul Bowles had already established himself as an important composer when at age 39 he published The Sheltering Sky and became recognized as one of the most powerful writers of the postwar period. From his base in Tangier he produced globally ranging novels, stories, and travel writings that set exquisite surfaces over violent undercurrents. His elegantly spare novels chart the unpredictable collisions between ""civilized"" exiles and a Morocco they never grasp, achieving effects of extreme horror and dislocation.This Library of America Bowles set, the first annotated edition, offers the full range of his achievement: the portrait of an outsider who was one of the essential American writers of the last century. In addition to his novels -- The Sheltering Sky (1949), Let It Come Down (1952), The Spider's House (1955), Up Above the World (1966) -- and his collected stories -- including such classics as ""A Distant Episode"" and ""Pages from Cold Point"" -- they contain his masterpiece of travel writing, Their Heads Are Green and Their Hands Are Blue (1963). Throughout, Bowles shows himself a master of gothic terror and a diabolically funny observer of manners as well as a prescient guide to everything from the roots of Islamist politics to the world of Moghrebi music. With a hallucinatory clarity as dry and unforgiving as the desert air, Bowles sends his characters toward encounters with unknown and terrifying forces both outside them and within them.",,,10/30/79,August 26th 2002,[],Hardcover,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Anthologies']",,9781931082204,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924819l/12052.jpg,4.43,[],154.0,2.0,,12052.Collected_Stories_and_Later_Writings,,,,,99.0,137.0,1050,,Library of America,"['76', '46', '13', '2', '0']",,,[],,

Paul C. Jong,A Fail-Safe Way for You to Receive the Holy Spirit,,English,,"In Christianity today, the most frequently discussed issues are ""salvation from sin"" and ""the indwelling of the Holy Spirit."" However, few people have precise knowledge of these two ideas, despite the fact that they are the two most important concepts in Christianity. What is worse, we can't find any biblical writing that teaches us clearly about the issues above. There have been lots of Christian authors glorifying the gifts of the Holy Spirit or describing the Spirit-filled lives. But any of them doesn't dare to deal with the fundamental question, ""How can a believer surely receive the Holy Spirit?"" Why? Surprising truth is that they couldn't write about it in full-scale because they didn't have exact knowledge of it. As Prophet Hosea cried out, ""My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,"" nowadays, not a few Christians are drawn into religious fanaticism, hoping to receive the Holy Spirit. They believe that they will receive the Holy Spirit by reaching a state of frenzy and hysteria. But it is no exaggeration to say that their so-called faith reduces Christianity to mere shallow Shamanism, and that such fanaticism derives from Satan.The author Rev. Paul C. Jong dares to proclaim the truth. He deals the essential subjects in full-scale, which most spiritual writers have evaded for a long time. He first defines the meaning of ""being born again"" and ""the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,"" and explains the inevitable relationship between the two pivotal concepts. Then he runs the whole gamut of description concerning the Holy Spirit, from ""how to discern the spirits"" to ""the way to Spirit-filled lives.""

"Paul Clements, Paul Clements, Marc Isambard Brunel (Topic)",Marc Isambard Brunel,,English,,"Marc Isambard Brunel (1769-1849) nourished an extraordinary intellect, in spite of a tyrannical father. After serving in Louis XVI's navy as an officer cadet, he left France and, at the age of 30, came to Britain via America; 50 years later he died here. Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) nourished an equally extraordinary intellect. On leaving his native island of Corsica he went to France, where he became First Consul aged 30 and waged war against Britain. He died in St. Helena 22 years later. This revised biography of Marc Brunel reveals, for the first time, how both these temperamentally opposed men labored, unceasingly and with great courage, on behalf of their adopted countries, and how much Marc Brunel contributed to Napoleon's ultimate defeat. Marc Brunel was a man without malice. In addition to being an inventor, artist, and musician, he was the 19th century's most innovative engineer. Until recently, however, he has been acknowledged less for his achievements than for fathering his brilliant and indefatigable son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-59). Until the age of 56, Marc Brunel was primarily an inventor, but Isambard took his father's and others' inventions when they were barely visible seeds and turned them into highly visible fruits in the shape of steam ships and railways. Marc Brunel worked in a relatively literate age and his frequently forthright comments were eagerly sought by reporters of many newly established daily papers. He never became a ""celebrity.""

Paul Collins,Banvard's Folly,Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change the World,,History,"The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins' Banvard's Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as ""The Three Mile Painting"") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed ""William Shakespeare"" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins' love for what he calls the ""forgotten ephemera of genius"" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard's Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.",,,,2002.0,,,,0312300336,9780312300333,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSv6w5Ba2Y4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.97,,,,,,,,,,,,320.0,,,,498.0,,,,

"Paul Copan, Matt Flannagan",Did God Really Command Genocide?: Coming to Terms with the Justice of God,,,,"A common objection to belief in the God of the Bible is that a good, kind, and loving deity would never command the wholesale slaughter of nations. Even Christians have a hard time stomaching such a thought, and many avoid reading those difficult Old Testament passages that make us squeamish. Instead, we quickly jump to the enemy-loving, forgiving Jesus of the New Testament. And yet, the question doesn't go away. Did God really command genocide? Is the command to ""utterly destroy"" morally unjustifiable? Is it literal? Are the issues more complex and nuanced than we realize?In the tradition of his popular Is God a Moral Monster?, Paul Copan teams up with Matthew Flannagan to tackle some of the most confusing and uncomfortable passages of Scripture. Together they help the Christian and nonbeliever alike understand the biblical, theological, philosophical, and ethical implications of Old Testament warfare passages.

Paul Cronin,Herzog on Herzog,Conversations with Paul Cronin,,Performing Arts,"An invaluable set of career-length interviews with the German genius hailed by François Truffaut as ""the most important film director alive"" Most of what we've heard about Werner Herzog is untrue. The sheer number of false rumors and downright lies disseminated about the man and his films is truly astonishing. Yet Herzog's body of work is one of the most important in postwar European cinema. His international breakthrough came in 1973 with Aguirre, The Wrath of God, in which Klaus Kinski played a crazed Conquistador. For The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Herzog cast in the lead a man who had spent most of his life institutionalized, and two years later he hypnotized his entire cast to make Heart of Glass. He rushed to an explosive volcanic Caribbean island to film La Soufrière, paid homage to F. W. Murnau in a terrifying remake of Nosferatu, and in 1982 dragged a boat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle for Fitzcarraldo. More recently, Herzog has made extraordinary ""documentary"" films such as Little Dieter Needs to Fly. His place in cinema history is assured, and Paul Cronin's volume of dialogues provides a forum for Herzog's fascinating views on the things, ideas, and people that have preoccupied him for so many years.",,,,2003.0,,,,0571207081,9780571207084,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kRzxwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.44,,,,,,,,,,,,352.0,,,,1344.0,,,,

This book identifies the original design and purpose of the Stonehenge Ritual Landscape. It will change your understanding of the people who built the first and largest monument and many other mid-Neolithic structures that remain vital to functioning of this sacred landscape. You will discover the Stonehenge Landscape is the oldest and best preserved example of astronomically-related sacred symbolism ever constructed.In addition, Burley describes the purpose of heretofore enigmatic megalithic Stonehenge. His discovery was made while researching the objective of four stones inside the henge yet unnoticed by thousands of people viewing the monument each day. They are the Station Stones. Overshadowed by circles of much larger stones, the Station Stones justify the entire monument itself. They are the key to understanding the annual conception of new life by Earth Goddess and Sky King.Stonehenge: As Above So Below includes more than 90 illustrations.

In Memphis, Tennessee, Dr. David Freeman is given a strange wooden bead by a dying patient and soon finds himself pursued by a murderous band of Zulus, thought to be responsible for the gruesome murders of three elderly gentlemen in London, England.

  The Keynes Solution
 author Paul Davidson provides insights into how we got into the crisis—but more importantly how to use Keynes economic philosophy to get out of this mess. John Maynard Keynes was committed to making the market economy work—but our current system has been a dismal failure. Keynes advocated for an interventionalist government role, in cooperation with private initiative, to mitigate the adverse effects of recessions, depressions and booms. His economic policy helped the world out of the great depression and was an important influencer in the thinking behind FDR's new deal policies. In this book Keynesian expert Davidson makes recommendations and details plans for spending, monetary policy, financial market rules and regulation, and wages—all to reverse the effects of our past policies.

If life once existed on Mars, might it have originated there and traveled to earth inside meteorites blasted into space by cosmic impacts?  Davies builds on recent scientific discoveries and theories to address larger questions of existence: What, exactly, is life? Is it the inevitable by-product of physical laws, as many scientists maintain, or an almost miraculous accident? Are we alone in the universe, or will life emerge on all earthlike planets? And if there is life elsewhere in the universe, is it preordained to evolve toward greater complexity and intelligence?

And, perhaps the death knell for his burgeoning sex life, Paul was a tap dance student. (And we have the pictures to prove it—see the front cover.)Infused with the same witty and infectiously readable style of his first book, Kick Me, Superstud chronicles the trials and tribulations of Feig’s young dating life with all the same excruciating detail as an on-air gastric bypass—and you just won’t be able to tear yourself away. Feig’s series of shudder-to-think but oddly familiar (come on—we’ve all been dumped by someone we didn’t even like that much) anecdotes include: his first date, at an REO Speedwagon concert with the most endowed girl in school, who leaves him sitting next to a puddle of puke; his first breakup, accomplished by moving across the country; his mortifying date with his secretly bigoted girlfriend; his discovery of a new self-love technique that almost lands him in the hospital; and his less-than-idealistic “first time,” which he nevertheless elevates to biblical proportions. In Superstud, Paul Feig tells all in a hilarious but true testament to geekdom, love, and growing up.",,,01/01/05,June 28th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Biography', 'Comedy', 'Biography Memoir', 'Essays', 'Coming Of Age', 'Autobiography', 'Adult']",,9781400051755,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320445026l/95531.jpg,3.79,[],95.0,1.0,,95531.Superstud,,,,,92.0,1567.0,304,,Three Rivers Press,"['391', '617', '429', '97', '33']",,,[],,

Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls “an intellectual Wild West.”The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live.

Paul Halbeck (Goodreads Author),Journey To Healing and Wholeness,,,,"This is written as a ""healing journey,"" not just as a book on healing, I think you will find it to be much broader in its scope than that. For I am writing this not just from academic knowledge, but as I write it, I am also going through this same journey to receive my healing.The book will guide the reader through the Word of God in a logical progression of steps, making the reader aware of the power behind the Word, for Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly, John 10:10. God's Word is able to meet all of our needs if we but let His Word work in our lives, for we are generally the one's that limit the Word from working. The Word can heal us both emotional, physically and bring us into a closer and a deeper relationship with Him.If the world that we live in was actually created by God's Word, (Jesus), John 1:3, then God's Word is the parent force of all creation. Scripture goes on to say, all things were created by Him and for Him, Colossians 1:16; thus Jesus had a purpose for creating His creation. If these two scriptures are true, then it would be to our benefit to learn about this Man Jesus Christ and His Word. If our focus remains on the Word, we will then be lead into that abundant life, that Jesus came to give us, rather than just settling for what the world can give us.The manuscript addresses many relevant topics in every day language concerning God's Word. There are many short and concise chapter topics, as shown in the table of contents: * IntroductionBeginning mind-sets: * God's Word the healing power  * Knowing that God is your Father  * Realizing that God is a good God  * Knowing God's love for you  * Knowing that God wants you well  * Having a strong desire to get well  * Leaving your past hurts in the past  * Will you receive God forgiveness? * You are worthy of God's healing  * Letting God's Word become real  * Desiring a closer walk with Him  * Having a thankful heart  * It will be done according to your faith  * A living God and His living Word  * Do not disqualify My people Pursuing every healing path possible: * Jesus took our infirmities  * Imagination and hope, a primary step  * What scriptures are you standing on  * Speaking life instead of death  * Speaking God's Word over your body  * Are you willing to be carried?  * Will you accept His free gift of healing  * Having the elders pray over you  * Asking others for a prayer of agreement  * Participating in Holy Communion  * Praise and worship, a powerful tool  * Healed by the spirit within us  * Walking in the authority as a son of God  * Having the Lord rebuke the devourer Biblical healing philosophies: * It's all about what Jesus accomplished  * Making the commitment to succeed  * It's a spiritual battle not a physical one  * Not quitting before the war is over  * As a man thinks in his heart so is he * Making God's Word your life source  * Living out of the spirit and not the flesh  * Natural healing vs. divine healing  * Healing vs. walking in wholeness  * Healing and wholeness, in this lifetime  * Becoming poor in spirit  * When you have done all, keep standing  * OK, I am standing, now what?

Paul Ham (Goodreads Author),Kokoda,,,,"For the first time ever, the compelling story of the infamous Kokoda Track campaign has been told from both sides of the conflict.In a unique and balanced portrayal, renowned journalist Paul Ham recounts both the Australian and Japanese perspectives of the events on the hellish Papuan jungle trail where thousands fought and died during World War II. Based on extensive research in Australia and Japan, and including previously unpublished documents, Kokoda intimately relates the stories of ordinary soldiers in 'the world's worst killing field', and examines the role of commanders in sending ill-equipped, unqualified Australian troops into battles that resulted in near 100 per cent casualty rates. It was a war without mercy, fought back and forth along 90 miles (145 km) of river crossings, steep inclines and precipitous descents, with both sides wracked by hunger and disease, and terrified of falling into enemy hands. Defeat was unthinkable: the Australian soldier was fighting for his homeland against an unyielding aggressor; the Japanese ordered to fight to the death in a bid to conquer 'Greater East Asia'.

Paul Hendrickson,"Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961",,English,,"From a National Book Critics Circle Award winner, a brilliantly conceived and illuminating reconsideration of a key period in the life of Ernest Hemingway that will forever change the way he is perceived and understood.Focusing on the years 1934 to 1961—from Hemingway’s pinnacle as the reigning monarch of American letters until his suicide—Paul Hendrickson traces the writer’s exultations and despair around the one constant in his life during this time: his beloved boat, Pilar.We follow him from Key West to Paris, to New York, Africa, Cuba, and finally Idaho, as he wrestles with his best angels and worst demons. Whenever he could, he returned to his beloved fishing cruiser, to exult in the sea, to fight the biggest fish he could find, to drink, to entertain celebrities and friends and seduce women, to be with his children. But as he began to succumb to the diseases of fame, we see that Pilar was also where he cursed his critics, saw marriages and friendships dissolve, and tried, in vain, to escape his increasingly diminished capacities.Generally thought of as a great writer and an unappealing human being, Hemingway emerges here in a far more benevolent light. Drawing on previously unpublished material, including interviews with Hemingway’s sons, Hendrickson shows that for all the writer’s boorishness, depression, and alcoholism, and despite his choleric anger, he was capable of remarkable generosity—to struggling writers, to lost souls, to the dying son of a friend.We see most poignantly his relationship with his youngest son, Gigi, a doctor who lived his adult life mostly as a cross-dresser, and died squalidly and alone in a Miami women’s jail. He was the son Hemingway forsook the least, yet the one who disappointed him the most, as Gigi acted out for nearly his whole life so many of the tortured, ambiguous tensions his father felt. Hendrickson’s bold and beautiful book strikingly makes the case that both men were braver than we know, struggling all their lives against the complicated, powerful emotions swirling around them. As Hendrickson writes, “Amid so much ruin, still the beauty.”Hemingway’s Boat is both stunningly original and deeply gripping, an invaluable contribution to our understanding of this great American writer, published fifty years after his death.",,,,September 20th 2011,['Ernest Hemingway'],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Collections', 'Books About Books', 'Literature', 'Unfinished', 'Memoir', 'Writing']",,9781400041626,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347588630l/10497786.jpg,3.73,"['Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction (2012)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography (2011)']",92.0,1.0,,10497786-hemingway-s-boat,,,,,88.0,1819.0,534,,Alfred A.

Paul Hoffman,The Left Hand of God,,English,,"“Listen. The Sanctuary of the Redeemers on Shotover Scarp is named after a damned lie for there is no redemption that goes on there and less sanctuary.”The Sanctuary of the Redeemers is a vast and desolate place—a place without joy or hope. Most of its occupants were taken there as boys and for years have endured the brutal regime of the Lord Redeemers whose cruelty and violence have one singular purpose—to serve in the name of the One True Faith.In one of the Sanctuary’s vast and twisting maze of corridors stands a boy. He is perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old—he is not sure and neither is anyone else. He has long-forgotten his real name, but now they call him Thomas Cale. He is strange and secretive, witty and charming, violent and profoundly bloody-minded. He is so used to the cruelty that he seems immune, but soon he will open the wrong door at the wrong time and witness an act so terrible that he will have to leave this place, or die.His only hope of survival is to escape across the arid Scablands to Memphis, a city the opposite of the Sanctuary in every way: breathtakingly beautiful, infinitely Godless, and deeply corrupt.

Paul Hoffman,The Last Four Things,,English,,"The epic story of Thomas Cale-introduced so memorably in ""The Left Hand of God""--continues as the Redeemers use his prodigious gifts to further their sacred goal: the extinction of humankind and the end of the world.  To the warrior-monks known as the Redeemers, who rule over massive armies of child slaves, ""the last four things"" represent the culmination of a faithful life. Death. Judgement. Heaven. Hell. The last four things represent eternal bliss-or endless destruction, permanent chaos, and infinite pain.  Perhaps nowhere are the competing ideas of heaven and hell exhibited more clearly than in the dark and tormented soul of Thomas Cale. Betrayed by his beloved but still marked by a child's innocence, possessed of a remarkable aptitude for violence but capable of extreme tenderness, Cale will lead the Redeemers into a battle for nothing less than the fate of the human race. And though his broken heart foretells the bloody trail he will leave in pursuit of a personal peace he can never achieve, a glimmer of hope remains. The question even Cale can't answer: When it comes time to decide the fate of the world, to ensure the extermination of humankind or spare it, what will he choose? To express God's will on the edge of his sword, or to forgive his fellow man-and himself?

Paul Johnson,The Birth of the Modern: World Society 1815-1830,,English,,"This extraordinary chronicle of fifteen years that laid the foundations of the modern world is the history of people, ideas, politics, manners and morals, economics, art, science and technology, diplomacy, business and commerce, literature and revolution. From Wellington at Waterloo and Jackson at New Orleans to the surge of democratic power and the new forces of reform that emerged by 1830, this is a portrait of a period of great and rapid changes that saw the United States transform itself from an ex—colony into a formidable nation; Britain become the first industrial world power; Russia develop the fatal flaws that would engulf her in the 20th century and China and Japan set the stage for future development and catastrophe. Latin America became independent, and the dawn of modernity appeared in Turkey and Egypt, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans.It was an age of new ideas, inventions and great technological advances of every kind. Throughout the world the last wildernesses from Canada to the Himalayas to the Andes were being penetrated and settled. The new and expanding cities were being beautified—Boston was lit by gas in 1822; New York and London were being paved. There were steamboats on the Mississippi as early as 1811; the first railroad was built in 1825 in England, and in 1826 the Erie Canal was completed. Charles Babbage invented the first computer, and Turner, Constable, Delacroix and Géricault were fashioning the visual grammar of modern art. Jane Austen finished Emma during Napoleon’s Hundred Days; Goethe presided over the German literary establishment, - and Hegel was creating the theory of the modern state. Beethoven was writing his Ninth Symphony and Mendelssohn his Midsummer Night’s Dream. Byron, Shelley, Keats and Victor Hugo were leading figures in the Romantic Movement. Despite the immense social strains of the Industrial Revolution and the expansion of society, constitutional government was able to survive, initiating and sustaining reforms affecting almost every part of society. And, after Waterloo, an international order was established that, for the most part, endured for a century.ln Paul Johnson's words, “The age abounded in great personalities; warriors, statesmen and tyrants; outstanding inventors and technologists; and writers, artists and musicians of the highest genius, women as well as men. I have brought them to the fore but I have also sought to paint in background, showing how ordinary men and women-—and children—lived, suffered and died, ate and drank, worked, played and traveled."" This was the era of Wellington, Castlereagh, Metternich, Talleyrand and Bolivar; of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Washington and Chateaubriand; of Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday and Robert Fulton; of Madame de Staél, Mary Shelley, Lady Holland and Maria Edgeworth; of John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson; of Goya, Richard Bonington and Thomas Cole.Provocative, challenging and readable, Paul Johnson’s book covers the whole spectrum of history and human affairs, bringing together the various strands into a coherent narrative and telling it through the lives and actions of its outstanding, curious and ordinary people.",,,01/01/88,April 24th 1992,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', '19th Century', 'European History', 'World History', 'Science', 'American History', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy']",,9780060922825,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387739051l/1020951.jpg,4.14,[],51.0,1.0,,1020951.The_Birth_of_the_Modern,,,,,96.0,705.0,1095,,Harper Perennial,"['279', '285', '112', '22', '7']",,,[],,

Paul Kalanithi,When Breath Becomes Air,,English,,"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all.

Paul Kelly,How to Make Gravy,,English,,"This extraordinary book has its genesis in a series of concerts first staged in 2004. Over four nights Paul Kelly performed, in alphabetical order, one hundred of his songs from the previous three decades. In between songs he told stories about them, and from those little tales grew How to Make Gravy, a memoir like no other. Each of its hundred chapters, also in alphabetical order by song title, consists of lyrics followed by a story, the nature of the latter taking its cue from the former. Some pieces are confessional, some tell Kelly's personal and family history, some take you on a road tour with the band, some form an idiosyncratic history of popular music, some are like small essays, some stand as a kind of how-to of the songwriter's art – from the point of inspiration to writing, honing, collaborating, performing, recording and reworking.Paul Kelly is a born storyteller. Give him two verses with a chorus or 550 pages, but he won't waste a word. How to Make Gravy is a long volume that's as tight as a three-piece band. There isn't a topic this man can't turn his pen to – contemporary music and the people who play it, football, cricket, literature, opera, social issues, love, loss, poetry, the land and the history of Australia … there are even quizzes. The writing is insightful, funny, honest, compassionate, intelligent, playful, erudite, warm, thought-provoking. Paul Kelly is a star with zero pretensions, an everyman who is also a renaissance man. He thinks and loves and travels and reads widely, and his musical memoir is destined to become a classic – it doesn't have a bum note on it.",,,09/22/10,October 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Australia', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",,9781926428222,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348810351l/9364112.jpg,4.3,"[""Prime Minister's Literary Awards Nominee for Nonfiction (2011)"", 'Australian Independent Booksellers Indie Book Award Nominee for Non-Fiction (2011)', 'Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for Biography (2011)']",99.0,1.0,,9364112-how-to-make-gravy,,,,,96.0,627.0,576,,Penguin Books Australia,"['313', '215', '77', '16', '6']",,,[],,
Paul Kengor,The Crusader,Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism,,Political Science,"Based on extraordinary research: a major reassessment of Ronald Reagan's lifelong crusade to dismantle the Soviet Empire–including shocking revelations about the liberal American politician who tried to collude with USSR to counter Reagan's efforts Paul Kengor's God and Ronald Reagan made presidential historian Paul Kengor's name as one of the premier chroniclers of the life and career of the 40th president. Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan's efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the ""Evil Empire."" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency. The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician–still in office today–in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan's 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan's policies were in the 1980s.",,,,2006.0,,,,0061136905,9780061136900,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iWR3AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.2,,,,,,,,,,,,432.0,,,,132.0,,,,

(How is it, he asks, that living creatures perform some cognitive tasks so swiftly and easily, where computers do them only badly or not at all?)

"Paul McGee (Goodreads Author), Fiona Griffiths (Illustrator)","Sumo (Shut Up, Move On): The Straight-Talking Guide to Creating and Enjoying a Brilliant Life",,English,,"S.U.M.O. stands for Shut Up, Move On. It's a phrase to say to ourselves (and sometimes others) when we are acting or thinking in a way that is hindering our ability to succeed. It doesn't necessarily mean 'get over it' or 'pull yourself together' (although there may be occasions when both responses are necessary). 'Shut Up' means stop what you're doing, take time out to reflect, let go of baggage and beliefs that hinder your potential. 'Move On' means tomorrow can be different from today, look for new possibilities, don't just think about it, take action. There are six S.U.M.O. principles that are designed to help you create and enjoy a brilliant life. If you are wrestling with life's challenges, these principles will help you do so more successfully.1. Change Your T-Shirt - take responsibility for your own life and don't be a victim. 2. Develop Fruity Thinking - change your thinking and change your results. 3. Hippo Time is OK - understand how setbacks affect you and how to recover from them. 4. Remember the Beachball - increase your understanding and awareness of other people's world. 5. Learn Latin - change comes through action not intention. Overcome the tendency to put things off. 6. Ditch Doris Day - create your own future rather than leave it to chance. Forget the attitude 'que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be.'""A superb book.

Paul Muldoon,Moy Sand and Gravel,,English,,"Paul Muldoon's ninth collection of poems, his first since Hay (1998), finds him working a rich vein that extends from the rivery, apple-heavy County Armagh of the 1950s, in which he was brought up, to suburban New Jersey, on the banks of a canal dug by Irish navvies, where he now lives. Grounded, glistening, as gritty as they are graceful, these poems seem capable of taking in almost anything, and anybody, be it a Tuareg glimpsed on the Irish border, Bessie Smith, Marilyn Monroe, Queen Elizabeth I, a hunted hare, William Tell, William Butler Yeats, Sitting Bull, Ted Hughes, an otter, a fox, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Joscelyne, un unearthed pit pony, a loaf of bread, an outhouse, a killdeer, Oscar Wilde, or a flock of redknots. At the heart of the book is an elegy for a miscarried child, and that elegiac tone predominates, particularly in the elegant remaking of Yeats's ""A Prayer for My Daughter"" with which the book concludes, where a welter of traffic signs and slogans, along with the spirits of admen, hardware storekeepers, flimflammers, fixers, and other forebears, are borne along by a hurricane-swollen canal, and private grief coincides with some of the gravest matter of our age.Moy Sand and Gravel is the winner of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.",,,10/17/02,April 15th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Ireland']",,9780374528843,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316130449l/131036.jpg,3.68,"['Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (2003)', 'T.S.

Paul O'Grady,At My Mother's Knee...: and other low joints,,English,,"In his own uniquely acid tongue, Paul O'Grady traces the hilarious tales of life in Irish Catholic Birkenhead that took him from a virtuous altar-boy (""my first drag"") to Britain's best loved entertainer. It's a life that includes, varyingly, stints in an abbatoir, as a social worker, in a high-class Mayfair brothel, and traipsing down to London to chase his dreams. By 23, Paul O'Grady had been a father, husband, drag queen, gay lover, divorcee, and degenerate. He did it all with a smile on his face, making a mental note to register the whip-smart one-liners that would later inform his star-studded path from the fringes of comedy to the heart of the British establishment, first as his own brilliant comic creation Lily Savage, then, triumphantly, as himself. Paul's remarkable childhood and early life is littered with a dizzying cast-list of rogues, rascals, lovers, fighters, saints, and sinners. Oh, and one iconic bus conductress. Told with pathos, love, empathy, and naturally, biting humor, the story of Paul O'Grady is that of everyman, everywoman, and inevitably, every drag act ever. He has been rich and poor, posh and common, straight and gay. He has mixed with stars and whores and all that's in between, slyly spotting the similarity between them all.

Paul O'Grady,The Devil Rides Out,,English,,"Birkenhead, 1973. The eighteen-year-old Paul O'Grady gets ready for a big Saturday night out on the town. New white T-shirt, freshly ironed jeans, looking good. As he bids farewell to his mum, who's on the phone to his auntie, and wanders off down the street in a cloud of aftershave, he hears her familiar cry: 'Oh, the devil rides out tonight, Annie. The Devil rides out!'The further adventures of Paul O'Grady - following on from the million-copy-selling At My Mother's Knee - are, if anything, even more hilarious and outrageous than what has come before. As Paul struggles to get to grips with unexpected fatherhood and bereavement, he searches high and low for a job that lasts and somehow finds himself getting married in the process. Work takes him from an abattoir to a children's home, from a hospital to a nightclub, and from penthouse to pavement. Along the way, he takes his first-Savage steps on stage, tastes the exotic delights of Manila and invades Poland . . .To say that The Devil Rides Out is action-packed is an understatement. Its extraordinary cast of characters includes lords and ladies, the legendary Vera, a serial killer, more prostitutes than you can shake a stick at and drag queens of every shape and size.

Paul O. Zelinsky (retold by),Rapunzel,,English,,"Surely among the most original and gifted of children's book illustrators, Paul O. Zelinsky has once again with unmatched emotional authority, control of space, and narrativecapability brought forth a unique vision for an age-old tale. Few artists at work today can touch the level at which his paintings tell a story and exert their hold.Zelinsky's retelling of Rapunzel reaches back beyond the Grimms to a late-seventeenth-century French tale by Mlle. la Force, who based hers on the Neapolitan tale Petrosinella in a collection popular at the time. The artist understands the story's fundamentals to be about possessiveness, confinement, and separation, rather than about punishment and deprivation. Thus the tower the sorceress gives Rapunzel here is not a desolate, barren structure of denial but one of esoteric beauty on the outside and physical luxury within. And the world the artist creates through the elements in his paintings the palette, control of light, landscape, characters, architecture,interiors, costumes speaks to us not of an ugly witch who cruelly imprisons a beautiful young girl, but of a mother figure who powerfully resists her child's inevitable growth, and of a young woman and man who must struggle in the wilderness for the self-reliance that is the true beginningof their adulthood.As ever, and yet always somehow in newly arresting fashion, Paul O.

Paul Pitchford,Healing With Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition,,English,,"Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, this is a hefty, truly comprehensive guide to the theory and healing power of Chinese medicine. It's also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen). There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss.

Paul R.

In the clear, readable, entertaining style that brought acclaim for his best-selling Age of Diminished Expectations, Krugman explains what real economic analysis is. He discusses economic terms and measurements, like ""value-added"" and GDP, in simple language so that readers can understand how pop internationalists distort, and sometimes contradict, the most basic truths about world trade. All but two of the essays have previously appeared in such publications as Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, and the Harvard Business Review. The first five essays take on exaggerations of foreign competition's effects on the U.S. economy and represent Krugman's central criticisms of public debate over world trade. The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom. The third group of essays highlights misconceptions about competition from less industrialized countries.

He traces how development theory lost its huge initial influence andvirtually disappeared from economic discourse after it became clear that many of the theory's maininsights could not be clearly modeled.

Confronting killers with a combination of diplomacy, flattery, and deception, he offered shelter to more than twelve thousand members of the Tutsi clan and Hutu moderates, while homicidal mobs raged outside with machetes.An Ordinary Man explores what the Academy Award-nominated film Hotel Rwanda could not: the inner life of the man who became one of the most prominent public faces of that terrible conflict. Rusesabagina tells for the first time the full story of his life - growing up as the son of a rural farmer, the child of a mixed marriage, his extraordinary career path which led him to become the first Rwandan manager of the Belgian-owned Hotel Milles Collines - all of which contributed to his heroic actions in the face of such horror. He will also bring the reader inside the hotel for those one hundred terrible days depicted in the film, relating the anguish of those who watched as their loved ones were hacked to pieces and the betrayal that he felt as a result of the UN’s refusal to help at this time of crisis.Including never-before-reported details of the Rwandan genocide, An Ordinary Man is sure to become a classic of tolerance literature, joining such books as Thomas Keneally’s Schindler’s List, Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom, and Elie Wiesel’s Night.

Still, the history of the Sith Order is one of duplicity, betrayal, and acolytes violently usurping their Masters—and the truest measure of Vader's allegiance has yet to be taken. Until now. On Ryloth, a planet crucial to the growing Empire as a source of slave labor and the narcotic known as ""spice,"" an aggressive resistance movement has arisen, led by Cham Syndulla, an idealistic freedom fighter, and Isval, a vengeful former slave. But Emperor Palpatine means to control the embattled world and its precious resources—by political power or firepower—and he will be neither intimidated nor denied. Accompanied by his merciless disciple, Darth Vader, he sets out on a rare personal mission to ensure that his will is done. For Syndulla and Isval, it's the opportunity to strike at the very heart of the ruthless dictatorship sweeping the galaxy.

Paul Stamets,Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World,,English,,"Mycelium Running is a manual for the mycological rescue of the planet. That’s right: growing more mushrooms may be the best thing we can do to save the environment, and in this groundbreaking text from mushroom expert Paul Stamets, you’ll find out how. The basic science goes like this: Microscopic cells called “mycelium”--the fruit of which are mushrooms--recycle carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements as they break down plant and animal debris in the creation of rich new soil. What Stamets has discovered is that we can capitalize on mycelium’s digestive power and target it to decompose toxic wastes and pollutants (mycoremediation), catch and reduce silt from streambeds and pathogens from agricultural watersheds (mycofiltration), control insect populations (mycopesticides), and generally enhance the health of our forests and gardens (mycoforestry and myco-gardening).  In this comprehensive guide, you’ll find chapters detailing each of these four exciting branches of what Stamets has coined “mycorestoration,” as well as chapters on the medicinal and nutritional properties of mushrooms, inoculation methods, log and stump culture, and species selection for various environmental purposes.

It gives man much to think about, that he has a way to receive and give certain knowledge about one's self which is useful and valuable. Life is largely a struggle in which man employs the known in an effort to conquer the unknown. Everywhere people are endeavoring to predict the future for meeting it in a more prepared manner. The whole story of the ECK-Vidya is the penetration into the realms of the generally unknown areas, not yet explored by the psychics, scientists, mystics or saints. The ECK-Vidya involves the principle of the cycles of life. It is up to the individula to learn these subtle changes and to make the adjustment as they arise. The minor changes always affect the greater changes. So when one is able to recognize and handle the very smaller cycles within himself, then he is able to bring about control over his life in the inner which controls his whole universe, that which he carries with himself at all times. ECKANKAR, of itself, is the highest path to God. But in its own broad and comprehensive aspects are included thirty or more facets or spiritual works, such as prophecy, healing, self-realization, the deja-vu powers, siddhi (spiritual knowledge), omnipresence, making events happen for one's own future, to name a few. All these are carried on upon a higher spiritual level than those of the occult, metaphysical and religious teachings. The vibrations of anyone practicing the ECK-Vidya are so high that those on the lower psychic scale can never be compared with them.",,,06/30/27,July 1st 1997,[],Paperback,[],,9781570430305,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1392028343l/79513.jpg,4.22,[],96.0,1.0,,79513.The_Eck_Vidya,,,,,88.0,85.0,214,,Eckankar,"['50', '16', '9', '8', '2']",,,[],,

Readers wanting to make happiness happen for themselves or those around them will gain insight into being happier - and being happy more often.Happiness, emotions and positive psychology are abstract concepts that are generally difficult to explain and understand.Adopting a unique approach, Lucky Go Happy unpacks these abstract concepts using the odd elementary graph and image, which when conveyed to readers through a fable makes for an informative and entertaining read for young and old.Lucky Go Happy follows the adventures of Lucky the Rat who has been sent into the African Bush by King Lion, to discover what makes other animals happy.Through various encounters with remarkable characters, Lucky captures some reviving new takes on happiness which he has to present to King Lion in a report before the next rainy season. King Lion hopes to regain his own happiness after reading the report.Lucky Go Happy will:- demonstrate how we lose more than 70 percent of potential happy time by living for weekends only- explain how contentment can yield the same amount of happiness as ecstasy- provide concrete proof that money can never - and will never - make us happy- highlight why it is absolutely essential to be unhappy at times-- illustrate why a midlife crisis happens- show that happiness is not around the next corner; it is here and now,- andhelp you understand how happiness works.Rather than waiting for happiness, you can make it happen for yourself and for those around you!Visit www.luckygohappybook.com",,,,October 21st 2014,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction']",,9781496941640,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415017840l/23494381.jpg,4.36,[],600.0,6.0,,23494381-lucky-go-happy,,,,,96.0,75.0,108,,Authorhouse,"['41', '24', '7', '2', '1']",,,[],,

"Paul Williams, Michael Lydon",Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music,,English,,"As founder and editor of Crawdaddy! magazine, Paul Williams has helped the rock music field itself, as well as outsiders, to recognize the importance of rock as a modern music and as a facet of modern experience. In Outlaw Blues, his first book, the author presents his own experience of rock music, the history of his reactions and insights over a two-year period. For a critic to offer something true to his readers, he must be more than an appraiser. He must be a listener, deeply and passionately involved in the experience he describes, a lover rather than an observer. Outlaw Blues is a book full of feeling, a guide to one man's musical experience that is intended to bring all its readers closer to the nature of their own relationship with music, with the joy that bursts from the transistor radios and the open doors of the concert halls. The author says: ""I see rock as a means of expression, an opportunity for beauty, an art. So what I have written is expression, not explanation; an attempt to convey what I feel from the music, an exploration of what rock does to me."" Paul Williams offers us in Outlaw Blues the same warmth and honesty of style, the same acute sensitivity and insight into the workings of contemporary music, that have made him the most respected writer in his field--admired as much by the men he writes about as the listeners he writes for.

Paul Wilton,Beginning JavaScript,,English,,"JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to enhance static web applications by providing dynamic, personalized, and interactive content. This improves the experience of visitors to your site and makes it more likely that they will visit again. You must have seen the flashy drop-down menus, moving text, and changing content that are now widespread on web sites—they are enabled through JavaScript. Supported by all the major browsers, JavaScript is the language of choice on the Web. It can even be used outside web applications—to automate administrative tasks, for example.This book aims to teach you all you need to know to start experimenting with JavaScript: what it is, how it works, and what you can do with it. Starting from the basic syntax, you'll move on to learn how to create powerful web applications. Don't worry if you've never programmed before—this book will teach you all you need to know, step by step. You'll find that JavaScript can be a great introduction to the world of programming: with the knowledge and understanding that you'll gain from this book, you'll be able to move on to learn newer and more advanced technologies in the world of computing.In order to get the most out of this book, you'll need to have an understanding of HTML and how to create a static web page. You don't need to have any programming experience.This book will also suit you if you have some programming experience already, and would like to turn your hand to web programming. You will know a fair amount about computing concepts, but maybe not as much about web technologies.Alternatively, you may have a design background and know relatively little about the Web and computing concepts. For you, JavaScript will be a cheap and relatively easy introduction to the world of programming and web application development.Whoever you are, we hope that this book lives up to your expectations.You'll begin by looking at exactly what JavaScript is, and taking your first steps with the underlying language and syntax. You'll learn all the fundamental programming concepts, including data and data types, and structuring your code to make decisions in your programs or to loop over the same piece of code many times.Once you're comfortable with the basics, you'll move on to one of the key ideas in JavaScript—the object. You'll learn how to take advantage of the objects that are native to the JavaScript language, such as dates and strings, and find out how these objects enable you to manage complex data and simplify your programs. Next, you'll see how you can use JavaScript to manipulate objects made available to you in the browser, such as forms, windows, and other controls. Using this knowledge, you can start to create truly professional-looking applications that enable you to interact with the user.Long pieces of code are very hard to get right every time—even for the experienced programmer—and JavaScript code is no exception. You look at common syntax and logical errors, how you can spot them, and how to use the Microsoft Script Debugger to aid you with this task. Also, you need to examine how to handle the errors that slip through the net, and ensure that these do not detract from the experience of the end user of your application.From here, you'll move on to more advanced topics, such as using cookies and jazzing up your web pages with dynamic HTML and XML. Finally, you'll be looking at a relatively new and exciting technology, remote scripting. This allows your JavaScript in a HTML page to communicate directly with a server, and useful for, say, looking up information on a database sitting on your server. If you have the Google toolbar you'll have seen something like this in action already. When you type a search word in the Google toolbar, it comes up with suggestions, which it gets via the Google search database.All the new concepts introduced in this book will be illustrated with practical examples, which enable you to experiment with JavaScript and build on the theory that you have just learned. The appendix provides solutions to the exercises included at the end of most chapters throughout the book.During the first half of the book, you'll also be building up a more complex sample application—an online trivia quiz—which will show you how JavaScript is used in action in a real-world situation.",,Second Edition,12/01/00,May 7th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Programming', 'Reference', 'Technology', 'Nonfiction', 'Technical']",,9780764555879,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1178912846l/852922._SX318_.jpg,3.48,[],99.0,1.0,,852922.Beginning_JavaScript,,,,,88.0,83.0,1010,,Wrox Press,"['11', '29', '33', '9', '1']",,,[],,

Paul de Kruif,Microbe Hunters,,English,,"“It manages to delight, and frequently to entrance, old and new readers [and] continues to engage our hearts and minds today with an indescribably brand of affectionate sympathy.”—F. Gonzalez-Crussi, from the Introduction An international bestseller, translated into eighteen languages, Paul de Kruif’s classic account of the first scientists to see and learn about the microscopic world continues to fascinate new readers. This is a timeless dramatization of the scientists, bacteriologists, doctors, and medical technicians who discovered the microbes and invented the vaccines to counter them. De Kruif writes about how seemingly simple but really fundamental discovers of science—for instance, how a microbe was first viewed in a clear drop of rain water, and when, for the first time, Louis Pasteur discovered that a simple vaccine could save a man from the ravages of rabies by attacking the microbes that cause it.  ",,,10/30/26,October 28th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Medicine', 'Biology', 'Biography', 'Medical', 'Health', 'School', 'Disease']",,9780156027779,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434084164l/582171._SY475_.jpg,4.12,[],100.0,1.0,,582171.Microbe_Hunters,,,,,94.0,2932.0,384,,Mariner Books,"['1236', '1020', '512', '121', '43']",,,['United Kingdom'],,

What she found instead was shocking: She had an identical twin sister. What’s more, after being separated as infants, she and her sister had been, for a time, part of a secret study on separated twins.Paula Bernstein, a married writer and mother living in New York, also knew she was adopted, but had no inclination to find her birth mother. When she answered a call from her adoption agency one spring afternoon, Paula’s life suddenly divided into two starkly different periods: the time before and the time after she learned the truth.

Paula Brackston (Goodreads Author),The Witch's Daughter,,English,,"My name is Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith, and my age is three hundred and eighty-four years. Each new settlement asks for a new journal, and so this Book of Shadows begins.In the spring of 1628, the Witchfinder of Wessex finds himself a true Witch. As Bess Hawksmith watches her mother swing from the Hanging Tree she knows that only one man can save her from the same fate at the hands of the panicked mob: the Warlock Gideon Masters, and his Book of Shadows. Secluded at his cottage in the woods, Gideon instructs Bess in the Craft, awakening formidable powers she didn't know she had and making her immortal. She couldn't have foreseen that even now, centuries later, he would be hunting her across time, determined to claim payment for saving her life.In present-day England, Elizabeth has built a quiet life for herself, tending her garden and selling herbs and oils at the local farmers' market. But her solitude abruptly ends when a teenage girl called Tegan starts hanging around. Against her better judgment, Elizabeth begins teaching Tegan the ways of the Hedge Witch, in the process awakening memories—and demons—long thought forgotten.Part historical romance, part modern fantasy, The Witch’s Daughter is a fresh, compelling take on the magical, yet dangerous world of Witches.

Paula Brackston (Goodreads Author),The Silver Witch,,English,,"A year after her husband’s sudden death, ceramic artist Tilda Fordwells finally moves into the secluded Welsh cottage that was to be their new home. She hopes that the tranquil surroundings will help ease her grief, and lessen her disturbing visions of Mat’s death. Instead, the lake in the valley below her cottage seems to spark something dormant in her – a sensitivity, and a power of some sort. Animals are drawn to her, electricity shorts out when she’s near, and strangest of all, she sees a new vision; a boatful of ancient people approaching her across the water. On this same lake in Celtic times lived Seren, a witch and shaman. She was respected but feared, kept separate from the community for her strange looks. When a vision came to her of the Prince amid a nest of vipers she warned of betrayal from one of his own. Prince Brynach both loved and revered her, but could not believe someone close to him wished him harm, even as the danger grew. In her own time, Tilda’s grief begins to fade beside her newfound powers and a fresh love. When she explores the lake’s ancient magic and her own she discovers Seren, the woman in her vision of the boat. Their two lives strangely mirror each others, suggesting a strong connection between the women. As Tilda comes under threat from a dark power, one reminiscent of Seren’s prophecy, she must rely on Seren and ancient magic if death and disaster are not to shatter her life once more.",Shadow Chronicles,,,April 21st 2015,"['Tilda', 'Seren']",Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Witches', 'Paranormal', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Magical Realism']",,9781250028792,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404618593l/21853637.jpg,3.82,[],45.0,1.0,,21853637-the-silver-witch,,,,,92.0,5583.0,308,,Thomas Dunne Books,"['1427', '2230', '1501', '343', '82']",,,['Wales'],,

Paula McLain (Goodreads Author),The Paris Wife,,English,,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley. Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.",,,,February 27th 2011,"['F.

Si la narradora dice haber tenido el lapsus de decir «vuelo» en lugar de «duelo», debería reconocer en ese lapsus una verdad profunda: el vuelo hacia la escritura como suplemento soberano del dolor; y que entre la madre narrada y la hija, ambas pertenecientes a mundos opuestos, existe el legado de una autonomía orgullosa, esa que hace siempre de una vida algo completo y pleno.El duelo suele ser más largo que su relato: 'Carta a mi madre' de George Simenon, 'Una muerte muy dulce' de Simone de Beauvoir y 'Desgracia indeseada' de Peter Handke son nouvelles, como si el relato de la muerte materna exigiera cierta síntesis ascética en el estilo, cierto laconismo en la pena. 'Las estrellas' se merece formar parte de esa serie entrañable».",,1ª,,January 29th 2020,[],Paperback,[],,9788494909573,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1580511048l/50747923._SY475_.jpg,4.0,[],90.0,1.0,,50747923-las-estrellas,,,,,95.0,129.0,150,,Editorial Tránsito,"['40', '55', '28', '6', '0']",,,[],,

Jobless and ashamed, he takes them into a stranger’s house, a place that will become the site of the greatest humiliation of his life. In an impoverished fishing town, four teenage boys try to allay their boredom during an endless summer by translating lyrics from the Smiths into Spanish using a stolen dictionary. Their dreams of fame and glory twist into a plan to steal musical instruments from a church, an obsession that prevents one of them from anticipating a devastating ending. Meanwhile a young woman goes home with a charismatic man after finding his daughter wandering lost in a public place. She soon discovers, like so many characters in this book, that fortuitous encounters can be deceptions in disguise.Themes of pride, shame, and disgrace—small and large, personal and public—tie the stories in this collection together.

When orphaned Daiyu leaves her home in the provinces to take shelter with her cousins in the Capital, she is drawn into a world of opulent splendor, presided over by the ruthless, scheming Xifeng and the prim, repressed Baochai.

Pauline Reage,The Illustrated Story Of O,,,Photography,"""...I was convinced that Story of O was going to revolutionize the book trade, that I would sell hundreds of thousands of copies across the world, and that moral attitudes would change overnight. The audacity of this novel seemed to me to be liberating rather than provocative. I perceived the promise of a new freedom. And I expected to cause a shock.""--Jean-Jacques Pauvert, from the Introduction When Story of O was first published in 1954 in Paris by Jean-Jacques Pauvert, it narrowly escaped censorship by the Department of the Interior and eventually became the most widely translated French novel in the world. It describes in cool, elegant language the experiences of a young woman as she willingly enters a dark maze of perverse sexual practices within a clandestine amoral society. Revelling in pure fantasy, its theme is total submission through love to excesses of sadism and masochism, and the bond of ""ownership."" Now Doris Kloster, a photographer specializing in issues of women's sexuality and power, has realized a long-standing dream. She has created a photographic representation of one of the most famous and controversial erotic novels ever published. The result is another sensation. The Illustrated Story of O presents over 50 superb images which mirror perfectly the intense eroticism of the novel. Shooting entirely in Paris and its environs, Doris Kloster has succeeded in matching characters, locations, costumes and props to the original descriptions. And each magnificent color photograph is accompanied by a short extract from the novel. In addition, there is a Preface from Doris Kloster herself and an Introduction from Jean-Jacques Pauvert, the original publisher of the novel. The Illustrated Story of O presents a rich visual feast that will delight fans of Doris Kloster's work, and appeal strongly to connoisseurs of the darker excesses of sexuality.

"Paulo Coelho (Goodreads Author), Margaret Jull Costa (Translator), Kâmuran Şipal (Translator)",Veronika Decides to Die,,English,,"In his latest international bestseller, the celebrated author of The Alchemist addresses the fundamental questions asked by millions: What am I doing here today? and Why do I go on living?Twenty-four-year-old Veronika seems to have everything she could wish for: youth and beauty, plenty of attractive boyfriends, a fulfilling job, and a loving family. Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.In Veronika Decides to Die, Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.",On the Seventh Day #2,,10/28/98,06/01/06,"['Boston ""Mari"" Maribu', 'Athena (Greek goddess)', 'Veronika', 'Eduard', 'Dr. Igor', 'Zedka']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Philosophy', 'Novels', 'Psychology', 'Romance', 'Drama', 'Mental Health', 'Literature', 'Spirituality']",,9780061124266,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348139939l/1431.jpg,3.7,[],11482.0,142.0,,1431.Veronika_Decides_to_Die,,,,,87.0,174383.0,210,,Harper Perennial,"['47198', '58406', '45767', '16113', '6899']",,,['Ljubljana (Slovenia)'],,

Rewrite your destiny.In his most personal novel to date, internationally bestselling author Paulo Coelho returns with a remarkable journey of self-discovery. Like the main character in his much-beloved The Alchemist, Paulo is facing a grave crisis of faith. As he seeks a path of spiritual renewal and growth, his only real option is to begin again—to travel, to experiment, to reconnect with people and the landscapes around him.Setting off to Africa, and then to Europe and Asia via the Trans-Siberian railroad, he initiates a journey to revitalize his energy and passion. Even so, he never expects to meet Hilal. A gifted young violinist, she is the woman Paulo loved five hundred years before—and the woman he betrayed in an act of cowardice so far-reaching that it prevents him from finding real happiness in this life. Together they will initiate a mystical voyage through time and space, traveling a path that teaches love, forgiveness, and the courage to overcome life’s inevitable challenges. Beautiful and inspiring, Aleph invites us to consider the meaning of our own personal journeys.",,,10/28/10,"The Best of Paulo Coelho

Pearl Cleage,I Wish I Had a Red Dress,,English,,"Cleage captures the mores, culture, and rhythm of black urban youth and the romantic tensions between mature black adults as she weaves contemporary issues into a love story.Joyce Mitchell was widowed far too young when her beloved husband, Mitch, died in a tragic accident five years ago. Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call ""twenty-first-century free women."" All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mall and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard to define work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities. Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, ""if you want to make God laugh, make plans."" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress...",Idlewild #2,,07/01/01,July 9th 2002,[],Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'African American', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'African American Literature', 'Womens', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Feminism', 'Romance']",,9780380804887,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442876071l/771493._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],97.0,1.0,,771493.I_Wish_I_Had_a_Red_Dress,,,,,95.0,3157.0,323,,HarperCollins Publishers,"['1278', '1105', '622', '122', '30']",,,[],,

Centering her story around the fictional family of Ling Tan, Buck recreates the heart wrenching devastation that war inflicted on these gentle innocent people. Ling Tan and his family were simple farmers living in peaceful isolation. Western technology, and likewise the machinery of war, were unknown in these outlying regions of China. And even though literacy was on the rise among the younger generations, the alarming reports of foreign aggression went largely ignored. For the peasants, the transition from one political ruler to another was virtually inconsequential; life revolved around their farms and their villages. Patriotism was not the concept of loving and defending a country; their land was their country. But as the invasion moves inland and the roads are jammed with survivors fleeing west, Ling Tan and his neighbors are forced to face the harsh realities of war. ""Days passed and with the rulers gone the people held themselves the more steadfast knowing that they and they alone were left to stand against the enemy and upon each man himself now depended what would happen. So it had happened again and again in other times, for rulers anywhere are always the first to fly, and the people must stay behind to be steadfast.",,,11/06/41,September 1st 1997,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'China', 'Classics', 'Asia', 'War', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Novels']",,9783473520831,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180824338l/1080768.jpg,4.08,[],55.0,1.0,,1080768.Der_Drachenfisch_Ab_8_J_,,,,,96.0,2528.0,96,,Ravensburger Buchverlag,"['915', '1026', '493', '74', '20']",,,[],,

Tú debes de pensar que todo esto es una locura, y yo, simplemente, ya no sé qué pensar... ¿Cómo lo ves?».Simón Varela, arquitecto, es un reputado especialista en construcción de gallineros, chiringuitos de playa y otras chapuzas por el estilo. Su fina ironía y su instinto para sobrevivir son sus dos puntos fuertes. Por eso, un encargo de restauración en la finca de una de las familias más poderosas –y turbias– de Vigo le resulta tan sorprendente como alarmante. Sin embargo, la revelación de un inesperado secreto familiar que le incumbe y la belleza adictiva de una mujer a la que no quiere renunciar le impulsan a quedarse y a afrontar la situación como lo haría un personaje de Raymond Chandler, pero en versión gallega y ciertamente poco glamurosa.El debut de Pedro Feijoo en la narrativa no puede ser mejor, como confirma su rotundo éxito en Galicia.

"Pedro Juan Gutiérrez, Natasha Wimmer",Dirty Havana Trilogy,,English,,"For the last four decades, Fidel Castro's communist Cuba has survived a harsh economic blockade. In 1993, Castro attempted economic reform by allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars and begin their own business ventures—""a huge messy free-for-all."" This time of confused, low-rent capitalism is the backdrop for Pedro Juan Gutierrez's gritty, powerful, and atmospheric novel-in-stories, Dirty Havana Trilogy, translated from the original Spanish version by Natasha Wimmer.Gutierrez, whose prose sings of grime and simple, hard-clay truths, much like the words of Junot Díaz, is a well-known member of the Latin American visual poetry movement and a magazine journalist living in Havana. Dirty Havana Trilogy is written from the semiautobiographical point of view of Pedro Juan, a 40-year-old sex-starved ex-radio journalist cobbling together an existence by selling everything from himself to drugs to whatever he can get his hands on. ""Everything's worth something here,"" he writes.Pedro Juan is an ex-radio journalist because in a ""model"" communist society nothing bad is acceptable news. Through his tormented lead character, Gutierrez provides a window into his reasons for writing such a crude book. ""That's why I was disillusioned with journalism and why I started to write raw stories.... I write to jar people a little and force others to wake up and smell the shit.... That's how I terrorize cowards and mess with people who like to muzzle those of us who speak up.... My stories could run bare-assed out into the middle of the street, shouting, 'Freedom, freedom, freedom.'""That said, be warned: Dirty Havana Trilogy is not for the faint of heart. It is raw, squarely confronting poverty, racism, violence, prostitution, and the lengths Cubans go to in order to secure the almighty buck. In one story, the man who lives across the hall from Pedro Juan, in the crumbling apartment building that serves as the focal point for much of the book, is busted by the cops for stealing human livers from the morgue and selling them on the streets as pork livers.But survival isn't the only thing on the minds of Gutierrez's colorful characters. Oddly enough, it's the quest for release, for fits of pleasure, for some sliver of happiness no matter how warped the avenue may seem to the world outside Havana. And that quest is manifested in the hard-core sex that permeates the pages of the book. An orgasm is one of the few pleasures no one can be denied. As violent and nauseating as the sex -- and the life -- may seem on the surface, Gutierrez achieves the difficult task of lifting his characters from the muck, giving his Dirty Havana Trilogy an intellectual and emotional depth that far outweighs the carnal.Near the end Gutierrez writes, ""Born in the ruins, they just kept trying not to give up or let themselves be beaten so severely that at last they were forced to surrender. Anything was possible, everything allowed, except defeat."" The book then becomes a manifesto, a well-wrought fight against literary persecution, a release the same as an orgasm, where the truth behind every dark corner, behind every door, must be told. Dirty Havana Trilogy comes from the same womb in which literature was born, a book that just may someday be held up beside those of the mighty dead.Nelson Taylor is a freelance writer and author of the travel guide America Bizarro, published by St. Martin's Press.",,,10/29/94,February 5th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Spanish Literature', 'Novels', 'Sexuality', 'Latin American Literature', '20th Century', 'Contemporary']",,9780060006891,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348601905l/298537.jpg,3.76,[],197.0,2.0,,298537.Dirty_Havana_Trilogy,,,,,89.0,3438.0,392,,Ecco,"['955', '1195', '896', '296', '96']",,,['Havana (Cuba)'],,

Somewhere between the exhilarating rise of Girl Power in the 1990s and today, the pursuit of physical perfection has been recast as the source of female empowerment. And commercialization has spread the message faster and farther, reaching girls at ever-younger ages. But how dangerous is pink and pretty, anyway? Being a princess is just make-believe; eventually they grow out of it . . . or do they?In search of answers, Peggy Orenstein visited Disneyland, trolled American Girl Place, and met parents of beauty-pageant preschoolers tricked out like Vegas showgirls.

"Penelope Delta, Πηνελόπη Δέλτα",Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα,,"Greek, Modern (1453-)",,"Το ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" γράφτηκε σε μια εποχή πολιτικά ταραγμένη για την Ελλάδα. Η ήττα του 1897 ήταν ακόμα νωπή, το καθεστώς ασταθές, άνθιζε η διαφθορά, η εκπαίδευση δεν ανταποκρινόταν στις ευρωπαϊκές αντιλήψεις περί παιδαγωγικής. Από την άλλη, το γλωσσικό ζήτημα έκαιγε. Ο Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος, του οποίου ήταν μέλος και η Δέλτα, συσπείρωνε διανοούμενους, όπως λογοτέχνες (Βάρναλης, Καζαντζάκης, Νιρβάνας), εκπαιδευτικούς και παιδαγωγούς (Γληνός, Δελμούζος) φιλολόγους (Σαρής, Τριανταφυλλίδης), με στόχο μεταρρυθμίσεις που αφορούσαν στην εισαγωγή της δημοτικής γλώσσας στην εκπαίδευση και στην εξάπλωση νέων ιδεών για την ανατροφή των παιδιών.ΜΑΡΙΖΑ ΝΤΕΚΑΣΤΡΟΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" είναι ένα πολιτικό παραμύθι, είναι μια πλατωνική Πολιτεία για παιδιά, είναι η ιστορία μιας παραμυθένιας πατρίδας... Της Ελλάδας.Η Πηνελόπη Δ. είναι πιστή, όπως τ' όνομά της, στις ιδέες της μέσα στο βιβλίο, πιστή μέχρι το θάνατο σ'όλα όσα επέλεξε να ξεχάσει και σ' αυτά που τόσο μεθοδικά προτείνει.Τα ονόματα των πρωταγωνιστών τούς ανήκουν εκ φύσεως και διηγούνται κι από μόνα τους την ιστορία. Ο καλός βασιλιάς, που μετρήθηκαν οι μέρες του, λέγεται Συνετός, και μετά αρχίζει η βασιλεία του Αστόχαστου και της Παλάβως στη Χώρα των Μοιρολάτρων. Μέχρι που, από τη γειτονική χώρα, φτάνει, αντί για οικονομική βοήθεια, η ύστατη προσβολή: μια γαϊδουροκεφαλή με τενεκεδένιο στέμμα.Κι εδώ ακριβώς αρχίζει το παραμύθι για τα απογοητευμένα μάτια μας. Ο γιος του Αστόχαστου λέγεται Συνετός Β΄ και αρκεί να πούμε ότι στο τέλος θα παντρευτεί τη Γνώση, κόρη της Φρόνησης, λες κι έχει πάρει το αξίωμά του κατευθείαν από τον Σωκράτη.Ξαναδιαβάζοντας το βιβλίο, ένας μεγάλος θα νιώσει ίσως αμήχανα στις μέρες μας, αντιμέτωπος μ'αυτή την ελπίδα που δεν διαψεύδεται και με την αρετή που ξαναχτίζει τον κόσμο - χωρίς καθόλου μαγικά ξόρκια ή δανεικά κονδύλια, αλλά χάρη σε πολύ σκληρή δουλειά για το κοινό καλό. Γιατί ένας μεγάλος αυτόματα θα μετρήσει την απόσταση ανάμεσα σ' αυτά που επέλεξε να υποτιμήσει και να ξεχάσει και στα τόσα που μεθοδικά προτείνει το βιβλίο. Γιατί η Πηνελόπη Δ. έχει προβλέψει ακόμα και για τη σωστή εκμετάλλευση της φύσης, έχει σκεφτεί ακόμα και τους φυλακισμένους να ξανακάνει ανθρώπους μέσα από την πιο σκληρή, είναι η αλήθεια, δουλειά των λατομείων. Και παρόλο που δεν ξεφεύγει από την παρουσία μιας ελέω Θεού βασιλικής οικογένειας, το βασιλόπουλο είναι τόσο ταπεινό, εργατικό και ενάρετο που θα μπορούσε να είναι ένας αυτοδημιούργητος λαϊκός ήρωας.ΜΑΡΙΑ ΜΗΤΣΟΡΑΗ Πηνελόπη Δέλτα φώτισε τα παιδικά μας χρόνια, τα κατοίκησε και τα ενθάρρυνε δίνοντας ""όνομα"" -και μια σπάνια αύρα- στα ανείπωτα της ψυχής.

"Penny Le Couteur, Jay Burreson",Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History,,English,,"Though many factors have been proposed to explain the failure of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign, it has also been linked to something as small as a button - a tin button, the kind that fastened everything from the greatcoats of Napoleon's officers to the trousers of his foot soldiers. When temperatures drop below 56°F, tin crumbles into powder. Were the soldiers of the Grande Armée acutee fatally weakened by cold because the buttons of their uniforms fell apart? How different our world might be if tin did not disintegrate at low temperatures and the French had continued their eastward expansion!  This fascinating book tells the stories of seventeen molecules that, like the tin of those buttons, greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration and made possible the ensuing voyages of discovery. They resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine; lie behind changes in gender roles, in law, and in the environment; and have determined what we today eat, drink, and wear.  Showing how a change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous differences in the properties of a substance, the authors reveal the astonishing chemical connections among seemingly unrelated events. Napoleon's Buttons offers a novel way to understand how our contemporary world works and how our civilization has been shaped over time.",,,January 1st 1991,April 28th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Chemistry', 'Popular Science', 'History Of Science', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'School', 'Science Nature']",,9781585422203,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203185l/141624.jpg,3.96,[],24.0,1.0,,141624.Napoleon_s_Buttons,,,,,94.0,5036.0,375,,Tarcher,"['1575', '2045', '1119', '231', '66']",,,[],,

Martha, Clio, and Jocasta meet by chance at Heathrow airport in 1985 as they are starting off on separate backpacking adventures, and they decide to spend the first few days of their trips together in Thailand. When they go their separate ways, they vow to get together in London the following year.

Penny Vincenzi,An Absolute Scandal,,English,,"Penny Vincenzi, master of the contemporary blockbuster, returns with a moving, engaging portrait of people coping with a notorious financial disaster and its unpredictable emotional repercussions. Set during the boom-and-bust years of the 1980s, An Absolute Scandal follows the lives of a group of people drawn together by their mutual monetary woes when the great financial institution Lloyd's undergoes a devastating downturn. For Nigel Cowper, this means the destruction of his family business; his wife, Lucinda, is willing to do everything she can to help him—except give up her irresistible lover. The powerful, charismatic banker Simon Beaumont and his wife, a highly successful advertising executive, lose everything they worked so hard to acquire; but the ultimate tragedy is something that neither one could have anticipated. The well-to-do are not the only ones suffering: a self-sufficient widow is suddenly deep in debt; a single mother struggles to maintain a comfortable home for her children; and a schoolmaster and his frustrated wife find that financial problems deepen the cracks in their troubled marriage. As their lives begin a downward spiral, these characters intersect in ways they never saw coming. Written in what has become her signature style of both wit and candor, Penny Vincenzi draws back the curtain and offers an inside view of the greed and social power plays that occur behind the closed doors of upper-crust society . . . where money isn’t everything.

Bad boy extraordinaire, he's arrogant, rude, undeniably gorgeous and shares a past with Clara that she wants to do nothing more than to forget.Caught between two boys, her life is turned upside down in the most ridiculous of ways.

Percival Everett,Erasure,,English,,"""Thelonious (Monk) Ellison has never allowed race to define his identity.

"Perry Belcher, Trisha Sebastian (Goodreads Author) (Editor)",How To Start a Business From Home,,English,,"How to Start a Business is a conversational step-by-step guide to starting a small business. Inside you'll discover how to choose a business that's right for you, how to name your business, legal setup, leases, employees and more. The author Perry Belcher has started, ran and sold dozens of businesses and shares his experiences, mistakes and biggest breakthroughs.Does starting a business with a small amount of money sound too good to be true? No! There are many home based entrepreneurs who have successfully started their own businesses with little money. We’ve interviewed entrepreneurs who bootstrapped their businesses for as low as $500, yet they are now raking in money from their businesses. The lesson? Do things right! Of course, the ideal scenario is to start a business with enough money to enable you to move more aggressively and expand your business faster. But even if you do not have money, that should not prevent you from starting your own business. If you have great idea and a viable business plan, you can use Other People’s Money (OPM) to start your business. Or if you do not have access to OPM, you better learn how to tighten your belt and bootstrap your fledging business. Remember, while you may not be spending money, you still have to pay with something ­ your time and energy.Below are 10 areas Perry covers in his book:1. Think twice before borrowing. It would be ideal if you will not have to borrow money to start your business. After all, you want your own business to give you an additional source of income, if not the main paycheck. You do not need another bill to pay.But sometimes, you really have to borrow money to keep going. A major reason why many small businesses fail is inadequate capital. If you really have to, you must be prepared to take on the right kind of debt. Not all debt is bad debt. You have to ensure that before taking on a debt, you must see a way to pay it back through your business. As much as you want to be optimistic about your venture, there is always the possibility that your business can fail. Instead of fattening up your bank account, you could end up selling your house, your car and withdrawing your children’s college tuition just to pay off the debts. Be a smart risk taker.2. Be lean and mean. If you have limited capital, set aside any thoughts of a fancy store or great office. Start home-based and explore the advantages of working at home. Or if you must be “out there” selling your products, rent a small section at a flea market or fair. You may consider renting at the mall only when you see money coming in.In terms of legal structure, you can save tons of money by starting as a proprietorship. A Corporation is expensive to set-up, requires vast amounts of record-keeping, and will tax you twice ­ as an individual working for the business and as a corporation.Plus, you have to operate as tightly as possible. As a sole business owner on a budget, you do not have the luxury of wasting supplies, making unnecessary long-distance calls, and spending office money without a thought. Now every expense comes from your own pocket. Spend money only when you really have to. In fact, you can save tons of money if you select a business based on equipment that you already own. For example, consider starting a photography business if you already have your camera and photography gear. You may want to start a daycare business if you already have enough space in your house rather than spending money at the start of the business constructing new rooms in your house. If you must buy equipment, do so only when you have already landed your first account. Otherwise, consider renting it for the moment.3.

Perry Trouche,The Mule Shoe,,English,,"A TIME MACHINE COULD TAKE US NO CLOSER! Synopsis of The Mule Shoe by Perry Trouche Give a nearsighted child glasses for the first time and what you'll hear immediately is ""I can see the leaves."" This sudden clarity strikes the protagonist Conner DuMont in the final chapter of The Mule Shoe but it comes with a price. The dogma, promises and tradition of the past are gone. He can no longer go on doing things the way they have always been done. With this change comes awareness of his conformity and acquiescence to a society built on evil. The Mule Shoe is Conner's journey through his subconscious that takes him, past and present, through beliefs and memories to final acceptance of a new era built on truth. The trauma of the horror of combat hastens the process. Like the peeling of an onion causing tears, Conner's gradual descent into his mind unleashes emotions that overwhelm reality. The story is set at the battle of Spotsylvania, Virginia, in 1864 during the American Civil War, but Conner's mental journey encompasses his childhood on the sea islands of South Carolina, the recent death of his cousin for which he blames himself, and the fantasy of life through the eyes of the common soldiers he meets. He struggles to stay in the present but death, and the fear surrounding it, propel him into a dream world of memories, real and imagined. His day to day reality is increasingly bombarded with hallucinations in which the significant people of his past and present deliver a running commentary on his life. As the combat worsens at the Muleshoe Salient, he is unable to differentiate reality from delusion. He creates a world of calming touch to replace the insanity of war, readily embracing the delusion of soothing affection to overcome mind numbing savagery. The final acts of killing sever his last tie to his prior life. He retreats physically from battle as he wanders mentally in search of acceptance and peace. As he has learned to kill in reality, he finds he must do the same in his delusional world. The power to kill is the evil on which his world has been built. The final act of killing a childhood friend is so repugnant that it frees him from all attachment to his past. He accepts peace as he would use clear, cold water to rinse an open wound. Hope for life and peace replaces the misery of war. The Mule Shoe is twenty-four chapters, half of which are in the present, June 1864, and half, flashbacks and fantasy. The historical accuracy has been well researched and the emotional journey based on the author's extensive experience as a psychiatrist.",,,10/30/09,May 18th 2009,[],Hardcover,[],,9781932842333,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347711986l/7281589.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,7281589-the-mule-shoe,,,,,100.0,1.0,230,,Star Cloud Press,[],,,[],,

Souza was with President Obama more often, and at more crucial moments, than any friend or staff member, or even the First Lady--and he photographed it all. Souza captured nearly 2 million photographs of Obama, in moments ranging from classified to disarmingly candid.This large-format (12""x10""), exquisitely produced book presents more than 300 of Souza's favorite and most iconic images from these historic years; many have never been seen before. This seminal work on the Obama presidency documents moments of national importance--including the historic image of the President and his advisors watching tensely in the Situation Room as the Bin Laden mission unfolded--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his many encounters with children, and his time spent interacting with world leaders, members of Congress, White House staff, artists, musicians and more.The photographs are paired with captions and stories providing behind-the-scenes context for each, and offer insight into the special relationship Souza and the President forged during their time together. The result is a stunning record of a landmark era in American history.Souza's work enabled us to feel that we knew the President.

Hoewel zijn levensloop wel wordt gevolgd, gaat het hier niet om de historische juistheid, maar om het psychologisch portret dat uit het dagboek van Wilde spreekt. En dat portret is buitengewoon knap getekend: zowel de publieke persoonlijkheid van de dandy alsook de gevoelige en kunstzinnige estheet (die Wilde beide was) komen er in naar voren, verenigd op een wijze die een wel buitengewoon levendig beeld van Oscar Wilde schetst.

Peter Allison,"Whatever You Do, Don't Run: True Tales of a Botswana Safari Guide",,English,,"A hilarious, highly original collection of essays based on the Botswana truism: “only food runs!”In the tradition of Bill Bryson, a new writer brings us the lively adventures and biting wit of an African safari guide. Peter Allison gives us the guide’s-eye view of living in the bush, confronting the world’s fiercest terrain of wild animals and, most challenging of all, managing herds of gaping tourists. Passionate for the animals of the Kalahari, Allison works as a top safari guide in the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta. As he serves the whims of his wealthy clients, he often has to stop the impulse to run as far away from them as he can, as these tourists are sometimes more dangerous than a pride of lions. No one could make up these outrageous-but-true tales: the young woman who rejected the recommended safari-friendly khaki to wear a more “fashionable” hot pink ensemble; the lost tourist who happened to be drunk, half-naked, and a member of the British royal family; establishing a real friendship with the continent’s most vicious animal; the Japanese tourist who requested a repeat performance of Allison’s being charged by a lion so he could videotape it; and spending a crazy night in the wild after blowing a tire on a tour bus, revealing that Allison has as much good-natured scorn for himself. The author’s humor is exceeded only by his love and respect for the animals, and his goal is to limit any negative exposure to humans by planning trips that are minimally invasive—unfortunately it doesn’t always work out that way! Peter Allison is originally from Sydney, Australia. His safaris have been featured in National Geographic, Conde Nast Traveler, and on television programs such as Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures.

Every day, Paloma paddles her tiny boat into the ocean and anchors over a seamount—a submerged volcanic peak sixty feet underwater that is clustered with spectacular sea animals and a wondrous web of marine life. It is there that an astonishing event takes place, when on one of her dives Paloma is shadowed by a manta ray—an animal so large it blocks the sun. She develops an extraordinary relationship with this luminous, gentle creature, but instinctively knows its existence is a secret she must fiercely protect. Benchley’s novel paints a poignant picture of humanity’s precarious relationship with the ocean, which unfolds alongside a heartrending story of familial bonds, often revealing that the ignorance of man is far more dangerous than the sea.

Peter Benjaminson,The Lost Supreme: The Life of Dreamgirl Florence Ballard,,English,,"The Supremes were the most successful female vocal group in history. Of the three original members--Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard—two told their life stories in bestselling books. Only Florence Ballard, the spunky teenager who founded the group, remained silent. But, in the months before her 1976 death, Flo actually did tell her own side of the Supremes story—and the story of her entire life—to Peter Benjaminson, who recorded her words on tape. In this book, for the first time, is Flo Ballard’s entire heartbreaking tale, revealing: the suprising identity of the man who raped her before she entered the music business; the details of her love-hate relationship with Motown Records czar Berry Gordy—and an account of their first and only date; her serious drinking problem and ignored pleas for treatment; her never-ending desire to sing lead and how she was prevented from doing so; her attempts to get her life back on track after being brutally expelled from the Supremes; and much more. Flo Ballard traveled around the world in luxury, chatting with royalty and heads of state, applauded by millions. But when she died at the age of 32, she was a lonely mother of three just barely recovered from years of poverty and despair.

Peter Biskind,"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And-Rock-'N'-Roll Generation Saved Hollywood",,English,,"AcknowledgmentsHollywood is a town of fabulators. The people who dwell there create fictions for a living, fictions that refuse tidily to confine themselves to the screen, but spill over into the daily lives of the men and women who regard themselves as stars in the movies of their own lives. Although this book tells readers altogether more than they may wish to know about the Hollywood of the '70s, I do not flatter myself that I have arrived at ""the truth."" At the end of this long, twisted road I am once again struck with the force of the old maxim, the more you know, the more you know what you don't know. This is particularly true in the case of Hollywood, where despite the reams of memos and contracts that now gather dust on the shelves of university libraries, very little of what really matters is committed to paper, so that an endeavor of this sort is dependent on memory -- in this case of an era twenty or thirty years in the past. Not only is the terrain distant, but in this period memory has been enfeebled by booze and drugs.In a town where credit grabbing is an art form, to say that memory is self-serving is to say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Moreover, defect of memory is a shield that enables people to go to work in the morning, protecting them from the unspeakable behavior that is taken for granted there. As director Paul Schrader puts it, ""In this business, you've got to have a selective memory. Otherwise, it's too painful."" Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" remains one of the truest movies about the movies and the people who make them.In this maze of mirrors, lucky is the chronicler who does not lose his or her way in the infini, Alice Mayhew gave ither blessing, and Bob Bender, along with his assistant, Johanna Li, helped it to see the light of day. My agent, Kris Dahl, guided me through the shoals of writing and editing.Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Elizabeth Hess, and daughter, Kate, for their unfailing patience and support.Copyright © 1998 by Peter Biskind",,,09/27/98,December 10th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Film', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Media Tie In', 'Biography', 'Pop Culture', 'Cultural', 'Art', 'Journalism', 'American']",,9780747544210,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348128298l/15060.jpg,4.12,[],93.0,1.0,,15060.Easy_Riders_Raging_Bulls,,,,,96.0,6780.0,506,,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,"['2541', '2885', '1084', '200', '70']",,,[],,
Peter Biskind (Editor),My Lunches with Orson: Conversations between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles,,English,,"BASED ON LONG-LOST RECORDINGS, A SET OF RIVETING AND REVEALING CONVERSATIONS WITH AMERICA'S GREAT CULTURAL PROVOCATEURThere have long been rumors of a lost cache of tapes containing private conversations between Orson Welles and his friend the director Henry Jaglom, recorded over regular lunches in the years before Welles died. The tapes, gathering dust in a garage, did indeed exist, and this book reveals for the first time what they contain.Here is Welles as he has never been seen before: talking intimately, disclosing personal secrets, reflecting on the highs and lows of his astonishing career, the people he knew—FDR, Winston Churchill, Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier, David Selznick, Rita Hayworth, and more—and the many disappointments of his last years. This is the great director unplugged, free to be irreverent and worse—sexist, homophobic, racist, or none of the above— because he was nothing if not a fabulator and provocateur. Ranging from politics to literature to the shortcomings of his friends and the many films he was still eager to launch, Welles is at once cynical and romantic, sentimental and raunchy, but never boring and always wickedly funny.Edited by Peter Biskind, America's foremost film historian, My Lunches with Orson reveals one of the giants of the twentieth century, a man struggling with reversals, bitter and angry, desperate for one last triumph, but crackling with wit and a restless intelligence.

The various sectors of our communities--businesses, schools, social service organizations, churches, government--do not work together. They exist in their own worlds. As do so many individual citizens, who long for connection but end up marginalized, their gifts overlooked, their potential contributions lost. This disconnection and detachment makes it hard if not impossible to envision a common future and work towards it together. We know what healthy communities look like--there are many success stories out there, and they've been described in detail. What Block provides in this inspiring new book is an exploration of the exact way community can emerge from fragmentation: How is community built? How does the transformation occur? What fundamental shifts are involved?

Brannen examines the fossil record—which is rife with creatures like dragonflies the size of sea gulls and guillotine-mouthed fish—and introduces us to the researchers on the front lines who, using the forensic tools of modern science, are piecing together what really happened at the crime scenes of the Earth’s biggest whodunits.Part road trip, part history, and part cautionary tale, The Ends of the World takes us on a tour of the ways that our planet has clawed itself back from the grave, and casts our future in a completely new light.",,,06/13/17,June 19th 2018,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Environment', 'Geology', 'Nature', 'Audiobook', 'Climate Change', 'Biology', 'Palaeontology']",,9780062364814,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515856872l/36260386.jpg,4.29,[],95.0,1.0,,36260386-the-ends-of-the-world,,,,,98.0,3045.0,322,,Ecco,"['1415', '1191', '365', '61', '13']",,,[],,

Just like the rest of the gentlefolk of their day, they went to the circus theatre, of course. In 1810 where else could you find six hours of entertainment, good food, drink and amiable companionship? Where else could you see the epitome of horsemanship, jugglers, magicians, a drama by Shakespeare, and variety acts from around the world?Do you like a good mystery? Right now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., hanging next to the Gilbert Stuart image of George Washington (which also graces the one dollar bill), is an unfinished Stuart portrait entitled THE CIRCUS RIDER. The NGA claims the subject of THE CIRCUS RIDER was an English acquaintance of Washington; however, the portrait was earlier identified by reliable witnesses as being a Frenchman, BRESCHARD, THE CIRCUS RIDER.Jean Baptiste Breschard, along with his partner, Victor Pépin, built theatres in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Montreal, Havana, in every major American city, during the years surrounding the War of 1812. The Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia still stands and is the oldest continuously operating theatre in the English speaking world. M. Breschard, M. Pépin and Mme. Breschard were the premiere equestrians in this hemisphere when popular entertainment meant horsemanship. The Breschards and Pépin were the Elvis Presleys, the Samuel Goldwyns, and the P.T. Barnums of their day. Why have historians ignored America's greatest entertainers? Did the NGA make an honest mistake or did they believe they had created a superior circus story for attracting the public to their exhibitions? Combining primary sources and fiction, CIRCUS RIDER is both a novel and a history. Using a cross-disciplinary technique previously unavailable, connections among America's foremost statesmen, military men, architects, politicians and performers, during a time when the United States was at its greatest peril, are illuminated for the first time. CIRCUS RIDER is a novel history of the first American circus.

To his pursuers, Kelly is nothing but a monstrous criminal, a thief and a murderer. To his own people, the lowly class of ordinary Australians, the bushranger is a hero, defying the authority of the English to direct their lives. Indentured by his bootlegger mother to a famous horse thief (who was also her lover), Ned saw his first prison cell at 15 and by the age of 26 had become the most wanted man in the wild colony of Victoria, taking over whole towns and defying the law until he was finally captured and hanged. Here is a classic outlaw tale, made alive by the skill of a great novelist.

Peter Cashwell (Goodreads Author),The Verb 'To Bird': Sightings of an Avid Birder,,English,,"""[A] delightfully literary and eclectic memoir about the manifold joys of birding…Cashwell is a storyteller. A very literate, observant, insightful storyteller.""—The Bloomsbury Review""Reading this book was the next best thing to wandering in the woods with Peter Cashwell hoping to add a rufous-capped warbler to my life list. No, it was better—I could laugh out loud in delight as I turned the pages without fear of scaring the birds.""—Katharine Weber, author of The Music Lesson""An entertaining and witty meditation on birding.""—Library JournalAll around the world, birds are the subject of intense, even spiritual, fascination, but relatively few people see the word bird as a verb. Peter Cashwell is one who does, and with good reason: He birds (because he can't help it), and he teaches grammar (because he's paid to). An English teacher by profession and an avid birder by inner calling, Cashwell has written a whimsical and critical book about his many obsessions—birds, birders, language, literature, parenting, pop culture, and the human race.Cashwell lovingly but irreverently explores the practice of birding, from choosing a field guide to luring vultures out of shrubbery, and gives his own eclectic travelogue of some of the nation's finest bird habitats. Part memoir, part natural history, part apology, The Verb 'To Bird' will enlighten and entertain anyone who's ever wandered around wet fields at the crack of dawn with dog-eared field guides crushed against the granola bars in their pockets. But you don't have to know the field marks of an indigo bunting to appreciate Cashwell's experiences with non-lending libraries, venomous insects, sports marketing, and animated Christmas specials.""Birders as well as all others interested in birds will enjoy this witty and informative meditation. Declaring himself a victim of birding compulsive disorder, Cashwell, an English teacher in Virginia, does an excellent job of describing his fascination with observing and listening to birds.""—Publishers Weekly""Peter Cashwell possesses one of the rarest of all qualities in a nature writer: an intelligent wit.""—Robert Finch, co-editor of The Norton Book of Nature Writing""A fine literary ramble and a good laugh to boot—no mean feat in a genre that perhaps takes itself to seriously.""—John Hanson Mitchell, Editor of Sanctuary, Journal of the Massachusetts Audubon Society""Writing with humor and gentle environmental rants, Cashwell does for his beloved birds what Bill Bryson did for the Appalachian Trail in his best-selling A Walk in the Woods.""—Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star""[Cashwell] does not stint on the details that matter to birders, but it's his ability to translate the joy of the experience for the non-birder that extends the book's appeal beyond the Nature/Ornithology shelves.""—The Charlotte Observer""Cashwell plays with the language as joyfully and skillfully as a musician coaxes melodies from his instrument.""—Rocky Mount TelegramBirds first captured Peter Cashwell's attention when his mother hung an avian mobile over his crib. He was born in Raleigh, N.C., grew up in Chapel Hill, and graduated from the University of North Carolina, where he took every creative writing course permitted by the English department (and one that wasn't).

Peter Clines (Goodreads Author),The Fold,,English,,"STEP INTO THE FOLD. IT’S PERFECTLY SAFE.  The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn’t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he’s content with his quiet and peaceful existence.   That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to “fold” dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind’s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe.  Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn’t quite what it seems—and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there’s only one answer that makes sense. And if he’s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys…everything.  A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you’ll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller.

Peter D. Schiff;John Downes,Crash Proof,How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse,,Business & Economics,"The economic tipping point for the United States is no longer theoretical. It is a reality today. The country has gone from the world's largest creditor to its greatest debtor; the value of the dollar is sinking; domestic manufacturing is winding down - and these trends don't seem to be slowing. Peter Schiff casts a sharp, clear-sighted eye on these factors and explains what the possible effects may be and how investors can protect themselves. For more than a decade, Schiff has not only observed the U.S. economy, but also helped his clients reposition their portfolios to reflect his outlook. What he sees is a nation facing an economic storm brought on by growing federal, personal, and corporate debt, too-little savings, a declining dollar, and lack of domestic manufacturing. Crash-Proof is an informed and informative warning of a looming period marked by sizeable tax hikes, loss of retirement benefits, double digit inflation, even - as happened recently in Argentina - the possible collapse of the middle class.

"Peter E.S. Freund, George T.

(1993) An incalculable number have been seriously hurt. In the future, half the world is likely to be run over in a terminal squabble for oil. For today we are possessed by a mindless monster which threatens the planet itself.Considering the widespread impact of the auto on many contemporary societies, it is surprising how little attention its social and political dimensions receive - even from ecologically oriented thinkers. This, despite the fact that vehicular traffic is viewed as a major problem.In this original book, authors Freund and Martin examine the central role that auto production and consumption have played in the twentieth century: as a technological system with major impacts on public policy, land use, cultural patterns, social relations, community, natural resources, environmental quality and options for spatial mobility. The overuse and misuse that has caused auto saturation and the costs of auto-centred transport are identified.

Peter Englund,Poltava: Berättelsen om en armés undergång,,Swedish,,"Kriget hade pågått i nio långa år då Karl XII i juni 1709 befann sig vid den belägrade lilla staden Poltava i Ukraina på sin marsch mot Moskva. Den ryska armén under Peter den store hade närmat sig steg för steg och stod nu endast en halvmil bort. Svenskarna hade förberett sig för drabbningen och dragit ihop sina trupper som varit vitt spridda över hela den ukrainska slätten. Kungen utsåg fältmarskalken Rehnsköld till överbefälhavare och gav order om anfall, vilket skulle ske i gryningen måndagen den 28 juni. Man hade planerat att göra uppmarschen i skydd av mörkret och ta ryssarna med överraskning, men förflyttningen gick trögare än väntat och när solen gick upp var uppställningen inte klar. Det första anfallet misslyckades.Peter Englund skildrar det ödesdigra slaget timme för timme, katastrofen som ledde till det svenska stormaktsväldets fall. Mänskligt sett var det en brutal mass-slakt som ägde rum dessa heta sommardagar då 10.000 liv gick till spillo. Dagböcker och brev från tiden ger ögonvittnesskildringar.

Describing the experiences of twenty ordinary people from around the world, all now unknown, he explores the everyday aspects of war: not only the tragedy and horror, but also the absurdity, monotony and even beauty. Two of these twenty will perish, two will become prisoners of war, two will become celebrated heroes and two others end up as physical wrecks. One of them goes mad, another will never hear a shot fired.Following soldiers and sailors, nurses and government workers, from Britain, Russia, Germany, Australia and South America - and in theatres of war often neglected by major histories on the period - Englund reconstructs their feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.

Now an even greater danger has surfaced: a threat to the existence of the universe itself.At the very heart of the galaxy is the Void, a self-contained microuniverse that cannot be breached, cannot be destroyed, and cannot be stopped as it steadily expands in all directions, consuming everything in its path: planets, stars, civilizations. The Void has existed for untold millions of years. Even the oldest and most technologically advanced of the galaxy’s sentient races, the Raiel, do not know its origin, its makers, or its purpose.But then Inigo, an astrophysicist studying the Void, begins dreaming of human beings who live within it. Inigo’s dreams reveal a world in which thoughts become actions and dreams become reality. Inside the Void, Inigo sees paradise. Thanks to the gaiafield, a neural entanglement wired into most humans, Inigo’s dreams are shared by hundreds of millions–and a religion, the Living Dream, is born, with Inigo as its prophet. But then he vanishes.Suddenly there is a new wave of dreams. Dreams broadcast by an unknown Second Dreamer serve as the inspiration for a massive Pilgrimage into the Void. But there is a chance that by attempting to enter the Void, the pilgrims will trigger a catastrophic expansion, an accelerated devourment phase that will swallow up thousands of worlds. And thus begins a desperate race to find Inigo and the mysterious Second Dreamer. Some seek to prevent the Pilgrimage; others to speed its progress–while within the Void, a supreme entity has turned its gaze, for the first time, outward. . . .From the Hardcover edition.",Void #1,,10/29/07,March 25th 2008,"['Edeard', 'Corrie-Lyn', 'Justine Burnelli', 'Paula Myo', 'Salrana', 'Troblum', 'Oscar Monroe', 'Mr. Bovey', 'Master Akeem', 'Qatux', 'Nigel Sheldon', 'Sheldonite Likan', 'Bradley Johansson', 'Kazimir Burnelli', 'Wilson Kime', 'Gore Burnelli', 'Clemance', 'Marakata', 'Doc Seneo', 'Arminel', 'Mellanie Rescorai', 'Mistress Florell', 'Stubsy Florac', 'Anna Kime', 'Kanseen', 'Phelim', 'Melzar', 'Tomansio McFoster Stewart', 'Hanko', 'Barkus', 'Erik Horovi', 'Emily Alm', 'Fahin', 'Helenna', 'Ronark', 'Cheriton McOnna', 'Jesaral', 'Mykala', 'Grand Master Finitan', 'Dushiku', 'Rincenso', 'Viertz Accu', 'Mother Lorellan', 'Nelson Sheldon', 'Zehar', 'Isoix', 'Master Vosbol', 'Paul Alkoff', 'Bijulee', 'Lehr Trachtenberg', 'Lucken', 'Gonat', 'Imelda Viatak', 'Ami Cowee', 'Dybal', 'Monrol', 'Evox', 'Vic Russell', 'Clemensa', 'Dan Massell', 'Crispin Goldreich', 'Geepalt', 'Ericilla', 'Ansan Purillar', 'Creewan', 'Kavine', 'Topar', 'Graffal Ehasz', 'Halran', 'Cytus', 'Genril', 'Alcie', 'Tosyne']",Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Adventure', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Epic']",,9780345496539,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440047585l/866136._SY475_.jpg,4.19,[],198.0,3.0,,866136.The_Dreaming_Void,,,,,96.0,23908.0,630,,Del Rey,"['9854', '9711', '3492', '625', '226']",,,[],,

An indestructible microuniverse, the Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat. For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy--energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies... from everything that lives. Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker -- as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer -- continues to unfold. But now the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies -- and temptations more powerful still. With time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide whether to release Edeard's final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be. And Araminta must choose whether to run from her unwanted responsibilities or face them down, with no guarantee of success or survival.

"Peter F. Hamilton (Goodreads Author), Marta García Martínez (Translator)",Judas Unchained,,English,,"Robust, peaceful, and confident, the Commonwealth dispatched a ship to investigate the mystery of a disappearing star, only to inadvertently unleash a predatory alien species that turned on its liberators, striking hard, fast, and utterly without mercy. The Prime are the Commonwealth's worst nightmare. Coexistence is impossible with the technologically advanced aliens, who are genetically hardwired to exterminate all other forms of life. Twenty-three planets have already fallen to the invaders, with casualties in the hundreds of millions. And no one knows when or where the genocidal Prime will strike next. Nor are the Prime the only threat. For more than a hundred years, a shadowy cult, the Guardians of Selfhood, has warned that an alien with mind-control abilities impossible to detect or resist -- the Starflyer -- has secretly infiltrated the Commonwealth. Branded as terrorists, the Guardians and their leader, Bradley Johansson, have been hunted by relentless investigator Paula Myo. But now evidence suggests that the Guardians were right all along, and that the Starflyer has placed agents in vital posts throughout the Commonwealth -- agents who are now sabotaging the war effort. Is the Starflyer an ally of the Prime, or has it orchestrated a fight to the death between the two species for its own advantage?

The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone ""brothers"" have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies. Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood.The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster. Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again.

Peter Godwin (Goodreads Author),Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewJanuary 1998 Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa is the story of Peter Godwin's experiences growing up in Rhodesia. He recounts the story of that country's violent transformation into Zimbabwe, as well as his own personal metamorphoses from privileged boy to reluctant soldier to investigative journalist. Godwin's story begins, ""I think I first realized something was wrong when our next door neighbor, Oom Piet Oberholzer, was murdered. I must have been about five then. It was still five years before the real war would start."" The Godwins enjoyed a typical genteel existence in 1960 rural Rhodesia, their household including a ""garden boy,"" a ""cook boy,"" and a nanny. Peter's father managed a wood- and sugarcane-processing plant. His mother, a rural government doctor, was often called to pronounce deaths or conduct autopsies, for which she brought along her ""assistant,"" five-year-old Peter, who was responsible for shooing away the flies. Godwin's plans for attending college were squashed when he was drafted into the Rhodesian army and assigned to the ""Anti-Terrorist Unit,"" which proved to be an important experience in his life. When he later looked at himself, he saw a man ""coursed through with anger and despair. It was the face of someone who would kill an unarmed civilian for withholding information."" Disturbed by what he had become, Godwin left Rhodesia after he got out of the army, only to return in 1981 as a journalist. Rhodesia was now Zimbabwe, and the ""terrorists"" he had reluctantly fought against were now the country's rulers. Godwin reported on theutterbrutalities in Zimbabwe and the fate of Matabeleland, a black minority region in Zimbabwe. He described the army style of interrogation, in which ""before they even began to question you, they would break one wrist,"" and wrote about the old mines where bodies of the dead were buried. When Godwin's writings received worldwide attention, the Zimbabwean government tried to discredit him, and he received numerous death threats, escaping the country just hours before the police came looking for him. Mukiwa is not only a memoir but also a compelling adventure story that tells a personal saga that needs to be heard.

Peter Green,The Greco-Persian Wars,,English,,"This is a reissue, with a new introduction and an update to the bibliography, of the original edition, published in 1970 as The Year of Salamis in England and as Xerxes at Salamis in the U.S.The long and bitter struggle between the great Persian Empire and the fledgling Greek states reached its high point with the extraordinary Greek victory at Salamis in 480 B.C. The astonishing sea battle banished forever the specter of Persian invasion and occupation. Peter Green brilliantly retells this historic moment, evoking the whole dramatic sweep of events that the Persian offensive set in motion. The massive Greek victory, despite the Greeks' inferior numbers, opened the way for the historic evolution of the Greek states in a climate of creativity, independence, and democracy, one that provided a model and an inspiration for centuries to come.Green's accounts of both Persian and Greek strategies are clear and persuasive; equally convincing are his everyday details regarding the lives of soldiers, statesmen, and ordinary citizens.

Peter Guralnick,Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley,,,,"From the moment that he first shook up the world in the mid 1950s, Elvis Presley has been one of the most vivid and enduring myths of American culture.Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley is the first biography to go past that myth and present an Elvis beyond the legend. Based on hundreds of interviews and nearly a decade of research, it traces the evolution not just of the man but of the music and of the culture he left utterly transformed, creating a completely fresh portrait of Elvis and his world.This volume tracks the first twenty-four years of Elvis' life, covering his childhood, the stunning first recordings at Sun Records (""That's All Right,"" ""Mystery Train""), and the early RCA hits (""Heartbreak Hotel,"" ""Hound Dog,"" ""Don't Be Cruel""). These were the years of his improbable self-invention and unprecedented triumphs, when it seemed that everything that Elvis tried succeeded wildly. There was scarcely a cloud in sight through this period until, in 1958, he was drafted into the army and his mother died shortly thereafter. The book closes on that somber and poignant note.Last Train to Memphis takes us deep inside Elvis' life, exploring his lifelong passion for music of every sort (from blues and gospel to Bing Crosby and Mario Lanza), his compelling affection for his family, and his intimate relationships with girlfriends, mentors, band members, professional associates, and friends. It shows us the loneliness, the trustfulness, the voracious appetite for experience, and above all the unshakable, almost mystical faith that Elvis had in himself and his music. Drawing frequently on Elvis' own words and on the recollections of those closest to him, the book offers an emotional, complex portrait of young Elvis Presley with a depth and dimension that for the first time allow his extraordinary accomplishments to ring true.Peter Guralnick has given us a previously unseen world, a rich panoply of people and events that illuminate an achievement, a place, and a time as never revealed before. Written with grace, humor, and affection, Last Train to Memphis has been hailed as the definitive biography of Elvis Presley.

We will soon be able to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp. This bold, contrarian view, backed up by exhaustive research, introduces our near-term future, where exponentially growing technologies and three other powerful forces are conspiring to better the lives of billions. An antidote to pessimism by tech entrepreneur turned philanthropist, Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler. Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing—fast. The authors document how four forces—exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion—are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Abundance establishes hard targets for change and lays out a strategic roadmap for governments, industry and entrepreneurs, giving us plenty of reason for optimism.Examining human need by category—water, food, energy, healthcare, education, freedom—Diamandis and Kotler introduce dozens of innovators making great strides in each area: Larry Page, Steven Hawking, Dean Kamen, Daniel Kahneman, Elon Musk, Bill Joy, Stewart Brand, Jeff Skoll, Ray Kurzweil, Ratan Tata, Craig Venter, among many, many others. ",,,,February 21st 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Economics', 'Futurism', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Self Help', 'Entrepreneurship']",,9781451614213,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344396582l/13187824.jpg,4.11,"['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)']",183.0,2.0,,13187824-abundance,,,,,95.0,9458.0,400,,Free Press,"['3731', '3601', '1650', '361', '115']",,,[],,

Indeed, the experience of nature was, and still may be, a critical component of human physical, emotional, intellectual, and even moral development. Yet scientific knowledge of the significance of natureduring the different stages of childhood is sparse. This book provides scientificinvestigations and thought-provoking essays on children and nature.Children andNature incorporates research from cognitive science, developmental psychology, ecology, education, environmental studies, evolutionary psychology, politicalscience, primatology, psychiatry, and social psychology. The authors examine theevolutionary significance of nature during childhood; the formation of children'sconceptions, values, and sympathies toward the natural world; how contact withnature affects children's physical and mental development; and the educational andpolitical consequences of the weakened childhood experience of nature in modernsociety.",,,,May 3rd 2002,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Education']",,9780262611756,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347611734l/448644.jpg,4.18,[],92.0,1.0,,448644.Children_and_Nature,,,,,93.0,28.0,370,,MIT Press,"['14', '8', '4', '1', '1']",,,[],,

And of the few who have known this dangerous way of life, fewer still can recount their adventures with the flair of this former professional hunter-turned-writer.Based on Capstick's own experiences and the personal accounts of his colleagues, Death in the Long Grass portrays the great killers of the African bush-- not only the lion, leopard, and elephant, but the primitive rhino and the crocodile waiting for its unsuspecting prey, the titanic hippo and the Cape buffalo charging like an express train out of control. Capstick was a born raconteur whose colorful descriptions and eye for exciting, authentic detail bring us face to face with some of the most ferocious killers in the world-- underrated killers like the surprisingly brave and cunning hyena, silent killers such as the lightning-fast black mamba snake, collective killers like the wild dog. Readers can lean back in a chair, sip a tall, iced drink, and revel in the kinds of hunting stories Hemingway and Ruark used to hear in hotel bars from Nairobi to Johannesburg, as veteran hunters would tell of what they heard beyond the campfire and saw through the sights of an express rifle.As thrilling as any novel, as taut and exciting as any adventure story, Death in the Long Grass takes us deep into the heart of darkness to view the Africa that few people have ever seen.",,,01/01/77,January 15th 1978,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'Africa', 'Nature', 'History', 'Animals', 'Outdoors', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Survival']",,9780312186135,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311970503l/762732.jpg,4.39,[],100.0,1.0,,762732.Death_in_the_Long_Grass,,,,,97.0,1740.0,320,,St. Martin's Press,"['971', '553', '162', '35', '19']",,,[],,

Peter Hessler,River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze,,English,,"In the heart of China's Sichuan province lies the small city of Fuling. Surrounded by the terraced hills of the Yangtze River valley, Fuling has long been a place of continuity, far from the bustling political centers of Beijing and Shanghai. But now Fuling is heading down a new path, and gradually, along with scores of other towns in this vast and ever-evolving country, it is becoming a place of change and vitality, tension and reform, disruption and growth. As the people of Fuling hold on to the China they know, they are also opening up and struggling to adapt to a world in which their fate is uncertain.Fuling's position at the crossroads came into remarkably sharp focus when Peter Hessler arrived as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1996, marking the first time in more than half a century that the city had an American resident. He found himself teaching English and American literature at the local college, discovering how Shakespeare and other classics look when seen through the eyes of students who have been raised in the Sichuan countryside and educated in Communist Party doctrine. His students, though, are the ones who taught him about the ways of Fuling  and about the complex process of understanding that takes place when one is immersed in a radically different society.As he learns the language and comes to know the people, Hessler begins to see that it is indeed a unique moment for Fuling. In its past is Communist China's troubled history  the struggles of land reform, the decades of misguided economic policies, and the unthinkable damage of the Cultural Revolution  and in the future is the Three Gorges Dam, which upon completion will partly flood thecity and force the resettlement of more than a million people. Making his way in the city and traveling by boat and train throughout Sichuan province and beyond, Hessler offers vivid descriptions of the people he meets, from priests to prostitutes and peasants to professors, and gives voice to their views. This is both an intimate personal story of his life in Fuling and a colorful, beautifully written account of the surrounding landscape and its history. Imaginative, poignant, funny, and utterly compelling, River Town is an unforgettable portrait of a city that, much like China itself, is seeking to understand both what it was and what it someday will be.",China trilogy #1,,01/01/01,April 25th 2006,[],Paperback,"['China', 'Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'History', 'Asian Literature', 'Biography Memoir', 'Cultural']",,9780060855024,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415585591l/94053.jpg,4.23,['Kiriyama Prize for Nonfiction (2001)'],86.0,1.0,,94053.River_Town,,,,,97.0,11232.0,432,,Harper Perennial,"['4953', '4378', '1510', '299', '92']",,,['China'],,

Peter J. Story (Goodreads Author),Things Grak Hates,,English,,"Grak hates things. Lots of things. And with a peculiar intensity too.Grak’s contempt is so strong, in fact, that it often leaves his fellow tribesmen bewildered. And when attempting to describe his personality, they find themselves in need of words with greater nuance. “Neurotic” is typically used. “Sociopath” and “narcissist” are also common terms. The most popular descriptor, however, is “pathological.”Grak, on the other hand, sees his situation in a rather different light. He finds his behavior “necessary” and “selfless,” or even “benevolent” when his mood is just so. Most often, though, he simply attributes his nature to “being human.”But of all the things Grak despises, his antipathy for olives takes precedence. In his efforts to be rid of this nuisance, he gets his first taste of power and ignites a series of events with troubling consequences. Unwilling to give up his newfound influence, he sets about honing his only true talent: manipulation. But as his grip tightens, Grak’s naively selfish exterior crumbles to reveal a dark and malicious evil …In his debut work, author Peter J Story brews a robust psychological satire infused with dry humor and a pinch of emotion. Set just prior to recorded history, Things Grak Hates chronicles the life of a bizarre nomad and his descent toward evil. Along the way, this unconventional and introspective allegory explores a variety of complex issues. Among them: power, politics, religion, redemption, the dissemination of ideas, and human nature itself.",,,,November 18th 2014,[],ebook,"['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Politics', 'Literary Fiction']",,B00N5HSAUM,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396881604l/21856225.jpg,3.84,[],196.0,2.0,,21856225-things-grak-hates,,,,,85.0,129.0,334,,Paper Newt,"['49', '37', '24', '11', '8']",,,[],,

These are the opening lines of Kreeft's Three Philosophies of Life. He reflects that there are ultimately only three philosophies of life and each one is represented by one of these books of the Bible-life is vanity; life is suffering; life is love. In these three books Kreeft shows how we have Dante's great epic The Divine Comedy played out, from Hell to Purgatory to Heaven. But it is an epic played out in our hearts and lives, here and now. Just as there is movement in Dante's epic, so there is movement in these books, from Ecclesiates to Job, from Job to Song of Songs. Love is the final answer to Ecclesiastes' quest, the alternative to vanity, and the true meaning of life. Finally, Kreeft sees in these books the epitome of theological virtues of faith, hope and love and ""an essential summary of the spiritual history of the world.""",,,,1989.0,,,,0898702623,9780898702620,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iQ1kGnHQNw4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.3,,,,,,,,,,,,140.0,,,,406.0,,,,

What would he think of human progress since his day? How would he react to our values? To our culture? And what would he think of Jesus? Peter Kreeft, Christian philosopher and longtime admirer of the historic Socrates, imagines the result.

Throughout, Kreeft weaves an intriguing web as he brings Socrates closer and closer to a meeting with Jesus. Here is a startling and provocative portrayal of reason in search of truth.

Peter Limb,Nelson Mandela: A Biography,,English,,"Everyone should know the life story of Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders of all time, the first black president of South Africa, the most famous African, and a major world statesman. His inspiring life receives a fresh retelling in this new biography written especially for students and general readers. This volume is an enjoyable, authoritative, and balanced way to not only understand a great man, but also to understand a critical time in world history and race relations.

Through the landmark presidency of South Africa and post Nobel Peace Prize years up until today, he has continued as a peacemaker and agent for change.Chapter 1 covers his birth into a strong Xhosa family and clan, with cultural, historical, and geographical context, and the next chapter follows his elite education path, taking into consideration the forces and people who helped shape the future leader.

Peter M. Vishton,Scientific Secrets for Raising Kids Who Thrive,,English,,"Parenting advice isn't hard to find. There are thousands of books on the subject, as well as a multitude of websites. Much has also been written on the science of child development. What's been lacking, however, are sources of reliable advice that bring together the scientific research and its real-world applications. This course bridges the divide. In 24 engaging lectures, an expert in the cognitive development of early childhood presents what scientific research has revealed about the things parents can actively do to promote children’s long-term development right from birth. Professor Vishton delivers a wealth of practical tips to help children reach their full potential intellectually, emotionally, physically, and socially. And he supports it all with findings culled from the latest scientific literature. You’ll touch on topics across all areas of childrearing, from sleep and nutrition to behavior and academics. And you’ll get answers to many of the most common parenting questions:    Should I sleep-train my baby by letting her “cry it out”?   Should I let my infant, toddler, or child watch TV-and if so, how much?   Should I allow my child to play video games?   Should I pressure my picky eater to finish her vegetables?   Should I spank my child when he misbehaves? In addition to learning methods for laying an early foundation in subjects such as math and reading, you’ll gain information for boosting your children’s overall cognitive abilities-and even their IQ scores.

Peter Matthiessen,Shadow Country,,English,,"Peter Matthiessen’s great American epic–Killing Mister Watson, Lost Man’s River, and Bone by Bone–was conceived as one vast mysterious novel, but because of its length it was originally broken up into three books. In this bold new rendering, Matthiessen has cut nearly a third of the overall text and collapsed the time frame while deepening the insights and motivations of his characters with brilliant rewriting throughout. In Shadow Country, he has marvelously distilled a monumental work, realizing his original vision. Inspired by a near-mythic event of the wild Florida frontier at the turn of the twentieth century, Shadow Country reimagines the legend of the inspired Everglades sugar planter and notorious outlaw E. J. Watson, who drives himself relentlessly toward his own violent end at the hands of neighbors who mostly admired him, in a killing that obsessed his favorite son.Shadow Country traverses strange landscapes and frontier hinterlands inhabited by Americans of every provenance and color, including the black and Indian inheritors of the archaic racism that, as Watson’s wife observed, ""still casts its shadow over the nation.""",Shadow Country Trilogy #1-3,Modern Library,10/28/08,April 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'American', 'Contemporary', 'Crime']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1256068757l/2253484.jpg,4.05,"['National Book Award for Fiction (2008)', 'William Dean Howells Medal (2010)']",358.0,4.0,,2253484.Shadow_Country,,,,,92.0,4578.0,892,,Modern Library,"['1861', '1562', '791', '269', '95']",,,[],,

Peter Robb,A Death in Brazil,,English,,"Combining travel, history, culture, and his own memories of twenty years of Brazilian life, the author of Midnight in Sicily delves into the past and present of a country that affects our imagination like few other places on earthFrom his own near murder in Rio at the hands of an intruder twenty years ago and continuing through the recent slaying of a former president's bagman who looted the country of more than a billion dollars, violent death poses a steady threat in Peter Robb's brilliant travelogue through modern-day Brazil. It's not death, however, that leaves a lasting impression but the exuberant life force that emanates from the country and its people.Seeking to understand how extreme danger and passion can coexist in a nation for centuries, Robb travels from the cobalt blue shores of southern Brazil to the arid mountains of the northeast recounting four centuries of Brazilian history from the days of slavery to the recent election of the country's first working-class president. Much more than a journey through history, Robb renders in vivid detail the intoxicating pleasures of the food, music, and climate of the country and references the work of Brazil's greatest writers to depict a culture unlike any other.With a stunning prose style and an endlessly inquisitive intellect, Robb builds layer upon layer of history, culture, and personal reminiscence into a deeply personal, impressionistic portrait of a nation.

Peter Rollins,The Idolatry of God,,English,,"In contrast to the usual answers concerning the Good News of Christianity, Peter Rollins offers a radical and initially disturbing statement in his new book: you can't be satisfied; life is difficult; you don't know the secret. Peter argues that God has traditionally been thought of as a product that will make you whole, remove your suffering, and give you the answers. In contrast, Rollins outlines an understanding of faith that asks us to embrace suffering, face up to our unknowing, and fully accept the difficulties of existence. It is only as we embrace, affirm, and celebrate life in all of its highs and lows that we can find God. Not as that which will make everything better but as a loving presence that enables us to say yes in the bad times as well as the good. Rollinss radically different approach to Christianity includes living in a community that is ruled by love. Rather than maintaining that we are correct, we allow those who differ with us to judge us, and we examine ourselves through the other persons eyes. Whether listeners are devout believers or distant seekers, The Idolatry of God shows that we must lay down our certainties and honestly admit our doubts to identify with Jesus. Rollins purposely upsets fundamentalist certainty in order to open listeners up to a more loving, active manifestation of Christs love.",,,,January 1st 2013,[],Audible Audio,"['Theology', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Faith', 'Christian']",,9781469277868,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421364046l/16720104.jpg,3.95,[],29.0,1.0,,16720104-the-idolatry-of-god,,,,,92.0,975.0,5,,Brilliance Audio,"['332', '362', '200', '63', '18']",,,[],,

Soeben sind die Sachsen über den Hof seines Vaters in Britannien hergefallen und haben nicht nur den gesamten Hausstand verwüstet, sondern auch noch alle Schweine mitgenommen. Und ein Schweinehüter ohne Schweine ist im Grunde nur ein weiterer (überflüssiger) Esser mehr am Tisch. Außerdem wird eh Gwyns älterer Bruder den Hof erben. Und mit dem ist nicht gut Kirschen essen. Also macht sich Gwyn auf den Weg, in der Tasche nichts als etwas Proviant und eine Silbermünze seiner Schwester Muriel. Und ein geheimnisvolles Medaillon natürlich, dass der Junge einst von seiner Mutter geschenkt bekam und das ein Einhorn zeigt: sein größter Schatz. Unterwegs trifft Gwen auf den alternden Ritter Humbert, der ihm von der sagenhaften Tafelrunde König Arturs berichtet. Er weist ihm den Weg nach Camelot -- und damit einen Weg voller Abenteuer und Gefahren. Denn Mordred, der grüne Drache und Sohn des Königs, ist zu neuem Leben erwacht und zieht mit seinen Mannen mordend und brandschatzend durch die Lande.

Peter Singer (Goodreads Author),The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically,,English,,"From the ethicist the New Yorker calls “the most influential living philosopher,” a new way of thinking about living ethically""Singer’s argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it.""—Nicholas Kristof, 
  New York Times
""Bold, fresh, inspired, reasoned, optimistic.""—Walter M. Bortz II, MD, 
  Huffington Post Blog
 Peter Singer’s books and ideas have been disturbing our complacency ever since the appearance of Animal Liberation. Now he directs our attention to a new movement in which his own ideas have played a crucial role: effective altruism. Effective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the ""most good you can do."" Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us. Singer introduces us to an array of remarkable people who are restructuring their lives in accordance with these ideas, and shows how living altruistically often leads to greater personal fulfillment than living for oneself.The Most Good You Can Do develops the challenges Singer has made, in the New York Times and Washington Post, to those who donate to the arts, and to charities focused on helping our fellow citizens, rather than those for whom we can do the most good. Effective altruists are extending our knowledge of the possibilities of living less selfishly, and of allowing reason, rather than emotion, to determine how we live. The Most Good You Can Do offers new hope for our ability to tackle the world’s most pressing problems.",,,,April 7th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Society', 'Social Justice', 'International Development', 'Politics']",,9780300180275,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424307874l/23168483.jpg,3.85,[],59.0,1.0,,23168483-the-most-good-you-can-do,,,,,92.0,2302.0,232,,Yale University Press,"['608', '959', '553', '146', '36']",,,[],,

Peter Singer (Goodreads Author),Practical Ethics,,English,,"Peter Singer's remarkably clear and comprehensive Practical Ethics has become a classic introduction to applied ethics since its publication in 1979 and has been translated into many languages. For this second edition the author has revised all the existing chapters, added two new ones, and updated the bibliography. He has also added an appendix describing some of the deep misunderstanding of, and consequent violent reaction to, the book in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where the book has tested the limits of freedom of speech. The focus of the book is the application of ethics to difficult and controversial social questions: equality and discrimination by race, sex, ability, or species; abortion, euthanasia, and embryo experimentation; the moral status of animals; political violence and civil disobedience; overseas aid and the obligation to assist others; responsibility for the environment; the treatment of refugees. Singer explains and assesses relevant arguments in a perspicuous, non-doctrinaire way. He structures the book to show how contemporary controversies often have deep philosophical roots; and he presents an ethical theory of his own that can be applied consistently and convincingly to all the practical cases. The book's primary readership remains teachers and students of ethics whether in philosophy or some other branch of the humanities or social sciences.

"Peter Stamm, Michael Hofmann (Translator)",Seven Years,,English,,"Alex has spent the majority of his adult life between two very different women--and he can't make up his mind. Sonia, his wife and business partner, is everything a man would want. Intelligent, gorgeous, charming, and ambitious, she worked tirelessly alongside him to open their architecture firm and to build a life of luxury. But when the seven-year itch sets in, their exhaustion at working long hours coupled with their failed attempts at starting a family get the best of them. Alex soon finds himself kindling an affair with his college lover, Ivona. The young Polish woman who worked in a Catholic mission is the polar opposite of Sonia: dull, passive, taciturn, and plain. Despite having little in common with Ivona, Alex is inexplicably drawn to her while despising himself for it. Torn between his highbrow marriage and his lowbrow affair, Alex is stuck within a spiraling threesome.

Fans of Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic Strangers on a Train from the author of the acclaimed The Girl with a Clock for a Heart—which the Washington Post said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail.",,,,February 3rd 2015,"['Ted Severson', 'Lily Kintner', 'Miranda Severson', 'Brad Daggett', 'Eric Washburn', 'Detective Kimball']",Hardcover,"['Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Crime', 'Suspense', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Contemporary']",,9780062267528,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417981750l/21936809.jpg,4.03,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2015)', 'Gullkulen/The Golden Bullet Nominee (2016)']",16.0,1.0,,21936809-the-kind-worth-killing,,,,,95.0,89723.0,311,,William Morrow,"['29307', '39693', '16170', '3342', '1211']",,,['Maine (United States)'],,
Peter Swanson (Goodreads Author),Her Every Fear,,English,,"Growing up, Kate Priddy was always a bit neurotic, experiencing momentary bouts of anxiety that exploded into full-blown panic attacks after an ex-boyfriend kidnapped her and nearly ended her life. When Corbin Dell, a distant cousin in Boston, suggests the two temporarily swap apartments, Kate, an art student in London, agrees, hoping that time away in a new place will help her overcome the recent wreckage of her life.Soon after her arrival at Corbin’s grand apartment on Beacon Hill, Kate makes a shocking discovery: his next-door neighbor, a young woman named Audrey Marshall, has been murdered. When the police question her about Corbin, a shaken Kate has few answers, and many questions of her own—curiosity that intensifies when she meets Alan Cherney, a handsome, quiet tenant who lives across the courtyard, in the apartment facing Audrey’s. Alan saw Corbin surreptitiously come and go from Audrey’s place, yet he’s denied knowing her. Then, Kate runs into a tearful man claiming to be the dead woman’s old boyfriend, who insists Corbin did the deed the night that he left for London.When she reaches out to her cousin, he proclaims his innocence and calms her nerves--until she comes across disturbing objects hidden in the apartment and accidentally learns that Corbin is not where he says he is. Could Corbin be a killer? What about Alan? Kate finds herself drawn to this appealing man who seems so sincere, yet she isn’t sure.

Peter Sís,Tibet: Through the Red Box.,,English,,"As a child in 1950s Czechoslovakia, Caldecott Honor-winning artist Peter Sís would listen to mysterious tales of Tibet, ""the roof of the world."" The narrator, oddly enough, was his father--a documentary filmmaker who had been separated from his crew, caught in a blizzard, and (according to him, anyway) nursed back to health by gentle Yetis. Young Sís learned of a beautiful land of miracles and monks beset by a hostile China; of the 14th Dalai Lama, a ""Boy-God-King""; and of ""a magic palace with a thousand rooms--a room for every emotion and heart's desire."" Hearing these accounts--some extravagant but all moving--helped the boy recover from an accident. The stories also allowed Sís's father to relate an odyssey other adults didn't seem to want to know about in cold war Czechoslovakia. ""He told me, over and over again, his magical stories of Tibet, for that is where he had been. And I believed everything he said,"" Sís recalls. Still, after some time he too seemed to become immune, and the stories ""faded to a hazy dream."" With Tibet: Through the Red Box Sís finally pays tribute to this fantastical experience, illustrating key pages from his father's diary with complex, color-rich images of mazes, mountains, and mandalas. He also produces pictures of his family at home--simple, monochromatic images that are just as haunting as their Himalayan counterparts. In one, a wistful mother and two children gather around a Christmas tree, the absent father appearing as a featureless silhouette. Tibet is a treasure for the eyes and heart. Some will ask: Is it for children or adults? Others will wonder: Is it a work of art or a storybook? One of the many things that this book makes us realize is that such classifications are entirely (and happily) unnecessary. --Kerry Fried",,,11/06/98,January 1st 1999,[],Hardcover,"['Picture Books', 'Childrens', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Art', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Graphic Novels', 'Cultural']",,9781865081571,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1190237419l/1913599._SX318_.jpg,4.12,['Caldecott Medal Nominee (1999)'],93.0,1.0,,1913599.Tibet,,,,,94.0,858.0,32,,See notes,"['380', '263', '164', '39', '12']",,,[],,

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.

Peter Tremayne,Shroud for the Archbishop,,English,,"Wighard, Archbishop designate of Canterbury, has been found dead, garrotted in his chambers in Rome's Lateran Palace in the autumn of A.D. 664. His murderer seems apparent to all, since an Irish religieux was arrested by the palace guards as he fled Wighard's chamber, but the monk denies responsibility for the crime, and the treasures missing from Wighard's chambers are nowhere to be found. The bishop in charge of affairs at the Lateran Palace suspects a political motive and is wary of charging someone without independent evidence. So he asks Sister Fidelma of the Celtic Church to look into Wighard's death.

It can be as little as a single coin, or as massive as a win on the lottery. The subjects jostle for attention, from the aristocrat who made his fortune in the South Sea Bubble, to a baker struggling to turn a financial corner in the midst of a popular uprising in this present time. There are two boy heroes, and a fluffy rabbit in a children's tale. There is a nun wondering if the picture in the attic is worth anything.

Peter Wawerzinek,Rabenliebe,,German,,"Über fünfzig Jahre quälte sich Peter Wawerzinek mit der Frage, warum seine Mutter ihn als Waise in der DDR zurückgelassen hatte. Dann fand und besuchte er sie. Das Ergebnis ist ein literarischer Sprengsatz, wie ihn die deutsche Literatur noch nicht zu bieten hatte.Ihre Abwesenheit war das schwarze Loch, der alles verschlingende Negativpol in Peter Wawerzineks Leben. Wie hatte seine Mutter es ihm antun können, ihn als Kleinkind in der DDR zurückzulassen, als sie in den Westen floh? Der Junge, herumgereicht in verschiedenen Kinderheimen, blieb stumm bis weit ins vierte Jahr, mied Menschen, lauschte lieber den Vögeln, ahmte ihren Gesang nach, auf dem Rücken liegend, tschilpend und tschirpend. Die Köchin des Heims wollte ihn adoptieren, ihr Mann wollte das nicht. Eine Handwerkerfamilie nahm ihn auf, gab ihn aber wieder ans Heim zurück.Wo war Heimat? Wo seine Wurzeln? Wo gehörte er hin?Dass er auch eine Schwester hat, erfuhr er mit vierzehn. Im Heim hatte ihm niemand davon erzählt, auch später die ungeliebte Adoptionsmutter nicht. Als Grenz sol dat unternahm er einen Fluchtversuch Richtung Mutter in den Westen, kehrte aber, schon jenseits des Grenzzauns, auf halbem Weg wieder um. Wollte er sie, die ihn ausgestoßen und sich nie gemeldet hatte, wirk lich wiedersehen?Zeitlebens kämpfte Peter Wawerzinek mit seiner Mutterlosigkeit. Als er sie Jahre nach dem Mauerfall aufsuchte und mit ihr die acht Halbgeschwister, die alle in derselben Kleinstadt lebten, war das über die Jahrzehnte überlebens groß gewordene Mutterbild der Wirklichkeit nicht gewachsen. Es blieb bei der einzigen Begegnung. Aber sie löste – nach jahrelanger Veröffentlichungspause – einen Schreibschub bei Peter Wawerzinek aus, in dem er sich das Trauma aus dem Leib schrieb: Über Jahre hinweg arbeitete er wie besessen an Rabenliebe, übersetzte das lebenslange Gefühl von Verlassenheit, Verlorenheit und Muttersehnsucht in ein großes Stück Literatur, das in der deutschsprachigen Literatur seinesgleichen noch nicht hatte.",,,01/01/10,August 19th 2010,[],Hardcover,['German Literature'],,9783869710204,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1360153017l/8802774.jpg,3.35,"['Tage der deutschsprachigen Literatur for Ingeborg-Bachmann-Preis (2010)', 'Deutscher Buchpreis (German Book Prize) Nominee for Shortlist (2010)']",99.0,1.0,,8802774-rabenliebe,,,,,79.0,68.0,428,,Galiani Verlag,"['9', '25', '20', '9', '5']",,,[],,

"Peter Wohlleben, Tim Flannery (Foreword), Jane Billinghurst (Goodreads Author) (Translator), Suzanne Simard","The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World",,English,,"In The Hidden Life of Trees, Peter Wohlleben shares his deep love of woods and forests and explains the amazing processes of life, death, and regeneration he has observed in the woodland and the amazing scientific processes behind the wonders of which we are blissfully unaware. Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group.Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.",The Mysteries of Nature Series #1,,05/25/15,September 13th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Nature', 'Environment', 'Biology', 'Audiobook', 'Ecology', 'Plants', 'Natural History', 'Science Nature']",,9781771642484,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464281905l/28256439.jpg,4.05,"['Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) Nominee for International Book (2017)', ""Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator's Prize Nominee (2017)""]",179.0,2.0,,28256439-the-hidden-life-of-trees,,,,,94.0,36881.0,288,,Greystone Books,"['13588', '14162', '7019', '1617', '495']",,,[],,

Petro Marko,Qyteti i fundit,,,,"Në këtë roman bëhet fjalë për fundin e ushtrisë pushtuese italiane në Shqipëri. Pas kapitullimit të fashizmit, në portin e Durrësit tubohen ushtarët e mbetur nga lufta dhe presin anijet nga Italia për t'u kthyer në vendin e tyre. Pikërisht gjatë ditëve të pritjes në këtë qytet të improvizuar buzë detit, shkrimtari Petro Marko do të zbulojë histori, drama, karaktere, psikologji të nxjerra nga njerëzit e qytetit të fundit. Përveç kësaj autori do të sjellë edhe rrëfimin për dashurinë e oficerit të ri shqiptar Lekës dhe prostitutës së bukur italiane Ana Maria Monte, viktimë po ashtu e luftës dhe e fashizmit.Brenda 7 ditëve, aq sa qëndrojnë italianët e mbledhur në portin e Durrësit për t'u kthyer në Itali, shkrimtari në romanin ""Qyteti i fundit"" do të zbulojë dhe do të rrëfejë historitë dhe fatet e disave nga ushtria fashiste që para 4-5 viteve e kishte pushtuar Shqipërinë. Në këtë pleksje historish e fatesh, autori do të sajojë linjën e rrëfimit që ndjek hetimi për zbulimin e një krimineli lufte, të maskuar dhe të fshehur brenda turmës së ""Qytetit"". Në krye të grupit që duhet ta organizojë dhe ta udhëheqë këtë zbulim është toger Leka. Pista që ndjek togeri në këtë drejtim, e ngjashme me labirintet e romaneve dedektive, do të ecë dhe përmes prostitutës italiane - Ana Maria Monti. Dhe do të lindë dashuria mes tyre, që është shumëfish më ""mëkatare"" se ajo mes Gorit dhe Anitës.

"Phil Collen, Chris Epting (Goodreads Author) (With)","Adrenalized: Life, Def Leppard, and Beyond",,,,"A revelatory and redemptive memoir from the lead guitarist of the legendary band Def Leppard—the first book ever written by one of its members—chronicling the band’s extraordinary rise to superstardom and how they’ve maintained it for three decades.Meet Phil Collen. You may know him as the lead guitarist in Def Leppard, whose signature song “Pour Some Sugar on Me” is still as widely enjoyed as when it debuted in 1988. Maybe you’ve heard of him as the rock star who gave up alcohol and meat more than twenty-five years ago. Most likely you’ve seen him shirtless—in photos or in real life—flaunting his impeccably toned body to appreciative female fans.But it wasn’t always like this. Collen worked his way up from nothing, teaching himself guitar from scratch as a teenager by imitating his heroes. He slogged it out in London-based pub bands for years, long before Def Leppard formed and transformed from unknowns to icons (all thanks to a little album called Pyromania), from playing openers in near-empty arenas to headlining in those same stadiums and selling them out every night. But as Collen discovered, true overnight success is a myth. Like the other band members, he had to struggle and fight his way to the top; in the end, he says, “our work ethic saved us.” Just as it still does.This is Collen’s story, starting with his first real taste of success and wild rock and roll excess as a member of the seminal glam rock outfit Girl. But once he joins Def Leppard, it’s also an amazing underdog tale featuring a bunch of ordinary working-class lads who rose to mega-stardom, overcoming incredible obstacles—such as drummer Rick Allen losing an arm in a car crash and the tragic death of guitarist Steve Clark, Phil’s musical soul mate, who lost his fight with alcoholism. Featuring personal, never-before-seen photos of Collen and his band mates on stage and off, Adrenalized is a fascinating account of the failures, triumphs, challenges, and rock-hard dedication it takes to make dreams come true.",,,10/30/14,October 27th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']",,9781476751658,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431359740l/21412236._SY475_.jpg,3.6,[],96.0,1.0,,21412236-adrenalized,,,,,87.0,364.0,240,,Atria Books,"['84', '104', '129', '39', '8']",,,[],,

Phil Klay (Goodreads Author),Redeployment,,English,,"Phil Klay's Redeployment takes readers to the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, asking us to understand what happened there, and what happened to the soldiers who returned. Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival, the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. In ""Redeployment"", a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia, surrounded by people ""who have no idea where Fallujah is, where three members of your platoon died."" In ""After Action Report"", a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit, in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity, and his ability to provide solace through religion, tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic ""Money as a Weapons System"", a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents, Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth, this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation.",,,,March 4th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']",,9781594204999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417987993l/18114068.jpg,3.97,"['National Book Award for Fiction (2014)', 'Warwick Prize for Writing (2015)', ""Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award Nominee (2014)"", 'PEN/Robert W.

Phil Knight,Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of NIKE,,English,,"In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, different.Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.",,,04/24/16,April 26th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Sports', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Biography Memoir', 'Leadership']",,9781501135910,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1457284880l/27220736.jpg,4.48,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2016)'],543.0,6.0,,27220736-shoe-dog,,,,,97.0,147163.0,400,,Scribner,"['92151', '39835', '10971', '2473', '1733']",,,[],,

Doting Father. For thirty years, Richard The Iceman Kuklinski led a shocking double life, becoming the most notorious professional assassin in American history while happily hosting neighborhood barbecues in suburban New Jersey.Richard Kuklinski was Sammy the Bull Gravano's partner in the killing of Paul Castellano, then head of the Gambino crime family, at Sparks Steakhouse. Mob boss John Gotti hired him to torture and kill the neighbor who accidentally ran over his child. For an additional price, Kuklinski would make his victims suffer; he conducted this sadistic business with coldhearted intensity and shocking efficiency, never disappointing his customers. By his own estimate, he killed over two hundred men, taking enormous pride in his variety and ferocity of technique.This trail of murder lasted over thirty years and took Kuklinski all over America and to the far corners of the earth, Brazil, Africa, and Europe.

Philip Dray,There Is Power in a Union: The Epic Story of Labor in America,,English,,"From an award-winning historian, a stirring (and timely) narrative history of American labor from the dawn of the industrial age to the present day.  From the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, the first real factories in America, to the triumph of unions in the twentieth century and their waning influence today, the con­test between labor and capital for their share of American bounty has shaped our national experience.

There Is Power in a Union is an epic, character-driven narrative that locates this struggle for security and dignity in all its various settings: on picket lines and in union halls, jails, assembly lines, corporate boardrooms, the courts, the halls of Congress, and the White House.

Philip Freeman (Goodreads Author),Julius Caesar,,English,,"More than two thousand years after his death, Julius Caesar remains one of the great figures of history. He shaped Rome for generations, and his name became a synonym for ""emperor"" -- not only in Rome but as far away as Germany and Russia. He is best known as the general who defeated the Gauls and doubled the size of Rome's territories. But, as Philip Freeman describes in this fascinating new biography, Caesar was also a brilliant orator, an accomplished writer, a skilled politician, and much more.Julius Caesar was a complex man, both hero and villain. He possessed great courage, ambition, honor, and vanity. Born into a noble family that had long been in decline, he advanced his career cunningly, beginning as a priest and eventually becoming Rome's leading general. He made alliances with his rivals and then discarded them when it suited him. He was a spokesman for the ordinary people of Rome, who rallied around him time and again, but he profited enormously from his conquests and lived opulently. Eventually he was murdered in one of the most famous assassinations in history.Caesar's contemporaries included some of Rome's most famous figures, from the generals Marius, Sulla, and Pompey to the orator and legislator Cicero as well as the young politicians Mark Antony and Octavius (later Caesar Augustus). Caesar's legendary romance with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra still fascinates us today.In this splendid biography, Freeman presents Caesar in all his dimensions and contradictions. With remarkable clarity and brevity, Freeman shows how Caesar dominated a newly powerful Rome and shaped its destiny.

Philip G. Zimbardo,The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil,,English,,"Renowned social psychologist and creator of the ""Stanford Prison Experiment,"" Philip Zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things, how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally, and what this says about the line separating good from evil.The Lucifer Effect explains how—and the myriad reasons why—we are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side.” Drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research, Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women. Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week, the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around.",,,,April 17th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Social Science', 'Politics', 'Unfinished', 'Self Help']",,9781400064113,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388365513l/359194.jpg,3.94,['William James Book Award (2008)'],119.0,2.0,,359194.The_Lucifer_Effect,,,,,91.0,18426.0,551,,Random House (NY),"['6451', '6545', '3824', '1088', '518']",,,[],,
Philip Gourevitch,We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families,Stories From Rwanda,,History,"An unforgettable firsthand account of a people's response to genocide and what it tells us about humanity. This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda's ""genocidal logic"" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.

"Philip Gulley, James Mulholland",If God Is Love: Rediscovering Grace in an Ungracious World,,English,,"If God is love, why are so many Christians fearful, and why do so many church leaders sound hateful? Two controversial pastors address issues the church won′t face, calling us to restore grace as the center of the Christian life.o In If Grace Is True, Pastors Philip Gulley and James Mulholland revealed their belief that God will save every person. They now explore the implications of this belief, and its power to change every area of our lives. They attempt to answer one question: If we took God′s love seriously, what would our world look like?Gulley and Mulholland argue that what we believe is crucial and dramatically affects the way we live and interact in the world. Beliefs have power. The belief in a literal hell where people suffer eternally has often been used by the Church to justify hate and violence, which contradicts what Jesus taught about love and grace. The authors present a new vision for our personal, religious, and corporate lives, exploring what our world would be like if we based our existence on the foundational truth that God loves every person.Gulley and Mulholland boldly address many controversial issues people in the pews have wondered about but churches have been unwilling to tackle.

Philip José Farmer,To Your Scattered Bodies Go,,English,,"To Your Scattered Bodies Go is the Hugo Award-winning beginning to the story of Riverworld, Philip José Farmer's unequaled tale about life after death. When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom? That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. --Craig E.

Philip José Farmer,The Fabulous Riverboat,,English,,"In To Your Scattered Bodies Go, Philip José Farmer introduces readers to the awesome Riverworld, a planet that had been carved into one large river on whose shores all of humanity throughout the ages has seemingly been resurrected. In The Fabulous Riverboat, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by ""X,"" a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld. But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. --Craig E.

After 33 years on the river, Clemens and his crew--including the giant subhuman Joe Miller--are finally near the end of their journey, and only one obstacle remains: the evil Earthly king, John Lackland. John is waiting just upriver in the Rex Grandissimus, the first riverboat that Sam constructed and the one that John and his crew hijacked, and he's hell-bent on sinking Sam's boat (and vice versa). Complicating the battle is the fact that both ships likely contain agents of the Ethicals, the group of advanced beings who created Riverworld for reasons unknown. One or more of the Ethicals themselves may even be on board, as are various humans that the rebel Ethical, known as the Mysterious Stranger (but known to Clemens simply as X), enlisted in his cause, which may or may not lead to humanity's salvation. The battle is set to take place along the shores populated by members of the Church of the Second Chance, a group that believes they must attain ethical perfection in order to proceed to the next phase of existence. The Second Chancers are not violent, but their charismatic leader, La Viro, may attempt to sink one or both of the iron ships in order to prevent the battle. Among the Second Chancers is former Nazi officer Hermann Goring, who had a run-in with Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, To Your Scattered Bodies Go. Burton and his companions--among them several people who were contacted by the Mysterious Stranger--are reluctantly serving on John's boat in order to reach the headwaters of the river. But will any of the humans working for X survive the coming battle? And if so, how can they possibly hope to penetrate the tower in the North Sea where the Ethicals are thought to reside? And what could lowly humans hope to do against a race so advanced that they can reshape entire planets and resurrect all of humanity? --Craig E.

This question is at the heart of Philip K. Dick’s groundbreaking novel, the first book in his defining trilogy. When a beam of pink light begins giving a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat (who just might also be known as Philip K. Dick) visions of an alternate Earth where the Roman Empire still reigns, he must decide whether he is crazy, or whether a godlike entity is showing him the true nature of the world. The Divine Invasion God is not dead, he has merely been exiled to an extraterrestrial planet. And it is on this planet that God meets Herb Asher and convinces him to help retake Earth from the demonic Belial. As the middlie novel of Dick's VALIS trilogy, The Divine Invasion plays a pivotal role in answering the questions raised by the first novel, expanding that world while exploring just how much anyone can really know -- even God himself. The Transmigration of Timothy Archer The final book in the VALIS trilogy, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer brings the author’s search for the identity and nature of God to a close. The novel follows Bishop Timothy Archer as he travels to Israel, ostensibly to examine ancient scrolls bearing the words of Christ.

"Philip K. Dick, Jonathan Lethem (Editor)",Four Novels of the 1960s: The Man in the High Castle / The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch / Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? / Ubik,,English,,"Known in his lifetime primarily to readers of science fiction, Philip K. Dick is now seen as a uniquely visionary figure, a writer who, in editor Jonathan Lethem’s words, “wielded a sardonic yet heartbroken acuity about the plight of being alive in the twentieth century, one that makes him a lonely hero to the readers who cherish him.”This Library of America volume brings together four of Dick’s most original novels. The Man in the High Castle (1962), which won the Hugo Award, describes an alternate world in which Japan and Germany have won World War II and America is divided into separate occupation zones. The dizzying The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) posits a future in which competing hallucinogens proffer different brands of virtual reality, and an interplanetary drug tycoon can transform himself into a godlike figure transcending even physical death.Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), about a bounty hunter in search of escaped androids in a postapocalyptic society where status is measured by the possession of live animals and religious life is focused on a television personality, was the basis for the movie Blade Runner. Ubik (1969), with its future world of psychic espionage agents and cryonically frozen patients inhabiting an illusory “half-life,” pursues Dick’s theme of simulated realities and false perceptions to ever more disturbing conclusions, as time collapses on itself and characters stranded in past eras search desperately for the elusive, constantly shape-shifting panacea Ubik. As with most of Dick’s novels, no plot summary can suggest the mesmerizing and constantly surprising texture of these astonishing books.Posing the questions “What is human?” and “What is real?” in a multitude of fascinating ways, Dick produced works—fantastic and weird, yet developed with precise logic, marked by wild humor and soaring flights of religious speculation—that are startlingly prescient imaginative anticipations of 21st-century quandaries.",,,,May 10th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Anthologies', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Collections', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9781598530094,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347243952l/14182.jpg,4.37,[],98.0,1.0,,14182.Four_Novels_of_the_1960s,,,,,98.0,2081.0,830,,Library of America,"['1087', '737', '211', '35', '11']",,,[],,

Philip K. Howard,The Collapse of the Common Good,How America's Lawsuit Culture Undermines Our Freedom,,Political Science,"In pursuit of fairness at any cost, we have created a society paralyzed by legal fear: Doctors are paranoid and principals powerless. Little league coaches, scared of liability, stop volunteering. Schools and hospitals start to crumble. The common good fades, replaced by a cacophony of people claiming their “individual rights.” By turns funny and infuriating, this startling book dissects the dogmas of fairness that allow self-interested individuals to bully the rest of society. Philip K. Howard explains how, trying to honor individual rights, we removed the authority needed to maintain a free society. Teachers don’t even have authority to maintain order in the classroom. With no one in charge, the safe course is to avoid any possible risk. Seesaws and diving boards are removed. Ridiculous warning labels litter the American landscape: “Caution: Contents Are Hot.” Striving to protect “individual rights,” we ended up losing much of our freedom. When almost any decision that someone disagrees with is a possible lawsuit, no one knows where he stands. A huge monument to the unknown plaintiff looms high above America, casting a dark shadow across our daily choices. Today, in the land of free speech, you’d have to be a fool to say what you really think. This provocative book not only attacks the sacred cows of political correctness, but takes a breathtakingly bold stand on how to reinvigorate our common good. Only by restoring personal authority can schools begin to work again. Only by judges and legislatures taking back the authority to decide who can sue for what can doctors feel comfortable using their best judgment and American be liberated to say and do what they know is right. Lucid, honest, and hard hitting, The Collapse of the Common Good shows how Americans can bring back freedom and common sense to a society disabled by lawyers and legal fear.",,,,2002.0,,,,034543871X,9780345438713,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v1Upp5P_VrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.92,,,,,,,,,,,,272.0,,,,58.0,,,,

Philip Kerr,Berlin Noir: March Violets / The Pale Criminal / A German Requiem,,English,,"Now published in one paperback volume, these three mysteries are exciting and insightful looks at life inside Nazi Germany -- richer and more readable than most histories of the period. We first meet ex-policeman Bernie Gunther in 1936, in March Violets (a term of derision which original Nazis used to describe late converts.) The Olympic Games are about to start; some of Bernie's Jewish friends are beginning to realize that they should have left while they could; and Gunther himself has been hired to look into two murders that reach high into the Nazi Party. In The Pale Criminal, it's 1938, and Gunther has been blackmailed into rejoining the police by Heydrich himself. And in A German Requiem, the saddest and most disturbing of the three books, it's 1947 as Gunther stumbles across a nightmare landscape that conceals even more death than he imagines.

Philip Kerr,March Violets,,English,,"Hailed by Salman Rushdie as a ""brilliantly innovative thriller-writer,"" Philip Kerr is the creator of taut, gripping, noir-tinged mysteries that are nothing short of spellbinding. The first book of the Berlin Noir trilogy, March Violets introduces readers to Bernie Gunther, an ex-policeman who thought he'd seen everything on the streets of 1930's Berlin; until he turned freelance and each case he tackled sucked him further into the grisly excesses of Nazi subculture.Bernhard Gunther, a hard-boiled Berlin detective who specializes in tracking down missing persons — mostly Jews. He is summoned by a wealthy industrialist to find the murderer of his daughter and son-in-law, killed during the robbery of a priceless diamond necklace.Gunther quickly is catapulted into a major political scandal involving Hitler's two main henchmen, Goering and Himmler. The search for clues takes Gunther to morgues overflowing with Nazi victims; raucous nightclubs; the Olympic games where Jesse Owens tramples the theory of Aryan racial superiority; the boudoir of a famous actress; and finally to the Dachau concentration camp. Fights with Gestapo agents, shoot-outs with adulterers, run-ins with a variety of criminals, and dead bodies in unexpected places keep readers guessing to the very end.Hard-hitting, fast-paced, and richly detailed, March Violets is noir writing at its blackest and best.",Bernie Gunther #1,,03/23/89,July 27th 2004,"['Hermann Göring', 'Bernhard Gunther', 'Ilse Rudel', 'Hermann Six', 'Heinrich Himmler', 'Grete Six Pfarr', 'Paul Pfarr', 'Haupthändler', '""Red"" Dieter Helfferich', 'Marlene Sahm', 'Rienacker', 'Inge Lorenz', 'Bruno Stahlecker', 'Hannah ""Eva"" Roedl']",Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Germany', 'Noir', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Historical', 'Historical Mystery']",,9780142004142,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412369066l/236819.jpg,3.82,[],76.0,1.0,,236819.March_Violets,,,,,93.0,11285.0,245,,G.P.

Philip Kerr,If The Dead Rise Not,,English,,"An instant classic in the Bernie Gunther series, with storytelling that is fresher and more vivid than ever. Berlin, 1934: The Nazis have secured the 1936 Olympiad for the city but are facing foreign resistance. Hitler and Avery Brundage, the head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, have connived to soft-pedal Nazi anti- Semitism and convince America to participate. Bernie Gunther, now the house detective at an upscale Berlin hotel, is swept into this world of international corruption and dangerous double-dealing, caught between the warring factions of the Nazi apparatus.Havana, 1954: Batista, aided by the CIA, has just seized power; Castro is in prison; and the American Mafia is quickly gaining a stranglehold on the city's exploding gaming and prostitution industries. Bernie, who has been unceremoniously kicked out of Buenos Aires, has resurfaced in Cuba with a new life, seemingly one of routine and relative peace. But Bernie discovers that he truly cannot outrun the burden of his past: He soon collides with a vicious killer from his Berlin days, who is mysteriously murdered not long afterward-and an old lover, who may be the murderer.If the Dead Rise Not is everything fans have come to expect from Philip Kerr: twisted intrigue, tight plotting, quick-witted one-liners, a hang-by-your-thumbs ending, and, most significant, a richer, wiser Bernie Gunther.",Bernie Gunther #6,,09/03/09,March 18th 2010,['Bernhard Gunther'],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Germany', 'Noir', 'Detective', 'Historical', 'World War II']",,9780399156151,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442395334l/6690236._SY475_.jpg,4.11,"['Barry Award for Best British Crime Novel (2010)', 'Shamus Award Nominee for Best PI Novel (2011)', 'CWA Ellis Peters Historical Award (2009)', 'Premio Internacional RBA de Novela Negra (2009)']",77.0,1.0,,6690236-if-the-dead-rise-not,,,,,97.0,5536.0,448,,Marian Wood Book,"['1879', '2565', '928', '135', '29']",,,"['Berlin (Germany)', 'Havana (Cuba)']",,
Philip Kerr,The Other Side of Silence,,English,,"Once I’d been a good detective in Kripo, but that was a while ago, before the criminals wore smart gray uniforms and nearly everyone locked up was innocent.” Being a Berlin cop in 1942 was a little like putting down mousetraps in a cage full of tigers.The war is over. Bernie Gunther, our sardonic former Berlin homicide detective and unwilling SS officer, is now living on the French Riviera. It is 1956 and Bernie is the go-to guy at the Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, the man you turn to for touring tips or if you need a fourth for bridge. As it happens, a local writer needs just that, someone to fill the fourth seat in a regular game that is the usual evening diversion at the Villa Mauresque. Not just any writer. Perhaps the richest and most famous living writer in the world: W. Somerset Maugham. And it turns out it is not just a bridge partner that he needs; it’s some professional advice. Maugham is being blackmailed—perhaps because of his unorthodox lifestyle. Or perhaps because of something in his past, because once upon a time, Maugham worked for the British secret service, and the people now blackmailing him are spies.As Gunther fans know, all roads lead back to the viper’s nest that was Hitler’s Third Reich and to the killing fields that spread like a disease across Europe. Even in 1956, peace has not come to the continent: now the Soviets have the H-bomb and spies from every major power feel free to make all of Europe their personal playground.",Bernie Gunther #11,,,March 29th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Germany', 'Historical', 'Espionage', 'Noir', 'Detective']",,9780399177040,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438040879l/25893956.jpg,4.05,['CWA Endeavour Historical Dagger Nominee for Shortlist (2016)'],80.0,1.0,,25893956-the-other-side-of-silence,,,,,95.0,4255.0,416,,Marian Wood Books/Putnam,"['1472', '1805', '765', '163', '50']",,,['France'],,
Philip Kerr,Prague Fatale,,English,,"September 1941. Bernie Gunther returns from the horrors of the Eastern Front to find his home city of Berlin changed, and changed for the worse. Now back at his old desk on Homicide in Kripo HQ, Alexanderplatz, Bernie starts to investigate the death of a Dutch railway worker, while starting something - of an entirely different nature - with a local good-time girl.But he is obliged to drop everything when his old boss, Reinhard Heydrich of the SD, the new Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia, orders him to Prague to spend a weekend at his country house. It's an invitation Bernie feels he would gladly have been spared, especially when he meets his fellow guests - all of them senior loathsome figures in the SS and SD.The weekend turns sour almost immediately when a body is found, in a room that was locked from the inside. Now the spotlight falls on Bernie to show off his investigative skills and solve this seemingly impossible mystery. If he fails to do so, he knows what is at stake - not only his reputation, but also that of Reinhard Heydrich, a man who does not like to lose face.So begins the most diplomatically sensitive case of Bernie Gunther's police career.",Bernie Gunther #8,,10/27/11,Published,['Bernie Gunther'],Kindle Edition,"['Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Germany', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Noir', 'War']",,B005W0ARFQ,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352849119l/11448085.jpg,4.14,['Theakston Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Nominee for Longlist (2013)'],92.0,1.0,,11448085-prague-fatale,,,,,97.0,6154.0,527,,Cuercus,"['2191', '2856', '934', '142', '31']",,,[],,

"Philip Massinger, Michael Neill (Editor)",The Renegado,,English,,"The Renegado is one of the most shamelessly entertaining plays of its age, fetching its inspiration from a number of works by Cervantes, based on his own experiences as a captive in Algiers. Introducing the eroticized captivity narrative to the English stage, Massinger's tragicomedy combines it with the long-popular romance motif of a Christian hero's conquest of an exotic princess. But even as it indulges in romantic fantasy, The Renegado engages with contentious issues of national and international politics, offering a provocative response to the sectarian feuds dividing England in the 1620s, while exploiting wider European fears of the expansionist Muslim empire of the Ottomans. Through its treatment of religious confrontation and conversion, Massinger's play offers important insights into early modern constructions of the Islamic world, and emerges as a piece with unexpected resonances for our own time.This is the first major single-volume edition of The Renegado, making it properly available to all students and teachers of early modern drama. With detailed on-page commentary notes and an illustrated introduction assessing its impact on the Renaissance stage as well as its particular relevance to our contemporary multi-cultural society, it is a stimulating and original teaching edition.An extract from Cervantes' The Prisons of Algiers, a key source for the play, is given in an appendix and the whole Cervantes text is available on the Arden website as an additional resource.",,,,May 1st 2010,[],Paperback,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Read For School', 'Theatre']",,9781904271611,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315670178l/8607349.jpg,3.2,[],25.0,1.0,,8607349-the-renegado,,,,,80.0,107.0,272,,The Arden Shakespeare,"['8', '29', '49', '18', '3']",,,[],,

Now, at last, Norman turns his formidable talent to the Beatle for whom being a Beatle was never enough. Drawing on previously untapped sources, and with unprecedented access to all the major characters, Norman presents the comprehensive and most revealing portrait of John Lennon ever published.This masterly biography takes a fresh and penetrating look at every aspect of Lennon's much-chronicled life, including the songs that have turned him, posthumously, into a near-secular saint. In three years of research, Norman has turned up an extraordinary amount of new information about even the best-known episodes of Lennon folklore—his upbringing by his strict Aunt Mimi; his allegedly wasted school and student days; the evolution of his peerless creative partnership with Paul McCartney; his Beatle-busting love affair with a Japanese performance artist; his forays into painting and literature; his experiments with Transcendental Meditation, primal scream therapy, and drugs. The book's numerous key informants and interviewees include Sir Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin, Sean Lennon—whose moving reminiscence reveals his father as never seen before—and Yoko Ono, who speaks with sometimes shocking candor about the inner workings of her marriage to John.“[A] haunting, mammoth, terrific piece of work.” -New York Times Honest and unflinching, as John himself would wish, Norman gives us the whole man in all his endless contradictions—tough and cynical, hilariously funny but also naive, vulnerable and insecure—and reveals how the mother who gave him away as a toddler haunted his mind and his music for the rest of his days.",,,,October 28th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Pop Culture', 'Rock N Roll', 'British Literature']",,9780060754013,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399934365l/3423364.jpg,4.1,[],288.0,3.0,,3423364-john-lennon,,,,,94.0,9426.0,851,,Ecco,"['3865', '3442', '1514', '389', '216']",,,[],,

Philip Roth,Indignation,,English,,"Against the backdrop of the Korean War, a young man faces life’s unimagined chances and terrifying consequences.It is 1951 in America, the second year of the Korean War. A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio’s Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad -- mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy.As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father’s fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.Indignation, Philip Roth’s twenty-ninth book, is a story of inexperience, foolishness, intellectual resistance, sexual discovery, courage, and error. It is a story told with all the inventive energy and wit Roth has at his command, at once a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in his recent books and a powerful addition to his investigations of the impact of American history on the life of the vulnerable individual.",,1st edition,,September 5th 2008,['Marcus Messner'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Literature', 'Coming Of Age', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'The United States Of America']",,9780547054841,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348256144l/3015764.jpg,3.74,['Κρατικό Βραβείο Λογοτεχνικής Μετάφρασης for Μετάφραση Έργου Ξένης Λογοτεχνίας στην Ελληνική Γλώσσα (2010)'],140.0,2.0,,3015764-indignation,,,,,92.0,14352.0,235,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['2923', '6134', '4108', '976', '211']",,,"['Newark, New Jersey (United States)', 'New Jersey (United States)']",,
Philip Roth,Nemesis,,English,,"In the “stifling heat of equatorial Newark,” a terrifying epidemic is raging, threatening the children of the New Jersey city with maiming, paralysis, lifelong disability, and even death. This is the startling theme of Philip Roth’s wrenching new book: a wartime polio epidemic in the summer of 1944 and the effect it has on a closely knit, family-oriented Newark community and its children. At the center of Nemesis is a vigorous, dutiful twenty-three-year-old playground director, Bucky Cantor, a javelin thrower and weightlifter, who is devoted to his charges and disappointed with himself because his weak eyes have excluded him from serving in the war alongside his contemporaries. Focusing on Cantor’s dilemmas as polio begins to ravage his playground—and on the everyday realities he faces—Roth leads us through every inch of emotion such a pestilence can breed: the fear, the panic, the anger, the bewilderment, the suffering, and the pain. Moving between the smoldering, malodorous streets of besieged Newark and Indian Hill, a pristine children’s summer camp high in the Poconos—whose “mountain air was purified of all contaminants”—Roth depicts a decent, energetic man with the best intentions struggling in his own private war against the epidemic. Roth is tenderly exact at every point about Cantor’s passage into personal disaster, and no less exact about the condition of childhood. Through this story runs the dark questions that haunt all four of Roth’s late short novels, Everyman, Indignation, The Humbling, and now Nemesis: What kind of accidental choices fatally shape a life?

Philip Roth,Exit Ghost,,English,,"Like Rip Van Winkle returning to his hometown to find that all has changed, Nathan Zuckerman comes back to New York, the city he left eleven years before. Alone on his New England mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, no terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work and the enduring of old age.Walking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections that explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young couple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will flee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to city life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap his solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jamie, whose allure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: intimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body.The second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman’s youth, Amy Bellette, companion and muse to Zuckerman’s first literary hero, E. I. Lonoff. The once irresistible Amy is now an old woman depleted by illness, guarding the memory of that grandly austere American writer who showed Nathan the solitary path to a writing vocation.The third connection is with Lonoff’s would-be biographer, a young literary hound who will do and say nearly anything to get to Lonoff’s “great secret.” Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be involved again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman plays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities.Haunted by Roth’s earlier work The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost is an amazing leap into yet another phase in this great writer’s insatiable commitment to fiction.",Complete Nathan Zuckerman #9,,,October 1st 2007,"['Nathan Zuckerman', 'Amy Bellette', 'Jamie Logan', 'Nathan', 'Billy Davidoff', 'Richard Kliman']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'Americana', 'The United States Of America', 'Roman']",,9780618915477,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327631702l/703163.jpg,3.49,[],57.0,1.0,,703163.Exit_Ghost,,,,,88.0,4886.0,292,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['648', '1842', '1791', '484', '121']",,,"['Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)', 'Upper West Side, Manhattan, New York (United States)']",,

The speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent TV culture critic and star lecturer at a New York college - as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete's critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated.The agency of Kepesh's undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous, humblingly beautiful twenty-four-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles. When he becomes involved with her, Kepesh finds himself dragged helplessly into the quagmire of sexual jealousy and loss.

Philip Short,Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare (John MacRae Books),,English,,"A gripping and definitive portrait of the man who headed one of the most enigmatic and terrifying regimes of modern times In the three and a half years of Pol Pot's rule, more than a million Cambodians, a fifth of the country's population, were executed or died from hunger. An idealistic and reclusive figure, Pol Pot sought to instill in his people values of moral purity and self-abnegation through a revolution of radical egalitarianism. In the process his country descended into madness, becoming a concentration camp of the mind, a slave state in which obedience was enforced on the killing fields.How did a utopian dream of shared prosperity mutate into one of the worst nightmares humanity has ever known? To understand this almost inconceivable mystery, Philip Short explores Pol Pot's life from his early years to his death. Short spent four years traveling throughout Cambodia interviewing the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge movement, many of whom have never spoken before, including Pol Pot's brother-in-law and the former Khmer Rouge head of state. He also sifted through the previously closed archives of China, Russia, Vietnam, and Cambodia itself to trace the fate of one man and the nation that he led into ruin.This powerful biography reveals that Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were not a one-off aberration but instead grew out of a darkness of the soul common to all peoples. Cambodian history and culture combined with intervention from the United States and other nations to set the stage for a disaster whose horrors echo loudly in the troubling events of our world today.",,,09/05/00,2004,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Asia', 'Politics', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'World History']",,9780805066623,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436944276l/1560407._SY475_.jpg,3.89,['Kiriyama Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (2005)'],87.0,1.0,,1560407.Pol_Pot,,,,,94.0,1180.0,537,,John Macrae,"['311', '516', '281', '51', '21']",,,[],,

""When someone tells me yet another horror story about the church, I respond, 'Oh, it's even worse than that. Let me tell you my story.'I have spent most of my life in recovery from the church.""Yancey acknowledges that many spiritual seekers find few answers and little solace in the institutional church. ""I have met many people, and heard from many more, who have gone through a similar process of mining truth from their religious past: Roman Catholics who flinch whenever they see a nun or priest, former Seventh Day Adventists who cannot drink a cup of coffee without a stab of guilt, Mennonites who worry whether wedding rings give evidence of worldliness.""How did Yancey manage to survive spiritually despite early encounters with a racist, legalistic church that he now views as almost cultic? In this, his most soul-searching book yet, he probes that very question. He tells the story of his own struggle to reclaim belief, interwoven with inspiring portraits of notable people from all walks of life, whom he calls his spiritual directors. Soul Survivor is his tribute to thirteen remarkable individuals, mentors who transformed his life and work.Besides recalling their effect on him, Yancey also provides fresh glimpses of the lives and faith journeys of each one. From the scatterbrained journalist G. K. Chesterton to the tortured novelists Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, to contemporaries such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Annie Dillard, and Robert Coles, Yancey gives inspiring portraits of those who modeled for him a life-enhancing rather than a life-constricting faith.""I became a writer, I now believe, to sort out and reclaim words used and misused by the Christians of my youth,"" Yancey says. ""These are the people who ushered me into the Kingdom. In many ways they are why I remain a Christian today, and I want to introduce them to other spiritual seekers.""Soul Survivor offers illuminating insights that will enrich the lives of veteran believers and cautious seekers alike.

Philip Yancey (Goodreads Author),What's So Amazing About Grace?,,English,,"Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656In 1987, an IRA bomb buried Gordon Wilson and his twenty-year-old daughter beneath five feet of rubble. Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers, ' I have lost my daughter, but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray, tonight and every night, that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears  and out of one man's grief, the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate, and the one thing it craves above all else  for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. In What's So Amazing About Grace? award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images, tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin, says Yancey, but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking, scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse, the racist, the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. In his most personal and provocative book ever, Yancey offers compelling, true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks, How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear?

"Philip Zaleski (Goodreads Author), Carol Zaleski (Goodreads Author)","The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings: J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams",,English,,"A stirring group biography of the Inklings, the Oxford writing club featuring J.R.R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis C.S. Lewis is the twentieth century’s most widely read Christian writer and J.R.R. Tolkien its most beloved mythmaker. For three decades, they and their closest associates formed a literary club known as the Inklings, which met weekly in Lewis’s Oxford rooms and in nearby pubs. They discussed literature, religion, and ideas; read aloud from works in progress; took philosophical rambles in woods and fields; gave one another companionship and criticism; and, in the process, rewrote the cultural history of modern times.In The Fellowship, Philip and Carol Zaleski offer the first complete rendering of the Inklings’ lives and works. C. S. Lewis accepts Jesus Christ while riding in the sidecar of his brother's motorcycle, maps the medieval and Renaissance mind, becomes a world-famous evangelist and moral satirist, and creates new forms of religiously attuned fiction while wrestling with personal crises. J.R.R. Tolkien transmutes an invented mythology into gripping story in The Lord of the Rings, while conducting groundbreaking Old English scholarship and elucidating, for family and friends, the Catholic teachings at the heart of his vision. Owen Barfield, a philosopher for whom language is the key to all mysteries, becomes Lewis's favorite sparring partner, and, for a time, Saul Bellow's chosen guru. And Charles Williams, poet, author of ""supernatural shockers,"" and strange acolyte of romantic love, turns his everyday life into a mystical pageant.Romantics who scorned rebellion, fantasists who prized reality, wartime writers who believed in hope, Christians with cosmic reach, the Inklings sought to revitalize literature and faith in the twentieth century's darkest years--and did so in dazzling style.",,,,June 2nd 2015,"['C.S.

Philipp Blom,A Wicked Company: The Forgotten Radicalism of the European Enlightenment,,English,,"The flourishing of radical philosophy in Baron Thierry Holbachâ€™s Paris salon from the 1750s to the 1770s stands as a seminal event in Western history. Holbachâ€™s house was an international epicenter of revolutionary ideas and intellectual daring, bringing together such original minds as Denis Diderot, Laurence Sterne, David Hume, Adam Smith, Ferdinando Galiani, Horace Walpole, Benjamin Franklin, Guillaume Raynal, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.In A Wicked Company, acclaimed historian Philipp Blom retraces the fortunes of this exceptional group of friends. All brilliant minds, full of wit, courage, and insight, their thinking created a different and radical French Enlightenment based on atheism, passion, reason, and truly humanist thinking.

Philipp Meyer (Goodreads Author),The Son,,English,,"The acclaimed author of American Rust, returns with The Son: an epic, multigenerational saga of power, blood, and land that follows the rise of one unforgettable Texas family from the Comanche raids of the 1800s to the border raids of the early 1900s to the oil booms of the 20th century.Part epic of Texas, part classic coming-of-age story, part unflinching portrait of the bloody price of power, The Son is an utterly transporting novel that maps the legacy of violence in the American West through the lives of the McCulloughs, an ambitious family as resilient and dangerous as the land they claim.Spring, 1849. The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their ways and language, answering to a new name, carving a place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men-complicating his sense of loyalty and understanding of who he is. But when disease, starvation, and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, civilized or fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world in which he does not fully belong-a journey of adventure, tragedy, hardship, grit, and luck that reverberates in the lives of his progeny. Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son, Peter, a man who bears the emotional cost of his father's drive for power, and JA, Eli's great-granddaughter, a woman who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.Phillipp Meyer deftly explores how Eli's ruthlessness and steely pragmatism transform subsequent generations of McCulloughs. Love, honor, children are sacrificed in the name of ambition, as the family becomes one of the richest powers in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Yet, like all empires, the McCoulloughs must eventually face the consequences of their choices.Harrowing, panoramic, and vividly drawn, The Son is a masterful achievement from a sublime young talent.",,,09/01/12,May 28th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Westerns', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780062120397,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355349098l/16240761.jpg,4.0,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2013)', ""Writers' League of Texas Book Award in Fiction (2013)""]",387.0,5.0,,16240761-the-son,,,,,93.0,30655.0,561,,Ecco,"['10817', '11926', '5736', '1559', '617']",,,['Texas (United States)'],,

Behind the triangle of lovers, the factions take up their places: the Protestants, the priests, the assassins, the diplomats and the moneymakers. The very coin of England is shaved and clipped to nothing as Elizabeth uncertainly leads her bankrupt country into a war that no-one thinks can be won.Then someone acts in secret, and for Elizabeth, Dudley and the emerging kingdom, nothing will be as planned.Blending historical fact with contemporary rumor, Philippa Gregory has created a dark and tense novel of Tudor times, which casts Elizabeth I in a light no one has suggested before.

Philippa Gregory (Goodreads Author),The Other Queen,,English,,"Two women competing for a man's heart. Two queens fighting to the death for dominance. The untold story of Mary, Queen of Scots.  This dazzling novel from the #1 New York Times bestselling author Philippa Gregory presents a new and unique view of one of history's most intriguing, romantic, and maddening heroines. Biographers often neglect the captive years of Mary, Queen of Scots, who trusted Queen Elizabeth's promise of sanctuary when she fled from rebels in Scotland and then found herself imprisoned as the ""guest"" of George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and his indomitable wife, Bess of Hardwick.  The newly married couple welcome the doomed queen into their home, certain that serving as her hosts and jailers will bring them an advantage in the cutthroat world of the Elizabethan court. To their horror, they find that the task will bankrupt them, and as their home becomes the epicenter of intrigue and rebellion against Elizabeth, their loyalty to each other and to their sovereign comes into question. If Mary succeeds in seducing the earl into her own web of treachery and treason, or if the great spymaster William Cecil links them to the growing conspiracy to free Mary from her illegal imprisonment, they will all face the headsman.  Philippa Gregory uses new research and her passion for historical accuracy to place a well-known heroine in a completely new tale full of suspense, passion, and political intrigue.

Philippe Besson,Retour parmi les hommes,,French,,"En 1916, à la mort d’Arthur, son jeune amant tué au combat, Vincent de l’Etoile, héros d’ En l’absence des hommes, s’est enfui. En Italie, d’abord, puis au Moyen Orient, en Egypte, au Soudan, en Abyssinie sur les traces de Rimbaud, en Syrie, au Liban ; errance de vagabond inconsolable, miséreux et rêveur ; puis c’est la traversée de l’Atlantique dans un bateau d’émigrants, l’Amérique, le New-York des années vingt. Après quelques années de dérive à traîner son deuil à travers le monde, Vincent retourne en France en 1923 ; c’est un peu comme s’il acceptait enfin la mort d’Arthur. Quand il retrouve sa ville natale, il ne reconnaît rien et peine à trouver sa place dans ce Paris des années folles. Son mentor, l’écrivain Marcel Proust, est mort lui aussi. Mais le hasard va le mettre en présence de Raymond Radiguet qui vient de publier Le diable au corps. C’est un très jeune homme, talentueux, brillant, charismatique qui séduit profondément Vincent. L’attrait est réciproque bien que Radiguet soit hétérosexuel. Avec cette énergie et cette joie de vivre qui est la sienne, l’écrivain en vogue, protégé de Cocteau, entraîne son nouvel ami dans les milieux intellectuels parisiens et les folles nuits de Montparnasse. Mais il existe une face sombre de Radiguet. Une fêlure chez ce garçon de vingt ans qui malgré sa gloire éclatante et brutale semble pressentir le sort tragique qui le guette et cette fièvre typhoïde qui va le tuer en décembre 1923. Déambulation hypnotique à travers le monde, qui convoque les fantômes de Kafka, Rimbaud, Nizan ou Dos Passos, voyage solitaire où le héros se perd et se dissout plus qu’il ne se reconstruit, où le déracinement demeure même une fois retrouvées ses racines, ce très beau livre à la fois grave et lumineux, est un chant d’amour déchirant à la gloire des êtres aimés à jamais disparus, un livre sur la douleur vécue comme exil intérieur.",,,,January 6th 2011,[],Paperback,"['France', 'Fiction']",,9782260018575,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327558264l/10299349.jpg,3.86,[],99.0,1.0,,10299349-retour-parmi-les-hommes,,,,,97.0,59.0,213,,Julliard,"['16', '22', '19', '1', '1']",,,[],,

Apenas ha transcurrido un ano desde el final de la guerra cuando una muerte rompe la tranquilidad de un pequeno pueblo perdido en las montanas. El unico extranjero del lugar a quien llaman Der Anderer el Otro en aleman ha sido asesinado y todos los hombres de la localidad se confiesan autores del crimen.

O lo que existio pero ya no existe Brodeck comprende que no le conviene saber demasiado.

Phillip Cary,Augustine's Invention of the Inner Self: The Legacy of a Christian Platonist,,English,,"In this book, Phillip Cary argues that Augustine invented the concept of the self as a private inner space-a space into which one can enter and in which one can find God. Although it has often been suggested that Augustine in some way inaugurated the Western tradition of inwardness, this is the first study to pinpoint what was new about Augustine's philosophy of inwardness and situate it within a narrative of his intellectual development and his relationship to the Platonist tradition. Augustine invents the inner self, Cary argues, in order to solve a particular conceptual problem. Augustine is attracted to the Neoplatonist inward turn, which located God within the soul, yet remains loyal to the orthodox Catholic teaching that the soul is not divine. He combines the two emphases by urging us to turn ""in then up""--to enter the inner world of the self before gazing at the divine Light above the human mind. Cary situates Augustine's idea of the self historically in both the Platonist and the Christian traditions. The concept of private inner self, he shows, is a development within the history of the Platonist concept of intelligibility or intellectual vision, which establishes a kind of kinship between the human intellect and the divine things it sees. Though not the only Platonist in the Christian tradition, Augustine stands out for his devotion to this concept of intelligibility and his willingness to apply it even to God. This leads him to downplay the doctrine that God is incomprehensible, as he is convinced that it is natural for the mind's eye, when cleansed of sin, to see and understand God. In describing Augustine's invention of the inner self, Cary's fascinating book sheds new light on Augustine's life and thought, and shows how Augustine's position developed into the more orthodox Augustine we know from his later writings.",,,12/01/99,April 3rd 2003,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Religion', 'History', 'Theology']",,9780195158618,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348895210l/226153.jpg,4.4,[],86.0,1.0,,226153.Augustine_s_Invention_of_the_Inner_Self,,,,,100.0,20.0,232,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['10', '8', '2', '0', '0']",,,[],,
Phillip Cary,Inner Grace: Augustine in the Traditions of Plato and Paul,,English,,"This book is, along with Outward Signs (OUP 2008), a sequel to Phillip Cary's Augustine and the Invention of the Inner Self (OUP 2000). In this work, Cary traces the development of Augustine's epochal doctrine of grace, arguing that it does not represent a rejection of Platonism in favor of a more purely Christian point of view a turning from Plato to Paul, as it is often portrayed. Instead, Augustine reads Paul and other Biblical texts in light of his Christian Platonist inwardness, producing a new concept of grace as an essentially inward gift. For Augustine, grace is needed first of all to heal the mind so it may see God, but then also to help the will turn away from lower goods to love God as its eternal Good. Eventually, over the course of Augustine's career, the scope of the soul's need for grace expands outward to include not only the inner vision of the intellect and the power of love but even the initial gift of faith.At every stage, Augustine insists that divine grace does not compromise or coerce the human will but frees, heals, and helps it, precisely because grace is not an external force but an inner gift of delight leading to true happiness. As his polemic against the Pelagians develops, however, he does attribute more to grace and less to the power of free will. In the end, it is God's choice which makes the ultimate difference between the saved and the damned, and we cannot know why he chooses to save one person and not another. From this Augustinian doctrine of divine choice or election stem the characteristic pastoral problems of predestination, especially in Protestantism. A more external, indeed Jewish, doctrine of election would be more Biblical, Cary suggests, and would result in a less anxious experience of grace.Along with its companion work, Outward Signs, this careful and insightful book breaks new ground in the study of Augustine's theology of grace and sacraments.",,,02/27/08,March 26th 2008,[],Hardcover,[],,9780195336481,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348540801l/3284107.jpg,4.09,[],87.0,1.0,,3284107-inner-grace,,,,,100.0,11.0,189,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['4', '4', '3', '0', '0']",,,[],,

But their efforts were not in vain: the boys' exploits and eventual imprisonment helped spark a full-blown Danish resistance.

Phillip Knightley,The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero & Myth-maker from the Crimea to Iraq,,English,,"""The first casualty when war comes, is truth,"" said American Senator Hiram Johnson in 1917. In his gripping, now-classic history of war journalism, Phillip Knightley shows just how right Johnson was. From William Howard Russell, who described the appalling conditions of the Crimean War in the Times of London, to the ranks of reporters, photographers, and cameramen who captured the realities of war in Vietnam, The First Casualty tells a fascinating story of heroism and collusion, censorship and suppression.Since Vietnam, Knightley reveals, governments have become much more adept at managing the media, as highlighted in chapters on the Falklands War, the Gulf War, and the conflict between NATO and Serbia over Kosovo. And in a new chapter on the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Knightley details even greater degrees of government manipulation and media complicity, as evidenced by the ""embedding"" of reporters in military units and the uncritical, openly patriotic coverage of these conflicts. ""The age of the war correspondent as hero,"" he concludes, ""appears to be over.""

As the pace of living grows faster and the impact of new technologies more insistent, communications become hurried and impersonal. The drive for profit overrides the heart. Warmth and genuine presence fade. In eighteen interlocking chapters, Dr. Ferrucci reveals that the kindest people are the most likely to thrive, to enable others to thrive, and to slowly but steadily turn our world away from violence, self-centeredness, and narcissism- and toward love.

Peter Abélard paints an absorbing portrait of monastic and scholastic life in twelfth-century Paris, while also recounting the circumstances and consequences of one of history’s most famous love stories--his doomed romance with Heloise.Considered the founder of the University of Paris, Abélard was instrumental in promoting the use of the dialectical method in Western education. He regarded theology as the ""handmaiden"" of knowledge and believed that through reason, people could attain a greater knowledge of God. ""By doubting,"" he declared, ""we come to inquire, and by inquiry we arrive at truth."" Abélard's tendency to leave questions open for discussion made him a target for frequent charges of heresy, and all his works were eventually included in the church's Index of Forbidden Books.

Lord have pity on us!""With these words, Pierre Boulle hurtles the reader onto the Planet of the Apes. In this simian world, civilization is turned upside down: apes are men and men are apes; apes rule and men run wild; apes think, speak, produce, wear clothes, and men are speechless, naked, exhibited at fairs, used for biological research. On the planet of the apes, man, having reached to apotheosis of his genius, has become inert.To this planet come a journalist and a scientist. The scientist is put into a zoo, the journalist into a laboratory. Only the journalist retains the spiritual strength and creative intelligence to try to save himself, to fight the appalling scourge, to remain a man.Out of this situation, Pierre Boulle has woven a tale as harrowing, bizarre, and meaningful as any in the brilliant roster of this master storyteller. With his cutomary wit, irony, and disciplined intellect and style, the author of The Bridge Over the River Kwai tells a swiftly moving story dealing with man's conflicts, and takes the reader into a suspenseful and strangely fascinating orbit.",,,10/28/63,May 29th 2001,"['Zira', 'Ulysse Mérou', 'Cornelius (Planet of the Apes)', 'Zaius', 'Professor Antelle', 'Arthur Levain', 'Nova (Planet of the Apes)', 'Jinn (Planet of the Apes)', 'Phyllis (Planet of the Apes)']",Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'France', 'Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Media Tie In']",,9780345447982,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320558901l/414895.jpg,3.96,[],498.0,7.0,,414895.Planet_of_the_Apes,,,,,94.0,32904.0,268,,Del Rey,"['11020', '12122', '7633', '1603', '526']",,,['Soror'],,

Pierre Trudeau,Memoirs,,English,,"Pierre Trudeau was prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. This is his story, told in his own words.Take a look through the book. When you do, you will find that this remarkable memoir has many qualities. It is:PERSONALAs if he were sitting across the table from you, Pierre Trudeau reminisces about his life in an informal, direct way. He starts with his memories of his family, especially his mother and father, to whom the book is dedicated. There are memorable events from childhood here, such as a visit to complain to the principal on his second day at school. Later there is a lunchroom encounter with a high school bully and then, at the age of fifteen, real tragedy.“Aroused by the ringing of the telephone, I came out of my room to go downstairs and find out what was happening. But I froze on the landing when I heard the awful words: ‘Your father is dead, Pierre.’”PHILOSOPHICALAfter an extensive education in Montreal, Boston, London, and Paris, Trudeau set off with a backpack to travel around the world. He tells how he went through one war zone after another, encountering armed bandits and being arrested in wartime Jordan as a Jewish spy. These adventures and further travels through India and war-torn China left with him a deep belief in the rights of the individual and the vital role of government in protecting these rights. He tells how his hatred of narrow nationalism reinforced his stand against requests for special treatment by successive Quebec governments.POLITICALFrom the day he decided to go to Ottawa as a Liberal MP in 1965, Trudeau was clearly on a fast track. After becoming minister of justice in 1967 and tackling very controversial law reforms, he ran for the leadership and became prime minister in 1968 – the first Canadian leader born in the twentieth century. He talks about his use of “the Liberal machine” and all the electoral fights that followed over the year, providing interesting insights into his contests with national opponents such as Robert Stanfield, David Lewis, Joe Clark (a tougher opponent than the man who deposed him), Ed Broadbent, and Brian Mulroney, about whose virtues he is eloquently silent.PERSONALITY-FILLEDAs a leader whose time in office ran from the fall of Charles de Gaulle to the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev, Pierre Trudeau was able to exert his influence to break down the Cold War mentality. He enjoyed good personal rapport with such different leaders as Chou Enlai, Jimmy Carter, Fidel Castro, Helmut Schmidt, and François Mitterand. His relations with Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher were less warm, and he was less impressed by Ronald Reagan’s intellect than by the wisdom of the Queen.PATRIOTICWhether they loved him or hated him, Canadians knew that in Pierre Trudeau’s time, the government stood up for Canada. He stood up to the domestic terrorism of the FLQ – and he makes no apologies here for his tough response to the October Crisis in 1970 – just as he stood up to the provincial premiers (including Réné Lévesque) who he believed were blocking the patriation of Canada’s constitution ten years later.PERTINENTThe author’s preface ends with a word to you, the reader. “Whether you were a Liberal Cabinet colleague, a Canadian voter whose support we sought, or a young Canadian whose future we tried to improve, you are a part of this book.”",,,January 1st 1993,February 1st 1995,['Pierre Trudeau'],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'History', 'Canada', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir']",,9780771085871,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387663014l/393640.jpg,3.92,[],29.0,1.0,,393640.Memoirs,,,,,95.0,291.0,400,,McClelland & Stewart,"['69', '145', '63', '12', '2']",,,[],,

Writing with humour, humanity and solid scientific information reminiscent of Stumbling on Happiness and Freakonomics, Piers Steel explains why we knowingly and willingly put off a course of action despite recognizing we'll be worse off for it.For those who surf the Web instead of finishing overdue assignments, who always say diets start tomorrow, who stay up late watching TV to put off going to sleep, The Procrastination Equation explains why we do what we do — or in this case don't — and why in Western societies we're in the midst of an escalating procrastination epidemic.Dr. Piers Steel takes on the myths and misunderstandings behind procrastination and motivation — showing us how procrastination affects our lives, health, careers and happiness and what we can do about it. With accessible prose and the benefits of new scientific research, he provides insight into why we procrastinate even though the result is that we are less happy, healthy, even wealthy. Who procrastinates and why? How many ways, big and small, do we procrastinate? How can we stop doing it? The reasons are part cultural, part psychological, part biological. And, with a million new ways to distract ourselves in the digitized world — all of which feed on our built-in impulsiveness — more of us are potentially damaging ourselves by putting things off.

Pino Roveredo,Caracreatura,,Italian,,"Marina è una donna di mezza età, con una vita alle spalle fatta di fatiche e abbandoni, di violenze famigliari subìte per destino, ma con una voglia di riscatto che non è venuta mai meno e che alla fine pare averla condotta alle soglie di una nuova esistenza, serena, assieme al marito Federico e al figlio Gianluca. Ma qualcosa poi s’incrina, lo spettro della più grande piaga del nostro tempo, la droga, entra dalla porta di casa e sparge il suo veleno. Gianluca smarrisce se stesso, finisce in carcere: il mondo si è ribaltato, e tutto è accaduto in un attimo. E allora, ecco profilarsi l’odissea di questa Madre coraggio. Plebea e sublime, volgare e delicata – perché la contraddizione appartiene all’anima delle persone in cui dimora la verità – Marina farà di tutto per salvare la sua caracreatura, fino a un gesto d’amore estremo e sorprendente.Pino Roveredo ritorna con una storia in presa diretta che possiede il rigore di una perfetta macchina narrativa.

Their conversation develops into a wide-ranging discussion on such subjects as the pursuit of beauty, the immortality of the soul and the attainment of truth, and ends with an in-depth consideration of the principles of rhetoric. Probably a work of Plato's maturity, the Phaedrusrepresents a high point in his achievement as a writer.

Plato,Plato in twelve volumes,Symposium ; Gorgias. Lysis,,Literary Criticism,"Plato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.",,,,1975.0,,,,0674991842,9780674991842,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRaDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.39,,,,,,,,,,,,560.0,,,,426.0,,,,

Plato,"""Gorgias"" and ""Phaedrus""","Rhetoric, Philosophy, and Politics",,Philosophy,"With a masterful sense of the place of rhetoric in both thought and practice and an ear attuned to the clarity, natural simplicity, and charm of Plato's Greek prose, James H. Nichols Jr., offers precise yet unusually readable translations of two great Platonic dialogues on rhetoric. The Gorgias presents an intransigent argument that justice is superior to injustice: To the extent that suffering an injustice is preferable to committing an unjust act. The dialogue contains some of Plato's most significant and famous discussions of major political themes, and focuses dramatically and with unrivaled intensity on Socrates as a political thinker and actor. Featuring some of Plato's most soaringly lyrical passages, the Phaedrus investigates the soul's erotic longing and its relationship to the whole cosmos, as well as inquiring into the nature of rhetoric and the problem of writing. Nichols's attention to dramatic detail brings the dialogues to life. Plato's striking variety in conversational address (names and various terms of relative warmth and coolness) is carefully reproduced, as is alteration in tone and implication even in the short responses. The translations render references to the gods accurately and non-monotheistically for the first time, and include a fascinating variety of oaths and invocations. A general introduction on rhetoric from the Greeks to the present shows the problematic relation of rhetoric to philosophy and politics, states the themes that unite the two dialogues, and outlines interpretive suggestions that are then developed more fully for each dialogue. The twin dialogues reveal both the private and the political rhetoric emphatic in Plato's philosophy, yet often ignored in commentaries on it. Nichols believes that Plato's thought on rhetoric has been largely misunderstood, and he uses his translations as an opportunity to reconstruct the classical position on right relations between thought and public activity.",,,,1998.0,,,,0801435307,9780801435300,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBmKQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.41,,,,,,,,,,,,233.0,,,,15.0,,,,

Plato,The Atlantis Dialogue,,,Fiction,"Atlantis was first introduced by the Greek philosopher Plato in two ""dialogues"" he wrote in the fourth century B.C. His tale of a great empire that sank beneath the waves has sparked thousands of years of debate over whether Atlantis really existed. But did Plato mean his tale as history, or just as a parable to help illustrate his philosophy? In ""The Atlantis Dialogue,"" you'll find everything Plato said about Atlantis, in the context he intended. Now you can read and judge for yourself //////////////////////////////////////// ""An easy read . . . Provides a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about the Atlantis myth."" -- Judy Justice, Midwest Book Review, Mar. 2002 (Reviewer s Choice) //////////////////////////////////////// SAMPLE CRITIAS: Consider then, Socrates, if this narrative is suited to the purpose, or whether we should seek for some other instead. SOCRATES: And what other, Critias, can we find that will be better than this, which is natural and suitable to the festival of the goddess, and has the very great advantage of being a fact and not a fiction? How or where shall we find another if we abandon this? We cannot, and therefore you must tell the tale, and good luck to you; and I in return for my yesterday's discourse will now rest and be a listener. CRITIAS: Let me begin by observing first of all, that nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between those who dwelt outside the pillars of Heracles and all who dwelt within them; this war I am going to describe. Of the combatants on the one side, the city of Athens was reported to have been the leader and to have fought out the war; the combatants on the other side were commanded by the kings of Atlantis, which, as I was saying, was an island greater in extent than Libya and Asia, and when afterwards sunk by an earthquake, became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of the ocean. The progress of the history will unfold the various nations of barbarians and families of Hellenes which then existed, as they successively appear on the scene; but I must describe first of all Athenians of that day, and their enemies who fought with them, and then the respective powers and governments of the two kingdoms.

The discussion culminates in a radical challenge to conventional views by Plato's mentor, Socrates, who advocates transcendence through spiritual love. The Symposium is a deft interweaving of different viewpoints and ideas about the nature of love--as a response to beauty, a cosmic force, a motive for social action and as a means of ethical education.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Plato;Hugh Tredennick,The Last Days of Socrates,,,Fiction,"Chronicling the life and death of the father of western philosophy, and charting his influence on the most influential ancient Greek philosophers, Plato's The Last Days of Socrates is translated from the Greek by Hugh Tredennick, revised with an introduction and notes by Harold Tarrant in Penguin Classics. The trial and condemnation of Socrates on charges of heresy and corrupting young minds is a defining moment in the history of Classical Athens. In tracing these events through four dialogues, Plato also developed his own philosophy, based on Socrates' manifesto for a life guided by self-responsibility. Euthyphro finds Socrates outside the court-house, debating the nature of piety, while the Apology is his robust rebuttal of the charges of impiety and a defence of the philosopher's life. In the Crito, while awaiting execution in prison, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. Finally, in the Phaedo, he is shown calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul. Hugh Tredennick's landmark 1954 translation has been revised by Harold Tarrant, reflecting changes in Platonic studies, with an introduction and expanded introductions to each of the four dialogues. Plato (c.427-347 BC) stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He founded the Academy in Athens, the first permanent institution devoted to philosophical research and teaching, and the prototype of all Western universities.

Whereas sometimes he barely touched on great events, he devoted much space to anecdote & incidental triviality, this often telling more about his subjects than their famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to painting. Indeed, he went to great (often tenuous) length to draw parallels between physical appearance & character.

He portrays virtues to be emulated and vices to be avoided, but his purpose is also implicitly to educate and warn those in his own day who wielded power. In prose that is rich, elegant and sprinkled with learned references, he explores with an extraordinary degree of insight the interplay of character and political action. While drawing chiefly on historical sources, he brings to biography a natural story-teller's ear for a good anecdote. Throughout the ages Plutarch's Lives have been valued for their historical value and their charm. This new translation will introduce new generations to his urbane erudition.

Portia de Rossi,Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain,,English,,"“I didn’t decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .” Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying. In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn’t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point. Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder. From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues. In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",,,,November 1st 2010,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'LGBT', 'Mental Health', 'Biography Memoir', 'Mental Illness', 'Psychology', 'Queer']",,9781439177808,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1292739170l/9219901.jpg,3.84,['Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2010)'],98.0,1.0,,9219901-unbearable-lightness,,,,,91.0,37743.0,320,,Atria Books,"['11128', '13852', '9204', '2548', '1011']",,,[],,

Preeta Samarasan (Goodreads Author),Evening Is the Whole Day,,English,,"Set in Malaysia, this spellbinding and already internationally acclaimed debut introduces us to the prosperous Rajasekharan family as its closely guarded secrets are slowly peeled away.When Chellam, the family’s rubber-plantation-bred servant girl, is dismissed for unnamed crimes, her banishment is the latest in a series of recent, precipitous losses that have shaken six-year-old Aasha’s life. A few short weeks before, Aasha’s grandmother Paati passed away under mysterious circumstances and her older sister, Uma, departed for Columbia University--leaving Aasha alone to cope with her mostly absent father, her bitter mother, and her imperturbable older brother.Beginning with Aasha’s grandfather’s ascension from Indian coolie to illustrious resident of the Big House on Kingfisher Lane, and going on to tell the story of how Appa, the family’s Oxford-educated patriarch, courted Amma, the humble girl next door, Evening Is the Whole Day moves gracefully backward and forward in time to answer the many questions that haunt the family: What was Chellam’s unforgivable crime? Why was Uma so intent on leaving? How and why did Paati die? What did Aasha see? And, underscoring all of these mysteries: What ultimately became of Appa’s once-grand dreams for his family and his country? Sweeping in scope, sumptuously lyrical, and masterfully constructed, Evening Is the Whole Day offers an unflinching look at relationships between parents and children, brothers and sisters, the wealthy and the poor, a country and its citizens--and the ways in which each sometimes fails the other. Illuminating in heartbreaking detail one Indian immigrant family’s secrets and lies while exposing the complex underbelly of Malaysia itself, Preeta Samarasan’s debut is a mesmerizing and vital achievement sure to earn her a place alongside Arundhati Roy, Kiran Desai, and Zadie Smith.",,,11/05/08,May 15th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'India', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Asian Literature', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction', 'Childrens']",,9780618874477,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333346494l/2154433.jpg,3.64,"['Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2009)', 'Hopwood Award', 'Jules Hopwood', 'Avery Hopwood Award', 'POPULAR-The Star Readers’ Choice Awards for Fiction (2009)']",76.0,1.0,,2154433.Evening_Is_the_Whole_Day,,,,,85.0,1608.0,340,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['390', '541', '442', '172', '63']",,,['Malaysia'],,

Primo Levi,The Drowned and the Saved,,,Auschwitz (Poland : Concentration camp),"Shortly after completing THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED, Primo Levi committed suicide. The matter of his death was sudden, violent and unpremiditated, and there were some who argue that he killed himself because he was tormented by guilt - guilt that he had survived the horrors of Auschwitz while others, better than he, had gone to the wall. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED is Levi's impassioned attempt to understand the 'rationale' behind the concentration camps, was completed shortly before his tragic death in 1987. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED dispels the myth that Primo Levi forgave the Germans for what they did to his people. He didn't and couldn't forgive. He refused, however, to indulge in what he called 'the bestial vice of hatred' which is an entirely different matter. The voice that sounds in his writing is that of a reasonable man...it warns and reminds us that the unimaginable can happen again.

Each centres on an individual who - whether it be through a juggling trick, a slice of apple or a letter - discovers one of the 'bizarre, marginal moments of reprieve'.The English edition includes just one section of the three originally published in Italian under the title 'Lilít', tales from the other two sections have been published in 'A Tranquil Star'.",Auschwitz Trilogy,Penguin Modern Classics,10/30/81,September 26th 2002,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Holocaust', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Short Stories', 'Italian Literature', '20th Century', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'Jewish']",,9780141186979,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348615203l/275651.jpg,4.24,['Premio Grinzane Cavour Nominee for Narrativa Italiana (1982)'],100.0,1.0,,275651.Moments_of_Reprieve,,,,,98.0,843.0,172,,Penguin Books,"['356', '355', '111', '17', '4']",,,[],,

The mâquis is the domain of the Corsican shepherds and of those who are at variance with justice. It must be known that, in order to save himself the trouble of manuring his field, the Corsican husbandman sets fire to a piece of woodland. If the flame spread farther than is necessary, so much the worse! In any case he is certain of a good crop from the land fertilized by the ashes of the trees which grow upon it. He gathers only the heads of his grain, leaving the straw, which it would be unnecessary labor to cut. In the following spring the roots that have remained in the earth without being destroyed send up their tufts of sprouts, which in a few years reach a height of seven or eight feet. It is this kind of tangled thicket that is called a mâquis. They are made up of different kinds of trees and shrubs, so crowded and mingled together at the caprice of nature that only with an axe in hand can a man open a passage through them, and mâquis are frequently seen so thick and bushy that the wild sheep themselves cannot penetrate them.",,,11/06/29,December 28th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Short Stories', 'France', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Literature', 'Read For School', 'School']",,9782080721044,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1419121326l/550694.jpg,3.68,[],70.0,1.0,,550694.Mateo_Falcone,,,,,85.0,634.0,95,,Flammarion,"['172', '201', '167', '71', '23']",,,[],,

Pyotr Kropotkin,Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution,,English,,"In this cornerstone of modern liberal social theory, Peter Kropotkin states that the most effective human and animal communities are essentially cooperative, rather than competitive. Kropotkin based this classic on his observations of natural phenomena and history, forming a work of stunning and well-reasoned scholarship. Essential to the understanding of human evolution as well as social organization, it offers a powerful counterpoint to the tenets of Social Darwinism. It also cites persuasive evidence of human nature's innate compatibility with anarchist society.""Kropotkin's basic argument is correct,"" noted evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. ""Struggle does occur in many modes, and some lead to cooperation among members of a species as the best pathway to advantage for individuals."" Anthropologist Ashley Montagu declared that ""Mutual Aid will never be any more out of date than will the Declaration of Independence. New facts may increasingly become available, but we can already see that they will serve largely to support Kropotkin's conclusion that 'in the ethical progress of man, mutual support—not mutual struggle—has had the leading part.'"" Physician and author Alex Comfort asserted that ""Kropotkin profoundly influenced human biology by his theory of Mutual Aid. . . . He was one of the first systematic students of animal communities, and may be regarded as the founder of modern social ecology.""",,,11/06/91,April 7th 2006,['Charles Darwin'],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Theory', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Classics', 'Anarchism', 'Political Science']",,9780486449135,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328863739l/925313.jpg,4.23,[],67.0,1.0,,925313.Mutual_Aid,,,,,97.0,1993.0,336,,Dover Publications,"['904', '720', '305', '49', '15']",,,[],,

Pythia Peay (Goodreads Author),American Icarus: A Memoir of Father and Country,,English,,"This is the story of Joe Carroll: fully paid-up member of the Greatest Generation, aviator, farmer, and handsome Irish charmer who radiated exuberance for life—a literal and metaphorical flying boy. With his head in the clouds, this American Icarus embodied all that was aspirational and attractive about mid-twentieth-century America, with its technical ingenuity, bravado, and its belief that the only way was up. But Joe was also a destructive, impulsive alcoholic; like many of that generation he held experiences and feelings close to the chest. Only on his deathbed did Joe acknowledge the pull of gravity, reaching out to his estranged family, reflecting over his life, and contemplating the afterlife.Depth journalist Pythia Peay is Joe’s eldest child. In this evocative, thoroughly researched, and sensitively drawn depiction of her father’s life and times, Peay maps the trajectories of this troubled, ordinary Joe, who as a youth had suffered a Dickensian twist of fate that would leave him a divided man. Guided by her father’s memories he recalled as he lay dying, Peay charts the ancestral rivers that led a working-class boy from depression-era Altoona, Pennsylvania, to the Air Transport Command and Brazil during World War II; post-War Buenos Aires, where Joe married an Argentine beauty with ancestral connections to the foundation of the United States; newly independent Israel, where he flew for El Al; the Missouri heartland in the 1950s, where he ran a farm and raised four children while traveling the world for TWA; the upheavals of the 1960s that would drive Peay and her father apart; Mexico, where her parents fled to escape their failing marriage; and, finally, Texas, where Joe got cancer and died.In narrating Joe’s life, Peay not only delineates the depths of the Depression, the highs of the “good war” and the psychological toll it exacted on the Greatest Generation, as well as the undercurrents that led to her family’s disintegration in the 1960s, but she unpacks the myths and archetypes that shape the United States—its perpetual restlessness and heroic individualism—in a journey that leads, intimately and movingly, to a final reconciliation with a dying patriarch and the ghosts of the past.",,,,April 14th 2015,[],Hardcover,[],,9781590564417,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429029825l/25358831.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,25358831-american-icarus,,,,,100.0,10.0,448,,Lantern Books,"['10', '0', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,
Pythia Peay (Goodreads Author),America on the Couch: Psychological Perspectives on American Politics and Culture,,English,,"What lies behind America’s historic romance with the gun? Why does it have such a troubled relationship with alcohol and drugs? Why is it so wedded to consumerism and so resistant to the evidence of climate change? What are its enduring myths about individuality, freedom, and independence, and how might we re-imagine our vision of the United States as the “Promised Land” and “The City on the Hill” to reflect a multiculturalism that offers “the last, best hope” for the world?In a two-decades long journey through the American psyche, depth journalist Pythia Peay has asked these and many more questions of no fewer than thirty-six of the world’s leading psychologists and psychoanalysts. From Robert Jay Lifton to Marion Woodman, A. Thomas McLellan to Judith V. Jordan, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi to June Singer, and James Hillman to Mary Pipher, the thinkers in America on the Couch discuss violence, addiction, the environment, capitalism and consumerism, politics and power, and the soul of America. The result is a uniquely comprehensive, wide-ranging, and compelling kaleidoscope of insights into the psychodynamics of a hegemon in peace and at war, as it confronts the shadows of the American century and charts its way into an uncertain, multi-polar future.Featuring:Stephen AizenstatJohn BeebeBonnie BrightGary S.

Python Bonkers,A Million Little Pieces of Feces,The Fake Memoir That's So Much More Fun Than James Frey's,,Fiction,"(Selected excerpts and outside reviews can be found by clicking on the blue Python Bonkers hyperlink.) This book may share an alphabetical lineage with the Frey book, but there is no melodramatic redemption here -- it is not a parody of that book but its own entity. As one of the characters from the book says, We're still involved in the commission of the acts that will require redemption -- and those stories are always so much more fun. Bonkers and his bizarre team embarks on a gonzo tear through the streets of Los Angeles and across the pop cultural landscape as well. In his satirical quest for truth in journalism, and life, he must navigate through the many odd tiers of social class, in both the Southern California culture and in his Machiavellian office life and its absurd red and blue political divisions. This is no heart-wrenching tale of excess, its destination is hilarity, so it presses the pedal to the metal and takes no prisoners.",,,,2006.0,,,,1411677315,9781411677319,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gkdqQv-aFnAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.55,,,,,,,,,,,,256.0,,,,42.0,,,,

"Péter Nádas, Imre Goldstein (Translation)",Parallel Stories: A Novel,,English,,"In 1989, the memorable year when the Wall came down, a university student in Berlin on his early morning run finds a corpse lying on a park bench and alerts the authorities. This classic police-procedural scene opens an extraordinary novel, a masterwork that traces the fate of myriad Europeans - Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Gypsies - across the treacherous years of the mid-twentieth century. The social and political circumstances of their lives may vary richly, their sexual and spiritual longings may seem to each of them entirely unique, yet Peter N das's magnificent tapestry unveils uncanny, reverberating parallels that link them across time and space.Three unusual men are at the heart of Parallel Stories: Hans von Wolkenstein, whose German mother is linked to dark secrets of fascist-Nazi collaboration during the 1940s, Agost Lippay-Lehr, whose influential father has served Hungary's different political regimes for decades, and Andras Rott, who has his own dark record of dark activities abroad. They are friends in Budapest when we eventually meet them in the spring of 1961, a pivotal time in the postwar epoch and in their clandestine careers. But the richly detailed, dramatic memories and actions of these men, like those of their friends, lovers and family members, range from Berlin and Moscow to Switzerland and Holland, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, and of course, across Hungary. The ever-daring, ever-original episodes of Parallel Lives explore the most intimate, most difficult human experiences in a prose glowing with uncommon clarity and also with mysterious uncertainty - as is characteristic of Nadas's subtle, spirited art.The web of extended dramas in Parallel Stories reaches not just forward to the transformative year of 1989 but back to the spring of 1939, with Europe trembling on the edge of war; to the bestial times of 1944-45, when Budapest was besieged, the final solution devastated Hungary's Jews, and the war came to an end; and to the cataclysmic Hungarian Revolution of October 1956. But there is much more to Parallel Stories than that: it is a daring, demanding, and very moving exploration of humanity at its most constrained and its most free.",,,10/30/05,November 27th 2012,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Hungary', 'Historical Fiction', 'Hungarian Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', '21st Century']",,9781250013903,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346671767l/13513468.jpg,3.71,"['Internationaler Literaturpreis – Haus der Kulturen der Welt Nominee (2012)', 'Independent Foreign Fiction Prize Nominee for Longlist (2012)', 'Brücke-Berlin-Preis (Brücke Berlin Literature and Translation Prize) for Christina Viragh (2012)']",97.0,1.0,,13513468-parallel-stories,,,,,82.0,414.0,1133,,Picador,"['142', '118', '79', '41', '34']",,,[],,
"Péter Nádas, Ivan Sanders (Translator), Imre Goldstein",A Book of Memories,,English,,"This extraordinary magnum opus seems at first to be a confessional autobiographical novel in the grand manner, claiming and extending the legacy of Proust and Mann. But it is more: Peter Nadas has given us a superb contemporary psychological novel that comes to terms with the ghosts, corpses, and repressed nightmares of Europe's recent past. ""A Book of Memories"" is made up of three first-person narratives: the first that of a young Hungarian writer and his fated love for a German poet; we also learn of the narrator's adolescence in Budapest, when he experiences the downfall of his once-upper-class but now pro-Communist family and of his beloved but repudiated father, a state prosecutor who commits suicide after the 1956 uprising. A second memoir, alternating with the first, is a novel the narrator is composing about a refined Belle Epoque aesthete, whose anti-bourgeois transgressions seem like emotionally overcharged versions of the narrator's own experiences. A third voice is that of a childhood friend who, after the narrator's return to his homeland, offers an apparently more objective account of their friendship.
