"T. Colin Campbell, Howard Jacobson",Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition,,English,,"What happens when you eat an apple? The answer is vastly more complex than you imagine.Every apple contains thousands of antioxidants whose names, beyond a few like vitamin C, are unfamiliar to us, and each of these powerful chemicals has the potential to play an important role in supporting our health. They impact thousands upon thousands of metabolic reactions inside the human body. But calculating the specific influence of each of these chemicals isn’t nearly sufficient to explain the effect of the apple as a whole. Because almost every chemical can affect every other chemical, there is an almost infinite number of possible biological consequences.And that’s just from an apple.Nutritional science, long stuck in a reductionist mindset, is at the cusp of a revolution. The traditional ""gold standard” of nutrition research has been to study one chemical at a time in an attempt to determine its particular impact on the human body. These sorts of studies are helpful to food companies trying to prove there is a chemical in milk or pre-packaged dinners that is ""good” for us, but they provide little insight into the complexity of what actually happens in our bodies or how those chemicals contribute to our health.In The China Study, T. Colin Campbell (alongside his son, Thomas M. Campbell) revolutionized the way we think about our food with the evidence that a whole food, plant-based diet is the healthiest way to eat. Now, in Whole, he explains the science behind that evidence, the ways our current scientific paradigm ignores the fascinating complexity of the human body, and why, if we have such overwhelming evidence that everything we think we know about nutrition is wrong, our eating habits haven’t changed.Whole is an eye-opening, paradigm-changing journey through cutting-edge thinking on nutrition, a scientific tour de force with powerful implications for our health and for our world.",,,,May 7th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Health', 'Nonfiction', 'Nutrition', 'Food', 'Science', 'Vegan', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Reference', 'Diets']",,9781937856243,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379393042l/13587039.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Food & Cookbooks (2013)'],97.0,1.0,,13587039-whole,,,,,90.0,5150.0,352,,BenBella Books,"['1826', '1695', '1130', '372', '127']",,,[],,

Dover, Massachusetts, 1969. Ginny Richardson's heart was torn open when her baby girl, Lucy, born with Down Syndrome, was taken from her. Under pressure from his powerful family, her husband, Ab, sent Lucy away to Willowridge, a special school for the “feeble-minded."" Ab tried to convince Ginny it was for the best. That they should grieve for their daughter as though she were dead. That they should try to move on. But two years later, when Ginny's best friend, Marsha, shows her a series of articles exposing Willowridge as a hell-on-earth--its squalid hallways filled with neglected children--she knows she can't leave her daughter there.

T. Harv Eker,Secrets of the Millionaire Mind: Mastering the Inner Game of Wealth,,,,"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind reveals the missing link between wanting success and achieving it!Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: ""Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!"" Eker does this by identifying your ""money and success blueprint."" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and ""revise"" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen ""Wealth Files,"" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!",,First Edition,,February 15th 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Finance', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Money', 'Personal Development', 'Personal Finance', 'Psychology', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Audiobook']",,9780060763282,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347940515l/785092.jpg,4.21,[],186.0,2.0,,785092.Secrets_of_the_Millionaire_Mind,,,,,94.0,43774.0,212,,Harper Collins Business,"['21831', '12472', '6933', '1692', '846']",,,[],,

Hate never felt so good.  I first met Tristan Miles at a meeting where he was trying to take over my late husband’s company. He was powerful, arrogant, and infuriatingly gorgeous, and I hated him with every cell in my body. In the shock of the century, he called me three days later and asked me on a date. I would rather die than date a man like him—though I do have to admit it was good for the ego. Turning him down was the highlight of my year. Six months later, he was the guest speaker at a conference I attended in France. Still arrogant and infuriating—but this time, surprisingly charming and witty. When he looked at me, I got butterflies. But I can’t go there. He’s just a player in a hot suit, and I’m just a widow with three unruly sons. I just need this conference to be over.

Eliot's insights into the cyclical nature of life are revealed through themes and images woven throughout the four poems. Spiritual, philosophical, and personal themes emerge through symbolic allusions and literary and religious references from both Eastern and Western thought. The work addresses the connections of the personal and historical present and past, spiritual renewal, and the very nature of experience; it is considered the poet's clearest exposition of his Christian beliefs.

When a rare beauty shows up at his door and offers to keep his animal steady for two hundred bucks a week, well, he’s mighty tempted to pay to prolong his life.

T.S. Joyce (Goodreads Author),Son of the Dragon,,English,,"Deep in a high security shifter prison dwells the most dangerous shifter in the world. Vyr Daye is the Red Dragon, alpha to the Sons of Beasts Crew, loner, watcher, fire-breather…and he’s also completely misunderstood. The media has dragged him through the mud, his reputation is shot, and his own father helped to put him in prison for a one-year sentence. Only this prison isn’t what it seems and he’s fighting to keep his dragon alive. All he needs to do is keep steady for six more months and then he can live his life as quietly as possible with his crew, but one sexy, fast-talking prison counselor saunters in and wrecks his focus. Riyah isn’t what she seems, but no one can sense her powers besides Vyr. He’ll keep her secrets if she keeps his. And as the dragon inside of him starts losing his battle, he’ll need her help to gather his crew and pull him from the brink before it’s too late. And the more he gets to know the beguiling woman, the more he thinks she’s here for more important reasons than even he understands.  Riyah Mercer has been hired to infiltrate the shifter prison and watch Vyr’s back. He doesn’t trust her, but he doesn’t realize she is his only friend here. She can see him struggling, and can see the dragon fading. As she starts falling hard for the stoic man, she becomes determined to do anything to save him. But saving the dragon means unleashing his fire on the world, and that’s not the only danger Riyah is in. There are eyes everywhere in the prison and they are creating something monstrous down in the cell where they keep the Red Dragon. If she is caught helping the man she’s falling in love with, it could mean the end for them both.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets.

A broken mating bond has him going insane, and all he can do is try to hold onto his Alpha position as long as possible. But when a spirited beauty comes waltzing into his MC’s clubhouse demanding an audience with him, he can’t help but think he’s dreaming her up. She’s got paperwork saying he’s her mate, and this shifter has one serious stubborn streak in her. All he wants to do is go insane in peace, but she isn’t having it. And now the real work begins. He’s got to sever one mating bond completely if he wants a shot at survival. And if this crazy plan works, he might just have a second shot at happiness too.  Vina wants a crow.

And the more Vina gets to know him, the more she thinks it wasn’t him who signed up for a mate after all.  And now Vina has two choices—cut and run from the storm coming for the Red Dead Mayhem Clan, or dig her heels in and rip that old mating bond out of Ramsey. Up until now, no one has appreciated her, but what if…just what if…she could be the one to save the crows?

T.W. Rolleston,Celtic Myths and Legends,,English,,"This splendidly illustrated study by the distinguished Celticist T. W. Rolleston masterfully retells the great Celtic myths and illuminates the world that spawned them. Focusing principally on Irish myths, the book first takes up the history and religion of the Celts, the myths of the Irish invasion and the early Milesian kings.What follows is pure enchantment as you enter the timeless world of heroic tales centered around the Ulster king Conor mac Nessa and the Red Branch Order of chivalry (Ultonian cycle). These are followed by the tales of the Ossianic cycle, which center on the figure of Finn mac Cumhal, whose son Oisín (or Ossian) was a poet and warrior, and the traditional author of most of the tales. Next comes a summary of the Voyage of Maeldūn, a brilliant and curious piece of invention that exemplifies the genre of ""wonder-voyages"" — adventures purely in the region of romance, out of earthly space and time. Finally, the author recounts a selection of the myths and tales of the Cymry (Welsh).In these pages, readers will delight in the favorite and familiar tales of Cuchulain, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the Grail, Deirdre, and many more figures that haunt the shadowy, twilight world of Celtic legend. The magic of that world is further brought to life in more than 50 imaginative full-page illustrations by Stephen Reid, Arthur G. Bell, and the famed illustrator J. C. Leyendecker. Reprinted here in its first paperback edition, Celtic Myths and Legends also includes several helpful genealogical tables: Gods of the House of Dōn, Gods of the House of Llyr, and Arthur and His Kin, as well as a useful glossary.",,,10/30/11,November 1st 1990,[],Paperback,"['Mythology', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Folklore', 'Reference', 'Ireland', 'Classics', 'Fairy Tales', 'Irish Literature', 'Religion']",,9780486265070,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416873340l/839793.jpg,3.93,[],111.0,2.0,,839793.Celtic_Myths_and_Legends,,,,,93.0,2633.0,528,,Dover Publications,"['914', '844', '703', '122', '50']",,,[],,

Ta-Nehisi Coates,Between the World and Me,,English,,"“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.",,,,July 14th 2015,['Ta-Nehisi Coates'],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Biography', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Politics', 'African American']",,9780812993547,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451435027l/25489625._SY475_.jpg,4.39,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2016)', 'National Book Award for Nonfiction (2015)', 'ALA Alex Award (2016)', 'PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay  (2016)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Criticism (2015)', 'NAIBA Book of the Year for Nonfiction (2016)', 'Kirkus Prize for Nonfiction (2015)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2015)']",2004.0,23.0,,25489625-between-the-world-and-me,,,,,96.0,235339.0,152,,Spiegel & Grau,"['136056', '69174', '20504', '5880', '3725']",,,['United States of America'],,

Tabitha King,One on One,,English,,"A small-town school in western Maine, milltown Greenspark has a single claim to fame: its high school basketball team. A hero on the court, senior Sam Styles has led Greenspark Academy to three consecutive state championships. He has become an off-court mover-and-shaker as well, and he sends a shockwave through the school's social hierarchy when he decides that capping his own high school career with a fourth victory will not be enough: he wants the girls' team to win one, too. Standing between the girls and that state trophy is the person who is also their best hope of gaining it, a sophomore known as the Mutant, a/k/a Deanie Gauthier. She is attitude incarnate, a quicksilver playmaker on the court and a defiant pariah off it, as disliked as Sam is popular. If the girls are going to go all the way, Sam realizes, he will have to straighten her out. Saving Deanie from herself is no easy task, however. Behind the wild, tough girl, Sam discovers an unexpected soul mate, and he isn't prepared for the volatile, disturbing relationship that ignites between them and cuts radically across the grain of Greenspark's traditions. He wants her to take her team to the championships; she wants to take him where he's never been before. They both get more than they bargain for - Deanie must surrender the secrets shielded by her Mutant facade, and Sam must take on their burden. It is an exchange that will transform both their lives. One on One is a remarkably engaging story of sexual initiation and awakening into love, of how growing up breaks and remakes family, of an adolescent culture that makes its own rules and enforces them its own way. It is the story of a season full of pain and triumph, injury and healing, when the lives of two vividly realized human beings fatefully entwine.

The first products were brief: the biography of his late father-in-law Julius Agricola and an account of Rome's most dangerous enemies, the Germans.

Tad Williams (Goodreads Author),Shadowplay,,English,,"A year ago, the March Kingdoms were at peace, the Eddon family held the throne, and all was right in Southmarch Castle and the north of the world. Now the family has been shattered. King Olin Eddon is a prisoner in a faraway land. Olin's heir Kendrick is dead - slain by treachery and dark, bloody magic - and Kendric's younger brother and sister have barely escaped several attempts on their own lives. With their father and brother taken from them, the royal twins Barrick and Briony have done their best to hold the kingdom together, but now Barrick has been captured in a failed war against the immortal Twilight People and Briony has been forced to flee the castle. Everywhere in the north the fierce Twilight People, led by the ageless warrior-witch Yasammez, hold sway. Old magics are stirring beneath the ancient castle and behind the Shadowline, and the machinations of gods, fairies, and mortals threaten to spread devastation across the entire world. Meanwhile, the Autarch, the insane god-king of the southern continent, has set in motion his plan to bring the entire northern world - and most especially Southmarch Castle - under his way. Behind the Shadowline, Prince Barrick Eddon of Southmarch is lost and spellbound in the land of the fairies. Though he has barely begun to uncover the strange secrets of his own past, Barrick must also solve the mystery of his even stranger destiny - a destiny which will lead him to places no man has ever gone and force him to take on a burden even the greatest hero couldn't bear - preserving the lives of all humans and fairy-folk. As she flees Southmarch, Princess Briony finds both allies and deadly enemies in unexpected places far from the land of her birth. In her quest to survive and win back her family's throne she encounters spies and murderers, traveling players and ancient gods. During their desperate journeys the twins discover that even a land's rulers may know little of its true history, and that both families and nations can hide dark and terrible secrets. But even if Barrick and Briony survive learning the astonishing truths at the heart of their own family and of Southmarch itself, they must still find a way to do the impossible - they must reclaim their kingdom and rescue their home and people from a multitude of powerful enemies - from traitors, tyrants, a god-king, and even the angry gods themselves.",Shadowmarch #2,,01/01/07,March 6th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Epic', 'Science Fiction', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Novels']",,9780756403584,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442582884l/28687._SX318_.jpg,3.9,[],185.0,3.0,,28687.Shadowplay,,,,,96.0,7258.0,656,,Daw Books,"['1902', '3105', '1931', '266', '54']",,,[],,

In many ways it is humankind's most stunning achievement: a private, multidimensional universe built over two generations by the greatest minds of the twenty-first century. But this most exclusive of places is also one of the world's best kept secrets, created and controlled by an organization made up of the world's most powerful and ruthless individuals, a private cartel known--to those who know of their existence at all--as The Grail Brotherhood. Though their purpose in creating Otherland is still a mystery, it may not remain so for long. For they have exacted a terrible price from humanity in the process, and even their highly organized global conspiracy cannot hide the nature of their crimes forever.

Already the father of seven daughters, Hajji Ahmed determines that his eighth child will be a male. Accordingly, the infant, a girl, is named Mohammed Ahmed and raised as a young man with all the privileges granted exclusively to men in traditional Arab-Islamic societies. As she matures, however, Ahmed's desire to have children marks the beginning of her sexual evolution, and as a woman named Zahra, Ahmed begins to explore her true sexual identity. Drawing on the rich Arabic oral tradition, Ben Jelloun relates the extraordinary events of Ahmed's life through a professional storyteller and the listeners who have gathered in a Marrakesh market square in the 1950s to hear his tale.

Tahir Shah (Goodreads Author),The Caliph's House: A Year in Casablanca,,English,,"In the tradition of A Year in Provence and Under the Tuscan Sun, acclaimed English travel writer Tahir Shah shares a highly entertaining account of making an exotic dream come true. By turns hilarious and harrowing, here is the story of his family’s move from the gray skies of London to the sun-drenched city of Casablanca, where Islamic tradition and African folklore converge–and nothing is as easy as it seems….Inspired by the Moroccan vacations of his childhood, Tahir Shah dreamed of making a home in that astonishing country. At age thirty-six he got his chance. Investing what money he and his wife, Rachana, had, Tahir packed up his growing family and bought Dar Khalifa, a crumbling ruin of a mansion by the sea in Casablanca that once belonged to the city’s caliph, or spiritual leader.With its lush grounds, cool, secluded courtyards, and relaxed pace, life at Dar Khalifa seems sure to fulfill Tahir’s fantasy–until he discovers that in many ways he is farther from home than he imagined. For in Morocco an empty house is thought to attract jinns, invisible spirits unique to the Islamic world. The ardent belief in their presence greatly hampers sleep and renovation plans, but that is just the beginning. From elaborate exorcism rituals involving sacrificial goats to dealing with gangster neighbors intent on stealing their property, the Shahs must cope with a new culture and all that comes with it. Endlessly enthralling, The Caliph’s House charts a year in the life of one family who takes a tremendous gamble. As we follow Tahir on his travels throughout the kingdom, from Tangier to Marrakech to the Sahara, we discover a world of fierce contrasts that any true adventurer would be thrilled to call home.From the Hardcover edition.See for an interview: http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/vide...",,,01/01/06,December 26th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Morocco', 'Memoir', 'Africa', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Islam', 'Adventure', 'Cultural']",,9780553383102,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320485351l/131011.jpg,3.97,[],76.0,1.0,,131011.The_Caliph_s_House,,,,,94.0,6113.0,349,,Bantam,"['2003', '2394', '1330', '287', '99']",,,[],,

Tai Moses (Goodreads Author),Zooburbia: Meditations on the Wild Animals Among Us,,,,"To be alienated from animals is to live a life that is not quite whole, contends nature writer Tai Moses in Zooburbia. Urban and suburban residents share our environments with many types of wildlife: squirrels, birds, spiders, and increasingly lizards, deer, and coyote. Many of us crave more contact with wild creatures, and recognize the small and large ways animals enrich our lives, yet don’t notice the animals already around us.Zooburbia reveals the reverence that can be felt in the presence of animals and shows how that reverence connects us to a deeper, better part of ourselves. A lively blend of memoir, natural history, and mindfulness practices, Zooburbia makes the case for being mindful and compassionate stewards — and students — of the wildlife with whom we coexist. With lessons on industriousness, perseverance, presence, exuberance, gratitude, aging, how to let go, and much more, Tai's vignettes share the happy fact that none of us is alone — our teachers are right in front of us. We need only go outdoors to find a rapport with the animal kingdom. Zooburbia is a magnifying lens turned to our everyday environment.",,,05/13/14,May 20th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Nature', 'Animals', 'Wildlife', 'Memoir']",,9781937006679,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385599920l/18406704.jpg,4.1,[],92.0,1.0,,18406704-zooburbia,,,,,93.0,135.0,272,,Parallax Press,"['60', '40', '26', '7', '2']",,,[],,

The news of Kweku’s death sends a ripple around the world, bringing together the family he abandoned years before. Ghana Must Go is their story. Electric, exhilarating, beautifully crafted, Ghana Must Go is a testament to the transformative power of unconditional love, from a debut novelist of extraordinary talent.  Moving with great elegance through time and place, Ghana Must Go charts the Sais’ circuitous journey to one another.

Splintered, alone, each navigates his pain, believing that what has been lost can never be recovered—until, in Ghana, a new way forward, a new family, begins to emerge.Ghana Must Go is at once a portrait of a modern family, and an exploration of the importance of where we come from to who we are.

Shuichi Nitori and his new friend Yoshino Takatsuki have happy homes, loving families, and are well-liked by their classmates. But they share a secret that further complicates a time of life that is awkward for anyone: Shuichi is a boy who wants to be a girl, and Yoshino is a girl who wants to be a boy.

"Takashi Hiraide, Eric Selland (Translator)",The Guest Cat,,English,,"A bestseller in France and winner of Japan’s Kiyama Shohei Literary Award, The Guest Cat, by the acclaimed poet Takashi Hiraide, is a subtly moving and exceptionally beautiful novel about the transient nature of life and idiosyncratic but deeply felt ways of living. A couple in their thirties live in a small rented cottage in a quiet part of Tokyo; they work at home, freelance copy-editing; they no longer have very much to say to one another. But one day a cat invites itself into their small kitchen. It leaves, but the next day comes again, and then again and again. Soon they are buying treats for the cat and enjoying talks about the animal and all its little ways. Life suddenly seems to have more promise for the husband and wife — the days have more light and color. The novel brims with new small joys and many moments of staggering poetic beauty, but then something happens….As Kenzaburo Oe has remarked, Takashi Hiraide’s work ""really shines."" His poetry, which is remarkably cross-hatched with beauty, has been acclaimed here for ""its seemingly endless string of shape-shifting objects and experiences,whose splintering effect is enacted via a unique combination of speed and minutiae.""",,,10/30/01,January 28th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Cats', 'Contemporary', 'Animals', 'Asia', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asian Literature']",,9780811221504,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1363582979l/17574849.jpg,3.53,[],178.0,2.0,,17574849-the-guest-cat,,,,,87.0,16689.0,140,,New Directions,"['2599', '6136', '5842', '1752', '360']",,,['Tokyo (Japan)'],,

Takeo Doi,The Anatomy of Dependence,,English,,"A classic study of the Japanese psyche, a starting point for a true understanding Japanese behavior....The discovery that a major concept of human feeling-easily expressed in everyday Japanese- totally resisted translation into a Western language led Dr. Takeo Doi to explore and define an area of the psyche which has previously received little attention. The resulting essay, The Anatomy of Dependence, is one of the most penetrating analyses of the Japanese mind ever written, as well as an important original contribution to psychology which transcends the boundaries of cultures and nations.Published in Japan as Amae no Kozo (The Structure of Amae), Dr. Doi's work is focused upon the word ""amae"" (indulgence) and its related vocabulary. Expressive of an emotion central to the Japanese experience, ""amae"" refers to the indulging, passive love which surrounds and supports the individual in a group, whether family, neighborhood, or the world at large. Considering the lack of such words in Western languages, Dr. Doi suggests inherent differences between the two cultures-contrasting the ideal of self-reliance with those of interdependence and the indulgence of weaknesses. Yet, he finds that Western audiences have no difficulty in recognizing and identifying with the emotions he describes, and are even searching for a way to express this need.While there is no doubt that the concept of ""amae"" is more developed in Japan and the feelings it engenders more profound, Dr. Doi's work is widely recognized as having a universal application.

  We sniff our knickers; we bite our own toenails; we laboriously dig out ingrown hairs: Women aren't as ladylike as people would like to imagine. Using anecdotes collected from hundreds of anonymous sources, this gleefully disgusting illustrated book rewrites our definition of femininity. 
One day, the artist Tallulah Pomeroy overhead a conversation between two girls about another friend of theirs they knew in college. Apparently, when this friend had been on tour with the rugby team, she'd drunkenly 'done a shit in the sink.' 'She's not a girl if she did that,' said one to the other. 'She may have a vagina, but she's not a girl.'This exchange made Tallulah laugh, but it also made her think. How many things had her friends done that meant they 'weren't girls?' She made a Facebook group and asked people to submit stories about their 'unladylike' behaviors. The page was soon flooded with more stories than she could have ever imagined: about ear wax and trapped wind, gray pubes and bloody pajamas. It became a community of honest, funny, and supportive women, who, by admitting to things they'd thought were shameful, no longer had to feel ashamed.For A Girl's Guide to Personal Hygiene, Tallulah made original illustrations to accompany a selection of those Facebook posts—plus dozens more from an expanded call for submissions—to create an exuberant and galvanizing handbook for all the nasty women of the world.",,,,February 1st 2018,[],Kindle Edition,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Graphic Novels', 'Humor', 'Comics']",,B071LC1N2R,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511759937l/36119084.jpg,3.68,[],90.0,1.0,,36119084-a-girl-s-guide-to-personal-hygiene,,,,,84.0,151.0,112,,Soft Skull Press,"['42', '47', '38', '19', '5']",,,[],,

Wise beyond her age yet imbued with child-like innocence, Gracie focuses on the three things that keep her awake at night:1. Solving the mystery of the man in the gray house;2. Surviving another school year at Savage Crossing Elementary; and,3. Saving her alcoholic Daddy from himself (and thereby saving the whole family and wider world).Gracie feels certain there is more to life beyond school and dull church sermons.

Redemption secures the life of the people as a community, not just as individuals. In this story, Boaz fills the familial obligation to marry the widow of a deceased relative who never was able to father children, both to continue the family line and protect an otherwise vulnerable woman.The authors provide a critical, line-by-line commentary of the biblical text, presented in its original Hebrew, complete with vocalization and cantillation marks, as well as the 1985 JPS English translation. The extensive introduction places the book within its historical, literary, and critical context, discusses contemporary interpretations of the story of Ruth, and examines its major motifs and themes, among them: family, marriage and levirate marriage in biblical and ancient Israel, redemption and inheritance, hesed, and the book’s connection with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.",,,,July 6th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Religion', 'Reference']",,9780827607446,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344675039l/10383217.jpg,4.33,[],93.0,1.0,,10383217-the-jps-bible-commentary,,,,,96.0,24.0,216,,The Jewish Publication Society,"['12', '9', '2', '1', '0']",,,[],,

Tami Hoag (Goodreads Author),Kill the Messenger,,English,,"With this new thriller, The New York Times bestselling author Tami Hoag delivers her own message to suspense fans everywhere: Don't turn off the lights, and keep reading if you dare. From the gritty streets of Los Angeles to its most protected enclaves of prestige and power to the ruthless glamour of Hollywood, a killer stalks his prey. A killer so merciless no one in his way is safe—not even the innocent.At the end of a long day battling street traffic, bike messenger Jace Damon has one last drop to make. But en route to delivering a package for one of L.A.'s sleaziest defense attorneys, he's nearly run down by a car, chased through back alleys, and shot at. Only the instincts acquired while growing up on the streets of L.A. allow him to escape with his life—and with the package someone wants badly enough to kill for. Jace returns to Lenny Lowell's office only to find the cops there, the lawyer dead, and Jace himself considered the prime suspect in the savage murder. Suddenly he's on the run from both the cops and a killer, and the key to saving himself and his ten-year-old brother is the envelope he still has—which holds a message no one wants delivered: the truth.In a city fueled by money, celebrity, and sensationalism, the murder of a bottom-feeding mouthpiece like Lenny Lowell won't make the headlines. So when detectives from the LAPD's elite robbery/homicide division show up, homicide detective Kev Parker wants to know why. Parker is on the downhill slide of a once-promising career, and he doesn't want to be reminded that he used to be one of the hotshots, working cases that made instant celebrities of everyone involved. Like the case of fading retty-boy actor Rob Cole, accused of the brutal murder of his wife, Tricia Crowne-Cole, daughter of one of the most powerful men in the city, L.A.'s latest ""crime of the century.""Robbery/Homicide has no reason to be looking at a dead small-time scumbag lawyer or chasing a bike messenger...unless there's something in it for them. Maybe Lenny Lowell had a connection to something big enough to be killed for. Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer—or the end of his career. Because if there's one lesson he's learned over the years, it's that in a town built on fantasy and fame, delivering the truth can be deadly.",,,07/06/04,February 28th 2006,"['Jace Damon', 'Kev Parker']",Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Murder Mystery']",,9780553583588,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320483123l/84843.jpg,3.84,[],58.0,1.0,,84843.Kill_the_Messenger,,,,,94.0,8722.0,528,,Bantam,"['2259', '3485', '2415', '462', '101']",,,"['Los Angeles area, California (United States)']",,

They're tough, they're capable, and they're none too happy about the indignity of being saddled with a puppy for the first time in years. What they don't know is that Beka has something unique to offer. Never much of a talker, Beka is a good listener. So good, in fact, that she hears things that Mattes and Clary never could - information that is passed in murmurs when flocks of pigeons gather ... murmurs that are the words of the dead.In this way, Beka learns of someone in the Lower City who has overturned the power structure of the underworld and is terrorizing its citizens into submission and silence. Beka's magical listening talent is the only way for the Provost's Dogs to find out the identity of this brutal new underlord, for the dead are beyond fear. And the ranks of the dead will be growing if the Dogs can't stop a crime wave the likes of which has never been seen.

With her mother, the lady knight Alanna, forever being summoned to some crisis or other, and the young men of Tortall little more than diversions, Aly is bored and restless. Her father is second-in-command of the country's spies- of only he would let her be one! The former king of thieves, he had trained her in the arts of espionage and knows that she is capable of taking care of herself. But he won't risk losing his only daughter to the dangers of the field, so she spends her time helping him decode messages and dyeing her hair blue.But everything changes when Aly, sailing alone down the coast of Tortall, is captured by pirates and winds up a slave to the Balitangs, a kindly noble family of the Copper Isles. Years of lessons in the Isles' history have prepared her for their dual cultures- those of luarin, or white, conquerors and those of the brown-skinned, or raka, natives. Fueled by prophecies of a twice-royal queen who will free them, the rakas' resentment keeps the realm in constant turmoil. But Aly is no weeping captive; she's determined to free herself.Enter Kyprioth, patron god of the Isles, also known as Trickster, who is looking to shift the balance of power back to his raka worshipers. Aly makes a deal with the god: she will use her own trickster gifts to keep the Balitang children, especially the two teenage girls, safe through the summer. In exchange, Kyprioth will give her magical assistance in the form of spying crows and knowledge of events at court- and eventually, her freedom. But deals with gods are never simple matters; she doesn't count on becoming personally involved in the raka revolt, or with an unusual young man who has his own plans for Aly. ...",Daughter of the Lioness #1-2,,01/01/05,March 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Romance']",,9780739451458,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328047606l/153798.jpg,4.57,[],108.0,2.0,,153798.Tricksters,,,,,99.0,4394.0,590,,SFBC,"['2957', '1052', '326', '55', '4']",,,[],,

But he had his sights set on a lot more. He and his girl, Rosie Daly, were all set to run away to London together, get married, get good jobs, break away from factory work and poverty and their old lives.But on the winter night when they were supposed to leave, Rosie didn't show. Frank took it for granted that she'd given him the brush-off--probably because of his alcoholic father, nutcase mother, and generally dysfunctional family. He never went home again.Neither did Rosie. Everyone thought she had gone to England on her own and was over there living a shiny new life. Then, twenty-two years later, Rosie's suitcase shows up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place, and Frank is going home whether he likes it or not.Getting sucked in is a lot easier than getting out again. Frank finds himself straight back in the dark tangle of relationships he left behind. The cops working the case want him out of the way, in case loyalty to his family and community makes him a liability. Faithful Place wants him out because he’s a detective now, and the Place has never liked cops.

Tanya Huff,An Ancient Peace,,English,,"The first book of a thrilling new military science fiction spin-off of Tanya Huff's Confederation series.Gunnery Sergeant Torin Kerr had been the very model of a Confederation Marine. But when she learned the truth about the war the Confederation was fighting, she left the military for good.But Torin couldn’t walk away from preserving and protecting everything the Confederation represented. Instead, she drew together an elite corps of friends and allies to take on covert missions that the Justice Department and the Corps could not—or would not—officially touch. Torin just hoped the one they were about to embark on wouldn’t be the death of them.Ancient H’san grave goods are showing up on the black market—grave goods from just before the formation of the Confederation, when the H’san gave up war and buried their planet-destroying weapons…as grave goods for the death of war. Someone is searching for these weapons and they’re very close to finding them. As the Elder Races have turned away from war, those searchers can only be members of the Younger Races.Fortunately, only the Corps Intelligence Service has this information. Unfortunately, they can do nothing about it—bound by laws of full disclosure, their every move is monitored.Though Torin Kerr and her team are no longer a part of the military, the six of them tackling the H’san defenses and the lethally armed grave robbers are the only chance the Confederation has.

The Mafia had been demanding the same thing for six months, ""What is your real name?"" And the psychologists asked the question they always ask, ""Why?"" It’s the why of it that will keep a girl in trouble. Assuming Names is the true story of a young con artist.

I mention it at the front of the book but it may be easy to overlook, so I am reiterating here.At my website are copies of the newspaper and magazine articles mentioned in the book. The articles are from the Austin American Statesman, The Dallas Morning News, and Woman’s World Magazine. They are all nationally recognized media for news. Previous reviewers were concerned I may have gone to Photoshop to create them, and while my book does paint me as the sort that would do such a thing, the reality is that those media institutions would sue me into submission before the cache could be cleared.

Taona Dumisani Chiveneko (Goodreads Author),The Hangman's Replacement: Sprout of Disruption,,English,,"SYNOPSISZimbabwe’s last hangman retired in 2004. As the nation drifted towards abolition, no determined effort was made to find a replacement. However, the discovery of carnivorous flame lilies at the Great Zimbabwe monument triggered a spirited search for a new executioner. Those who know why this discovery energized the recruitment effort refused to talk.The frantic attempts to find a new hangman were impeded by the lack of suitable candidates. Well-placed sources confirmed that the fear of ‘ngozi’ was a deterrent. According to this traditional belief, the spirit of a murdered person torments the killer and his family for generations. However, this is only half the story. Several promising applicants did come forward. None met the minimum requirements for the job. The selection criteria were designed to exclude the mentally ill, the vindictive, and the sadistic. However, they did not rule out the desperate.The Sprout of Disruption (Book 1) is told through the shifting perspectives of characters whose lives have been set alight by the plant which sparked the recruitment effort. The parallel threads of the story converge around the aspiring hangman who was obsessed with securing the job, the sympathizers who fought to protect him from his prize, and the anxious men who believed that emptying death row would end their horror before the carnivorous plants constricted around their necks.KIRKUS REVIEW EXTRACT""At nearly 500 pages, this intricately woven novel is a disconcerting parable exploded to epic proportions. The author renders its many characters, from the mad genius responsible for the impending botanical apocalypse, to the prostitute/undercover operative who falls in love with Abel, to the seemingly simple Abel himself, with frightening subtlety and detail.... A thought-provoking, singularly strange and absorbing novel.""Link to full review: http://bit.ly/12ibxdU INDIEREADER REVIEW EXTRACTS“This is a work of completely bizarre genius. The author has an almost Wodehousian gift with words, decorating his pages with phrases that can make the reader laugh out loud, question long-held assumptions about reality, or send a chill up the spine with just a few deft descriptive touches. Some of the characters, and the situations they find themselves in, can be completely off-the-wall, but the author’s writing ability carefully makes them almost plausible, even natural.""“This is a delightful book for those who enjoy having their perspectives stretched, who take delight in the weird and idiosyncratic, and who love watching a master author do breathtaking juggling acts with the English language.""Link to full review: http://bit.ly/11Jdbd5SELF-PUBLISHING REVIEW EXTRACTS“Yet more than once as I laughed my way through this novel, I was reminded of a quotation by Nikolai Gogol that I came across recently: “The longer and more carefully we look at a funny story, the sadder it becomes.” The humor in The Hangman’s Replacement makes us laugh perhaps to keep us from crying. Again like Saramago, Chiveneko uses bizarre situations and sometimes subtle humor to deliver very deep and often disturbing social and political commentary. I think I would have appreciated the book more if I knew more about Zimbabwe’s history, but even lacking specific knowledge that might have turned story into allegory, I couldn’t help but feel the occasional chill as tragically universal themes emerged.”“Chiveneko is a talented writer. Beautiful metaphors and delightful descriptions, while sometimes a little overdone, are some of the best parts of the book.”“The Hangman’s Replacement is a long, complex, and challenging novel. But it rewards the reader’s efforts with delightful characters and plenty of laughter, even in the midst of some very disturbing themes.”Link to full review: http://bit.ly/1bWQcwQ",The Hangman's Replacement #1,First Edition,,January 15th 2013,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Africa', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'African Literature', 'Cultural', 'Fantasy', 'Adult Fiction', 'Horror']",,9780991852444,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361593130l/17409163.jpg,3.69,[],99.0,1.0,,17409163-the-hangman-s-replacement,,,,,82.0,194.0,492,,"Chiveneko Publishing Inc,","['58', '60', '41', '28', '7']",,,[],,

Tara Westover (Goodreads Author),Educated,,English,,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",,,,February 20th 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']",,9780399590504,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg,4.47,"['Audie Award for Best Female Narrator (2019)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Biography (2018)', 'ALA Alex Award (2019)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Longlist (2019)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)', 'PEN/Jean Stein Book Award Nominee for Shortlist (2019)', 'Reading Women Award for Nonfiction (2018)']",3826.0,42.0,,35133922-educated,,,,,98.0,796019.0,334,,Random House,"['477689', '236894', '62027', '12742', '6667']",,,"['Idaho Mountains (United States)', 'Idaho (United States)', 'Arizona (United States)', 'Rome (Italy)', 'Paris (France)', 'Palmyra, New York (United States)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Cambridge, England (United Kingdom)']",,

Tariq Ramadan,In the Footsteps of the Prophet: Lessons from the Life of Muhammad,,English,,"Named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important innovators of the century, Tariq Ramadan is a leading Muslim scholar, with a large following especially among young European and American Muslims. Now, in his first book written for a wide audience, he offers a marvelous biography of the Prophet Muhammad, one that highlights the spiritual and ethical teachings of one of the most influential figures in human history.In the Footsteps of the Prophet is a fresh and perceptive look at Muhammad, capturing a life that was often eventful, gripping, and highly charged. Ramadan provides both an intimate portrait of a man who was shy, kind, but determined, as well as a dramatic chronicle of a leader who launched a great religion and inspired a vast empire. More important, Ramadan presents the main events of the Prophet's life in a way that highlights his spiritual and ethical teachings. The book underscores the significance of the Prophet's example for some of today's most controversial issues, such as the treatment of the poor, the role of women, Islamic criminal punishments, war, racism, and relations with other religions. Selecting those facts and stories from which we can draw a profound and vivid spiritual picture, the author asks how can the Prophet's life remain -- or become again -- an example, a model, and an inspiration? And how can Muslims move from formalism -- a fixation on ritual -- toward a committed spiritual and social presence?In this thoughtful and engaging biography, Ramadan offers Muslims a new understanding of Muhammad's life and he introduces non-Muslims not just to the story of the Prophet, but to the spiritual and ethical riches of Islam.",,,,February 1st 2007,['Mohammad and his family'],Hardcover,"['Islam', 'Religion', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Theology', 'Self Help', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780195308808,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387739361l/169338.jpg,4.43,[],96.0,1.0,,169338.In_the_Footsteps_of_the_Prophet,,,,,96.0,3810.0,242,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['2352', '954', '366', '84', '54']",,,[],,
Tariq Ramadan,Muhammad: Vie Du Prophète: Les Enseignements Spirituels Et Contemporains,,French,,"Le Prophète occupe une place unique dans la conscience et la vie des musulmans. Il est l'Envoyé de Dieu, celui qui a reçu et transmis le Coran. Il n'est pourtant pas un médiateur : Muhammad ne fut qu'un homme, qui a transformé le monde à la lumière des révélations et des inspirations qui lui sont parvenues de l'Unique.Cette humanité assumée, élue et inspirée fait de lui un modèle pour les fidèles d'aujourd'hui. Son parcours renvoie aux questions premières et éternelles : sa vie est une invite à l'humilité, à la fraternité, au respect, à la justice et à la paix. Mais aussi, et surtout, à l'amour. C'est pourquoi le souffle de la Révélation porte un enseignement utile à tous les hommes, qu'ils soient ou non musulmans.Humanité, exemplarité : telles sont les deux dimensions à travers lesquelles Tariq Ramadan restitue la figure fondatrice de l'islam. S'appuyant sur les sources les plus fiables, il restitue le parcours et les actions de Muhammad, accompa­gnant son récit de réflexions sur le sens profond de cette vie. Parce qu'il souligne l'actualité de la parole du Prophète, ce livre est également une introduction privilégiée à l'islam.Tariq Ramadan, professeur d'islamologie, enseigne aux universités d'Oxford et de Rotterdam. Attaché à l'université de Doshisha (Kyoto), il est également président du groupe de réflexion et d'action European Muslim Network à Bruxelles.

Wabi Sabi is the comfortable joy you felt as a child, happily singing off key, creatively coloring outside the lines, and mispronouncing words with gusto.

Local forestry officials, powerless to stop the elephant, call in one of India's last licensed elephant hunters and issue a warrant for the rogue's destruction. Reading about the ensuing hunt in a Delhi newspaper, journalist Tarquin Hall flies to Assam to investigate. To the Elephant Graveyard is the compelling account of the search for a killer elephant in the northeast corner of India, and a vivid portrait of the Khasi tribe, who live intimately with the elephants. Though it seems a world of peaceful coexistence between man and beast, Hall begins to see that the elephants are suffering, having lost their natural habitat to the destruction of the forests and modernization. Hungry, confused, and with little forest left to hide in, herds of elephants are slowly adapting to domestication, but many are resolute and furious.

"Tasha Tudor, Richard Brown",The Private World of Tasha Tudor,,English,,"Tasha Tudor has written and illustrated more than seventy-five beloved children's books since her first, Pumpkin Moonshine, in 1938. Now seventy-seven years old, she lives on a farm in southern Vermont, where she has recreated an early Victorian world. To capture this intimate portrait of Tasha Tudor, photographer Richard Brown followed her throughout a year on her farm. By interweaving Tudor's own words and more than 100 color photographs, Brown has evoked the essence of Tudor's uniquely appealing personality and way of life. The inspiration for Tudor's art is evident in her delightful surroundings. Foremost is the magnificent garden she designed and rightfully calls ""Paradise on earth."" A lively menagerie is always underfoot, indoors and out, including her trademark corgies, the Nubian goats she milks twice a day, the one-eyed cat Minou, the chickens, fantail doves, and the cockatiels, canaries, exotic finches, and parrots that inhabit a virtual village of antique cages. We watch Tudor at work in a corner of her winter kitchen, her ""chipmunk's nest,"" on the delicate watercolors and drawings that illustrate the books and calendars that have charmed three generations. Examples of her work are scattered throughout the book, including many drawings from her sketchbook and vignettes never previously published. Her enchanting three-story dollhouse is featured in detail as are her handmade dolls and marionettes as well as the candlelit tree that is the centerpiece of Tasha Tudor's old-fashioned New England Christmas. Born in 1914 into Boston society (she sat on Oliver Wendell Holmes's knee as a child; Mark Twain and Albert Einstein were also her parents' friends), Tudor felt from an early age that she had lived before, in the 1830s. She says, ""Everything comes so easily to me from that period, of that time: threading a loom, growing flax, spinning, milking a cow."" Dressed in antique clothing, spinning and weaving her own linen, cooking on a woodstove with nineteenth-century utensils, Tudor inhabits a world that in all these evocative photographs speaks to all who long for a simpler existence in harmony with the seasonal rhythms of nature.",,,,October 28th 1992,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Gardening', 'Art', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Childrens', 'Photography', 'American']",,9780316112925,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441176711l/189428._SX318_.jpg,4.42,[],88.0,1.0,,189428.The_Private_World_of_Tasha_Tudor,,,,,98.0,736.0,144,,Little Brown and Company,"['420', '220', '84', '9', '3']",,,[],,

Tatiana de Rosnay (Goodreads Author),A Secret Kept,,English,,"This stunning novel from Tatiana de Rosnay, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestseller Sarah's Key, plumbs the depths of complex family relationships and the power of a past secret to change everything in the present. It all began with a simple seaside vacation, a brother and sister recapturing their childhood. Antoine Rey thought he had the perfect surprise for his sister Mélanie's birthday: a weekend by the sea at Noirmoutier Island, where the pair spent many happy childhood summers playing on the beach. It had been too long, Antoine thought, since they'd returned to the island - over thirty years, since their mother died and the family holidays ceased. But the island's haunting beauty triggers more than happy memories; it reminds Mélanie of something unexpected and deeply disturbing about their last island summer. When, on the drive home to Paris, she finally summons the courage to reveal what she knows to Antoine, her emotions overcome her and she loses control of the car. Recovering from the accident in a nearby hospital, Mélanie tries to recall what caused her to crash. Antoine encounters an unexpected ally: sexy, streetwise Angèle, a mortician who will teach him new meanings for the words life, love and death. Suddenly, however, the past comes swinging back at both siblings, burdened with a dark truth about their mother, Clarisse. Trapped in the wake of a shocking family secret shrouded by taboo, Antoine must confront his past and also his troubled relationships with his own children. How well does he really know his mother, his children, even himself? Suddenly fragile on all fronts as a son, a husband, a brother and a father, Antoine Rey will learn the truth about his family and himself the hard way. By turns thrilling, seductive and destructive, with a lingering effect that is bittersweet and redeeming, A Secret Kept is the story of a modern family, the invisible ties that hold it together, and the impact it has throughout life.",,,04/02/09,September 14th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'France', 'Mystery', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Family']",,9780312593315,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442696422l/7963208._SY475_.jpg,3.35,[],99.0,1.0,,7963208-a-secret-kept,,,,,83.0,25067.0,303,,St. Martin's Press,"['3139', '7706', '9845', '3467', '910']",,,[],,

"Taya Kyle, Jim DeFelice (Goodreads Author)","American Wife: Love, War, Faith, and Renewal",,English,,"The widow of American Sniper Chris Kyle shares their private story: an unforgettable testament to the power of love and faith in the face of war and unimaginable loss—and a moving tribute to a man whose true heroism ran even deeper than the legend.In early 2013, Taya Kyle and her husband, Chris, were the happiest they ever had been. Their decade-long marriage had survived years of war that took Chris, a U.S. Navy SEAL, away from Taya and their two children for agonizingly long stretches while he put his life on the line in many major battles of the Iraq War. After struggling to readjust to life out of the military, Chris had found new purpose in redirecting his lifelong dedication to service toward supporting veterans and their families. Their love had deepened, and their family was whole, finally.Then, the unthinkable. On February 2, 2013, Chris and his friend Chad Littlefield were killed while attempting to help a troubled vet. The life Chris and Taya fought so hard to build was shattered. In an instant, Taya became a single parent of two. A widow. A young woman facing the rest of her life without the man she loved.Chris and Taya's remarkable story has captivated millions through Clint Eastwood's blockbuster Academy Award-winning film American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper as Chris and Sienna Miller as Taya, and because of Chris's bestselling memoir, in which Taya contributed passages that formed the book's emotional core. Now, with trusted collaborator Jim DeFelice, Taya writes in never-before-told detail about the hours, days, and months after Chris's shocking death when grief threatened to overwhelm her.And yet throughout, friendship, family, and a deepening faith were lifelines that sustained her and the kids when the sorrow became too much. Two years after her husband's tragic death, Taya has found renewed meaning and connection to Chris by advancing their shared mission of ""serving those who serve others,"" particularly military and first-responder families. She and the children are now embracing a new future, one that honors the past but also looks forward with hope, gratitude, and joy.American Wife is one of the most remarkable memoirs of the year—a universal chronicle of love and heartbreak, service and sacrifice, faith and purpose that will inspire every reader.",,,05/01/15,May 4th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'True Story', 'Christian']",,9780062398086,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423605837l/23462662.jpg,4.26,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Memoir & Autobiography (2015)'],89.0,1.0,,23462662-american-wife,,,,,96.0,4127.0,329,,William Morrow,"['2071', '1287', '592', '125', '52']",,,[],,

Taylor Caldwell,Captains and the Kings,,English,,"This is a great surging novel about the amassing of a colossal fortune, the political power that comes with it, and the operation of a curse laid on an Irish-American dynasty and the ruthless driving man who founded it.Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh was thirteen years old when he first saw America through a dirty porthole on the steerage deck of The Irish Queen. It was the early 1850's and he was a penniless immigrant, an orphan cast on a hostile shore to make a home for himself and his younger brother and infant sister. Some seventy years later, from his deathbed, Joseph Armagh last glimpsed his adopted land from the gleaming windows of a palatial estate. A multi-millionaire, one of the most powerful and feared men, Joseph Armagh had indeed found a home. CAPTAINS AND KINGS is the story of the price that was paid for it in the consuming, single-minded determination of a man clawing his way to the top; in the bitter-sweet bliss of the love of a beautiful woman; in the almost too-late enjoyment of extraordinary children; and in the curse which used the hand of fate to strike in the very face of success itself.Once again, Taylor Caldwell has looked into America's roistering past as a setting for a drama of the consequences of savage ambition - and its meaning then and now.",,,10/28/72,April 1989,"['Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh', 'Harry Zieff', 'Bernadette Hennessey Armagh', 'Elizabeth Healey Hennessey', 'Charles Desmond', 'Rory Armagh', 'Mary Armag', 'Marjorie Chisholm', 'Ed Healey', 'Sean Armagh', 'Courtney Wickersham', 'Tom Hennessey', 'Katherine Hennessey', 'Kevin Armagh', 'Honora Houlihan', 'Miss Emmy', 'Claudia', 'Martinique']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Historical Romance', 'Drama', 'American', 'Literature']",,9780449205624,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586112484l/369110._SY475_.jpg,4.13,[],416.0,5.0,,369110.Captains_and_the_Kings,,,,,96.0,18050.0,816,,Fawcett Crest,"['7707', '6029', '3511', '616', '187']",,,[],,

Ted Bernal Guevara (Goodreads Author),Lips of a Mastodon,,English,,"(BACK COVER)Why does Ted Bernal Guevara keep putting out these James Dean conceptual novels? In plain truth, Guevara says, “He’s like a kid (James Dean) I went to class with, rode the bus with and slid down an awesome snow-packed hill with.” And after high school, he goes on to Hollywood fame and immortality while Guevara from his modest bookish world is left to wonder about the iconic image, giving it a stark, poignant voice sixty years later. Guevara grew up in Marion, Indiana, where the actor was born. In 1954, Dean met perhaps the one real romance of his brief life. Italian actress Pier Angeli was barely 22 when her movie The Silver Chalice coincided with Dean’s East of Eden at Warner Brothers. She’d sneak over to watch him perform, and he would do the same. When they finally interact, Pier’s mother disapproves of Dean’s behavior, attire and not being Catholic.Some say it was all for the limelight and publicity. Guevara’s gripping and frank story vies otherwise, excavating the actor’s true passion for the lovely but quaint Ms. Angeli.Guevara is also the author of True Feel, A Circle with Two Corners, and Days of Slint, the first James Dean conceptual novel.",,First,,September 30th 2015,[],Paperback,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Psychological Thriller', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adventure']",,9781512216318,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438191401l/26004546.jpg,3.9,[],2798.0,28.0,,26004546-lips-of-a-mastodon,,,,,85.0,482.0,226,,Rumble Lit Press,"['179', '184', '48', '34', '37']",,,[],,

  , 
Inc. reports on the astounding economic and political ramifications of an aging world. The world’s population is rapidly aging—by the year 2030, one billion people will be sixty-five or older. As the ratio of the old to the young grows ever larger, global aging has gone critical: For the first time in history, the number of people over age fifty will be greater than those under age seventeen. Few of us under­stand the resulting massive effects on economies, jobs, and families. Everyone is touched by this issue—parents and children, rich and poor, retirees and workers—and now veteran jour­nalist Ted C. Fishman masterfully and movingly explains how our world is being altered in ways no one ever expected. What happens when too few young people must support older people? How do shrinking families cope with aging loved ones? What happens when countries need millions of young workers but lack them? How do compa­nies compete for young workers? Why, exactly, do they shed old workers? How are entire industries being both created and destroyed by demographic change? How do communities and countries remake themselves for ever-growing populations of older citizens? Who will suffer? Who will benefit? With vivid and witty reporting from American cities and around the world, and through compelling interviews with families, employers, workers, economists, gerontologists, government officials, health-care professionals, corporate executives, and small business owners, Fishman reveals the astonishing and interconnected effects of global aging, and why nations, cultures, and crucial human relationships are changing in this timely, brilliant, and important read.",,,,October 19th 2010,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Science', 'Medical', 'Politics', 'Audiobook', 'Society', 'Social Science', 'Sociology']",,9781439191132,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344664130l/9562093.jpg,3.48,[],90.0,1.0,,9562093-shock-of-gray,,,,,84.0,193.0,416,,Scribner,"['32', '67', '63', '23', '8']",,,[],,

What if we discovered that the fundamentals of mathematics were arbitrary and inconsistent? What if there were a science of naming things that calls life into being from inanimate matter? What if exposure to an alien language forever changed our perception of time?

Ted Conover,The Routes of Man: How Roads Are Changing the World and the Way We Live Today,,English,,"From the Pulitzer Prize finalist and National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author of Newjack,"" "" an absorbing book about roads and their power to change the world. Roads bind our world--metaphorically and literally--transforming landscapes and the lives of the people who inhabit them. Roads have unparalleled power to impact communities, unite worlds and sunder them, and reveal the hopes and fears of those who travel them. With his marvelous eye for detail and his contagious enthusiasm, Ted Conover explores six of these key byways worldwide. In Peru, he traces the journey of a load of rare mahogany over the Andes to its origin, an untracked part of the Amazon basin soon to be traversed by a new east-west route across South America. In East Africa, he visits truckers whose travels have been linked to the worldwide spread of AIDS. In the West Bank, he monitors highway checkpoints with Israeli soldiers and then passes through them with Palestinians, witnessing the injustices and danger borne by both sides. He shuffles down a frozen riverbed with teenagers escaping their Himalayan valley to see how a new road will affect the now-isolated Indian region of Ladakh. From the passenger seat of a new Hyundai piling up the miles, he describes the exuberant upsurge in car culture as highways proliferate across China. And from inside an ambulance, he offers an apocalyptic but precise vision of Lagos, Nigeria, where congestion and chaos on freeways signal the rise of the global megacity. A spirited, urgent book that reveals the costs and benefits of being connected--how, from ancient Rome to the present, roads have played a crucial role in human life, advancing civilization even as they set it back.",,,11/06/10,February 9th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'History', 'Transport', 'Sociology', 'Geography', 'Adventure', 'Urban Planning', 'Science', 'Road Trip']",,9781400042449,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320439672l/6681558.jpg,3.78,[],85.0,1.0,,6681558-the-routes-of-man,,,,,92.0,590.0,352,,Alfred A.

Ted Dekker (Goodreads Author),The Slumber of Christianity: Awakening a Passion for Heaven on Earth,,English,,"As believers, our walk with God is motivated by ""hope""-not the bland, vague notion most people have, but the expectation of an exotic, pleasurable inheritance that guides us and fires our passion...or, at least, should.Ted Dekker has written an expose on the death of pleasure within the Church. Because many of us have set aside hope and the inspired imagination that drives it, Dekker says we have been lulled into a slumber of boredom, even despondency. Our faith wanes, the joy at having been liberated fades, and we feel powerless. ""The Slumber of Christianity"" explores what robs us of happiness and how we can rediscover it and live lives that rekindle hope. The pursuit of pleasure is a gift to all humans-a function of the Creator himself, who is bent upon our happiness.It's time for Christians to reclaim our inheritance of pleasure. ""The Slumber of Christianity"" will inflame hearts toward full-fledged, mind-expanding encounters with hope, through the imagination.

But that yes means looking at ourselves and the world differently, which leads to a new way of being. The Forgotten Way Meditations is a journey of re-discovering the radical love, peace, and identity found in Yeshua so you can see and be differently.  Forgotten, because Yeshua's simple path of awakening to love, peace and power in this life is rarely remembered (or understood) by millions of Christians weighed down with life's cares and concerns. Way because it is a pathway we walk, not a checklist of rules to follow.  Read The Forgotten Way as a book, or take the journey through 21 short daily meditations and you will never see yourself in the same way. Come all who are weary and find rest. Enter the Way of Yeshua so easily forgotten. Take the journey from hate to love; from fear to faith. The journey from insecurity to complete rest. Here you will find peace in the storms; you will walk on the troubled seas of your life. Love, joy and peace will flow from you as living waters.

  This story is for everyone--but not everyone is for this story. 
It is a dangerous tale of times past. A love story full of deep seduction. A story of terrible longing and bold sacrifice. Then as now, evil begins its courtship cloaked in light. And the heart embraces what it should flee. Forgetting it once had a truer lover. With a kiss, evil will ravage body, soul, and mind. Yet there remains hope, because the heart knows no bounds. Love will prove greater than lust. Sacrifice will overcome seduction. And blood will flow. Because the battle for the heart is always violently opposed.

Ted Gioia,The History of Jazz,,English,,"Jazz is the most colorful and varied art form in the world and it was born in one of the most colorful and varied cities, New Orleans. From the seed first planted by slave dances held in Congo Square and nurtured by early ensembles led by Buddy Belden and Joe ""King"" Oliver, jazz began its long winding odyssey across America and around the world, giving flower to a thousand different forms--swing, bebop, cool jazz, jazz-rock fusion--and a thousand great musicians. Now, in The History of Jazz, Ted Gioia tells the story of this music as it has never been told before, in a book that brilliantly portrays the legendary jazz players, the breakthrough styles, and the world in which it evolved. Here are the giants of jazz and the great moments of jazz history--Jelly Roll Morton (""the world's greatest hot tune writer""), Louis Armstrong (whose O-keh recordings of the mid-1920s still stand as the most significant body of work that jazz has produced), Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, cool jazz greats such as Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, and Lester Young, Charlie Parker's surgical precision of attack, Miles Davis's 1955 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, Ornette Coleman's experiments with atonality, Pat Metheny's visionary extension of jazz-rock fusion, the contemporary sounds of Wynton Marsalis, and the post-modernists of the Knitting Factory. Gioia provides the reader with lively portraits of these and many other great musicians, intertwined with vibrant commentary on the music they created. Gioia also evokes the many worlds of jazz, taking the reader to the swamp lands of the Mississippi Delta, the bawdy houses of New Orleans, the rent parties of Harlem, the speakeasies of Chicago during the Jazz Age, the after hours spots of corrupt Kansas city, the Cotton Club, the Savoy, and the other locales where the history of jazz was made. And as he traces the spread of this protean form, Gioia provides much insight into the social context in which the music was born. He shows for instance how the development of technology helped promote the growth of jazz--how ragtime blossomed hand-in-hand with the spread of parlor and player pianos, and how jazz rode the growing popularity of the record industry in the 1920s. We also discover how bebop grew out of the racial unrest of the 1940s and '50s, when black players, no longer content with being ""entertainers,"" wanted to be recognized as practitioners of a serious musical form. Jazz is a chameleon art, delighting us with the ease and rapidity with which it changes colors. Now, in Ted Gioia's The History of Jazz, we have at last a book that captures all these colors on one glorious palate. Knowledgeable, vibrant, and comprehensive, it is among the small group of books that can truly be called classics of jazz literature.",,,November 1st 1997,May 6th 1998,[],Paperback,"['Music', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Jazz', 'Art', 'Cultural', 'Reference', 'Criticism', 'American History', 'The United States Of America']",,9780195126532,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348549243l/177539.jpg,4.06,[],7.0,1.0,,177539.The_History_of_Jazz,,,,,93.0,3770.0,471,,Oxford University Press,"['1511', '1347', '634', '169', '109']",,,[],,
Ted Gup,A Secret Gift: How One Man's Kindness & a Trove of Letters Revealed the Hidden History of the Great Depression,,English,,"An inspiring account of America at its worst-and Americans at their best-woven from the stories of Depression-era families who were helped by gifts from the author's generous and secretive grandfather.   Shortly before Christmas 1933 in Depression-scarred Canton, Ohio, a small newspaper ad offered $10, no strings attached, to 75 families in distress. Interested readers were asked to submit letters describing their hardships to a benefactor calling himself Mr. B. Virdot. The author's grandfather Sam Stone was inspired to place this ad and assist his fellow Cantonians as they prepared for the cruelest Christmas most of them would ever witness.  Moved by the tales of suffering and expressions of hope contained in the letters, which he discovered in a suitcase 75 years later, Ted Gup initially set out to unveil the lives behind them, searching for records and relatives all over the country who could help him flesh out the family sagas hinted at in those letters. From these sources, Gup has re-created the impact that Mr B. Virdot's gift had on each family. Many people yearned for bread, coal, or other necessities, but many others received money from B. Virdot for more fanciful items-a toy horse, say, or a set of encyclopedias. As Gup's investigations revealed, all these things had the power to turn people's lives around- even to save them.  But as he uncovered the suffering and triumphs of dozens of strangers, Gup also learned that Sam Stone was far more complex than the lovable- retiree persona he'd always shown his grandson. Gup unearths deeply buried details about Sam's life-from his impoverished, abusive upbringing to felonious efforts to hide his immigrant origins from U.S. officials-that help explain why he felt such a strong affinity to strangers in need. Drawing on his unique find and his award-winning reportorial gifts, Ted Gup solves a singular family mystery even while he pulls away the veil of eight decades that separate us from the hardships that united America during the Depression. In A Secret Gift, he weaves these revelations seamlessly into a tapestry of Depression-era America, which will fascinate and inspire in equal measure.Watch a Video",,,10/30/10,October 28th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Christmas', 'Book Club', 'Adult']",,9781594202704,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442594502l/8860297._SY475_.jpg,3.58,['Ohioana Book Award for Nonfiction (2011)'],177.0,2.0,,8860297-a-secret-gift,,,,,88.0,2509.0,384,,Penguin Press,"['471', '872', '861', '254', '51']",,,[],,

Some are love letters, others haunted recollections and ruminations. In them, Hughes recalls his and Plath's time together, drawing on the powerful imagery of his work--animal, vegetable, mythological--as well as on Plath's famous verse.Countless books have discussed the subject of this intense relationship from a necessary distance, but this volume--at last--offers us Hughes's own account.

Like all women of her rank, she was expected to marry a prosperous Muslim from a respectable family, bear him many children and lead a sheltered life of leisure. Her marriage to Mustafa Khar, one of Pakistan's most eminent political figures, soon turned into a nightmare. Violently possessive and pathologically jealous, Mustafa Khar succeeded in cutting her off from the outside world. For fourteen years, Tehmina suffered alone, in silence. When she decided to rebel, the price she paid was extremely high: as a Muslim woman seeking a divorce, she signed away all financial support, lost the custody of her four children, and found herself alienated from her friends and disowned by her parents. When this book was first published it shook Pakistani society to its foundations. Here at last was someone who had succeded in reconciling her faith in Islam with her ardent belief in women's rights.

Tennessee Williams,Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,,English,,"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof first heated up Broadway in 1955 with its gothic American story of brothers vying for their dying father’s inheritance amid a whirlwind of sexuality, untethered in the person of Maggie the Cat. The play also daringly showcased the burden of sexuality repressed in the agony of her husband, Brick Pollitt. In spite of the public controversy Cat stirred up, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award for that year. Williams, as he so often did with his plays, rewrote Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for many years—the present version was originally produced at the American Shakespeare Festival in 1974 with all the changes that made Williams finally declare the text to be definitive, and was most recently produced on Broadway in the 2003–2004 season.

The story famously recounts how the faded and promiscuous Blanche DuBois is pushed over the edge by her sexy and brutal brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski.

"Tennessee Williams, Robert Bray (Introduction)",The Glass Menagerie,,English,,"No play in the modern theatre has so captured the imagination and heart of the American public as Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie. As Williams's first popular success, it launched the brilliant, if somewhat controversial, career, of our pre-eminent lyric playwright. Since its premiere in Chicago in 1944, with the legendary Laurette Taylor in the role of Amanda, Menagaerie has been the bravura piece for great actresses from Jessica Tandy to Joanne Woodward, and is studied and performed in classrooms and theatres around the world. The Glass Menagerie (in the reading text the author preferred) is now available only in its New Directions Paperbook edition.

This trial, stemming from an incident which in itself seemed relatively unimportant, soon developed into a spectacular and significant struggle on the outcome of which certain fundamental principles of democracy were at issue. A pleasant young English boy, on seemingly conclusive evidence, was discharged from an English government school. The boy's father, believing implicitly in the youth's denial of guilt, starts to investigate the procedure by which the lad was allegedly deprived of his rights as an individual. The father puts the case into the hands of an eminent lawyer who considers the issues involved just as important as does the plaintiff. During the years that the legal fight continues, the entire country is aroused over the principles involved, and the boy's family become impoverished and suffer acutely from a sort of social ostracism to which they all fall victims. The father's stand, in particular, assumes an almost fanatical character. At the end, however - because of his ultimate belief in justice and democratic ideals - his stand is triumphantly justified.",,,11/06/46,February 18th 1991,"['Ronnie Winslow', 'Arthur Winslow', 'Catherine (Kate) Winslow', 'Sir Robert Morton']",Paperback,"['Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Literature', 'School', 'Read For School', 'British Literature']",,9780582060197,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356444852l/3297694.jpg,3.76,"['Ellen Terry Award for the best play of (1946)', ""New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Foreign Play (1948)""]",93.0,1.0,,3297694-the-winslow-boy,,,,,91.0,521.0,184,,Longman,"['129', '204', '140', '30', '18']",,,[],,

"Teresa Rodriguez, Diana Montané, Lisa Pulitzer",The Daughters of Juárez: A True Story of Serial Murder South of the Border,,English,,"Despite the fact that Juarez is a Mexican border city just across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas, most Americans are unaware that for more than twelve years this city has been the center of an epidemic of horrific crimes against women and girls, consisting of kidnappings, rape, mutilation, and murder, with most of the victims conforming to a specific profile: young, slender, and poor, fueling the premise that the murders are not random. Indeed, there has been much speculation that the killer or killers are American citizens. While some leading members of the American media have reported on the situation, prompting the U.S. government to send in top criminal profilers from the FBI, little real information about this international atrocity has emerged. According to Amnesty International, as of 2006 more than 400 bodies have been recovered, with hundreds still missing.As for who is behind the murders themselves, the answer remains unknown, although many have argued that the killings have become a sort of blood sport, due to the lawlessness of the city itself. Among the theories being considered are illegal trafficking in human organs, ritualistic satanic sacrifices, copycat killers, and a conspiracy between members of the powerful Juarez drug cartel and some corrupt Mexican officials who have turned a blind eye to the felonies, all the while lining their pockets with money drenched in blood.Despite numerous arrests over the last ten years, the murders continue to occur, with the killers growing bolder, dumping bodies in the city itself rather than on the outskirts of town, as was initially the case, indicating a possible growing and most alarming alliance of silence and cover-up by Mexican politicians.""The Daughters of Juarez"" promises to be the first eye-opening, authoritative nonfiction work of its kind to examine the brutal killings and draw attention to these atrocities on the border. The end result will shock readers and become required reading on the subject for years to come.",,,,March 27th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'History', 'Mystery', 'Social Issues', 'Latin American', 'Gender', 'Politics', 'Death']",,9780743292030,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388471983l/181430.jpg,3.8,[],65.0,1.0,,181430.The_Daughters_of_Ju_rez,,,,,92.0,996.0,316,,Atria Books,"['267', '356', '290', '70', '13']",,,"['Juarez (Mexico)', 'Mexico']",,

Teresa of Ávila,The Way of Perfection,,English,,"Of all of Teresa of Avila's works, The Way of Perfection is the most easily understood. Written at the height of the controversy surrounding the reforms Teresa instituted in the Carmelite order, it instructed the nuns in the practice of prayer. Teresa discusses the three essentials of a prayer-filled life -- fraternal love, detachment from material things, and true humility. Her counsels on these are the fruit of her practical experience. The book develops these ideas and takes up directly the matters of prayer and contemplation. Teresa gives various maxims for the practice of prayer and concludes the book with her masterful and impassioned version of the Lord's Prayer. ""How is it that Thou canst give us so much with Thy first word?"" she says of the ""Our"" at the beginning of that prayer.

Teri Maxwell,Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit,,English,,"A desire of a homeschooling mother's heart is to have a meek and quiet spirit instead of discouragement, fear, and anger. She can cope with the myriad of daily difficulties and decisions that a homeschooling lifestyle brings with it, as long as she is having the right responses to them. Let her be fearful, worried, anxious, frustrated, irritated, or angry and a mom soon realizes she is undermining all she wants to accomplish by homeschooling. Because Teri Maxwell, a mother of eight, has walked the homeschooling path since 1985, she knows first-hand the struggle for a meek and quiet spirit. The memories from her early homeschooling years of often being worried and angry rather than having a meek and quiet spirit are not what she would like them to be.Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit includes Teri sharing the work the Lord has done in her heart through homeschooling. Other homeschooling moms will be encouraged that He can do the same for them. Teri also desires that homeschooling mothers could learn from the lessons the Lord has taught her so that they would begin to have a meek and quiet spirit long before she did.Will the reader's journey toward a meek and quiet spirit be completed upon finding the perfect spelling curriculum or deciding which chores a child should be doing? Or does the answer lie on a different path? In these pages, Teri offers practical insights into gaining a meek and quiet spirit, along with chapter-by-chapter projects, that any mom can apply to her individual circumstances. She transparently shares the struggles God has brought her through and what He has shown her during these many homeschooling years.Throughout Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit, the heart issues that will gently lead you to a meek and quiet spirit are discovered.

He is very much interested in what it means to be an artist and a black man. In his first collection, Muscular Music, he took the reader through a living library of cultural icons, from Shaft and Fat Albert to John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His second collection, Hip Logic, continued these explorations of popular culture, fatherhood, cultural heritage, and loss. Wind in a Box, Hayes’s resonant new collection, continues his interest in how traditions (of poetry and culture alike) can be simultaneously upended and embraced. The struggle for freedom (the wind) within containment (the box) is the unifying motif as Hayes explores how identity is shaped by race, heritage, and spirituality.

But, while there has long been help to save humans, there wasn't anyone who focused on helping the animals. This is why EARS—Emergency Animal Rescue Service—came into being. Inside are the real-life stories of EARS volunteers, and how their efforts have saved countless animals from certain death. You will read about the touching reunions of pet owners with the cherished pets they feared were dead. You will appreciate the wonderful service that EARS and its thousands of volunteers provide to all of us with their rescue efforts. Most of all these stories will make you laugh, cry, and marvel at the deep connection humans and animals share.These and other stories are sure to inspire and thrill as well as make you appreciate the wonderful bond that exists between animals and the special people who care enough to save them.",,,,September 28th 2000,[],Hardcover,"['Animals', 'Nonfiction']",,9780761517061,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1183985316l/1474141.jpg,4.26,[],36.0,1.0,,1474141.Emergency_Animal_Rescue_Stories,,,,,93.0,61.0,384,,Prima Lifestyles,"['32', '19', '6', '2', '2']",,,[],,

Terri Giuliano Long,In Leah's Wake,,English,,"A Story of Love, Loss, Connection, and GraceAt the heart of the seemingly perfect Tyler family stands sixteen-year-old Leah. Her proud parents are happily married, successful professionals. Her adoring younger sister is wise and responsible beyond her years. And Leah herself is a talented athlete with a bright collegiate future. But living out her father’s lost dreams, and living up to her sister’s worshipful expectations, is no easy task for a teenager. And when temptation enters her life in the form of drugs, desire, and a dangerously exciting boy, Leah’s world turns on a dime from idyllic to chaotic to nearly tragic.As Leah’s conflicted emotions take their toll on those she loves—turning them against each other and pushing them to destructive extremes—In Leah’s Wake powerfully explores one of fiction’s most enduring themes: the struggle of teenagers coming of age, and coming to terms with the overwhelming feelings that rule them and the demanding world that challenges them. Terri Giuliano Long’s skillfully styled and insightfully informed debut novel captures the intensely personal tragedies, victories, and revelations each new generation faces during those tumultuous transitional years.Recipient of multiple awards and honors, In Leah’s Wake is a compelling and satisfying reading experience with important truths to share—by a new author with the voice of a natural storyteller and an unfailingly keen understanding of the human condition…at every age.Nominated Global eBook Award (New Edition, 2012)Book Bundlz 2011 Book PickBook Bundlz Book Club 2011 Favorites - First Place",,,,October 1st 2010,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Drama', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Womens Fiction', 'Adult', 'Mystery']",,9781456310547,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1307033996l/9791117.jpg,3.22,"['IndieReader Discovery Award (IRDA) for Literary Fiction (Tie) (2012)', 'Global Ebook Awards Nominee (2012)']",92.0,1.0,,9791117-in-leah-s-wake,,,,,76.0,2840.0,368,,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,"['358', '750', '1055', '505', '172']",,,[],,
Terri Irwin,Steve & Me,,English,,"When Terri Raines was twenty-seven years old, she took a vacation that changed her life. Leaving behind her wildlife rescue work in Oregon, Terri traveled to Australia, and there, at a small wildlife park, she met and fell in love with a tall, blond force of nature named Steve Irwin. They were married in less than a year, and Terri eagerly joined in Steve's conservation work. The footage filmed on their crocodile-trapping honeymoon became the first episode of T""he Crocodile Hunter, "" and together, Steve and Terri began to change the world. In ""Steve & Me, "" Terri recounts the unforgettable adventures they shared -- wrangling venomous snakes, saving deadly crocodiles from poachers, swimming among humpback whales. A uniquely gifted naturalist, Steve was first and foremost a wildlife warrior dedicated to rescuing endangered animals -- especially his beloved crocs -- and educating everyone he could reach about the importance of conservation. In the hit TV shows that continue to be broadcast worldwide, Steve's enthusiasm lives on, bringing little-known and often-feared species to light as he reveals and revels in the wonders of our planet.With grace, wit, and candor, Terri Irwin portrays her husband as he really was -- a devoted family man, a fervently dedicated environmentalist, a modest bloke who spoke to millions on behalf of those who could not speak for themselves. ""Steve & Me"" is a nonstop adventure, a real-life love story, and a fitting tribute to a man adored by all those whose lives he touched, written by the woman who knew and loved him best of all.",,,,October 30th 2007,"['Terri', 'Bindi', 'Robert Irwin', 'Steve Irwin', 'Terri Irwin']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Animals', 'Autobiography', 'Australia', 'Biography Memoir', 'Romance', 'Nature', 'Adventure']",,9781416953883,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424469895l/486550.jpg,4.33,[],58.0,1.0,,486550.Steve_Me,,,,,97.0,2807.0,273,,Simon Spotlight Entertainment,"['1447', '917', '372', '53', '18']",,,['Australia'],,
Terri Jentz,Strange Piece of Paradise,,English,,"In the summer of 1977, Terri Jentz and her Yale roommate took a cross-country bike trip. As they lay sleeping in the central Oregon desert, a man in a pickup truck deliberately ran over their tent and proceeded to attack them with an axe. The horrific crime was reported in newspapers across the country, but no one was ever arrested. Fifteen years later, Jentz returns to the small town where she was nearly murdered and makes an extraordinary discovery: the violence of that night is as present for the community as it is for her. Shockingly, many say they know who did it, and he is living freely in their midst.Powerful, eloquent, and paced like the most riveting of thrillers, Strange Piece of Paradise is a startling profile of a psychopath, a sweeping reflection on violence and the myth of American individualism, and a moving record of Jentz's brave inner journey from violence to hope.",,,05/02/06,March 20th 2007,[],Paperback,"['True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Crime', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Womens', 'Autobiography']",,9780312426699,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316728426l/141596.jpg,3.73,"['Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (2007)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2006)']",72.0,1.0,,141596.Strange_Piece_of_Paradise,,,,,88.0,1753.0,729,,St. Martins Press-3PL,"['466', '610', '467', '165', '45']",,,[],,

Terry Breverton,The Pirate Dictionary,,,History,"We hear the terms steer clear of, hit the deck, don't rock the boat, and to harbor a grudge and give little thought to their origin. Left together on ships for months, and often for years, pirate crews developed expressions that made their way into common usage. Terms for things related to life at sea became idioms used by land lubbers, a term derived from the holes in the platforms surrounding the mast that allowed sailors to avoid climbing the rigging around the platforms. A lubber was someone who was very clumsy, so a land lubber is someone who knows nothing about sailing and rigging.Centuries ago, men wore wigs of length denoting their wealth and importance. Soon, many naval captains, including Sir Henry Morgan and Captain Chaloner Ogle, who killed Black Bart Roberts, began to adopt the style. A law was passed in England declaring that only nobility, judges, and bishops could wear full-length wigs and so was born the term bigwig .Reading through these words and phrases is an abbreviated trip through history, with lists of major naval mutinies, a summary of the slave trade, and even jokes. This dictionary is written to be entertaining as well as informative, to give a flavor of the interesting times from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries when pirates controlled many sealanes. It also contains a treasure trove of factual information about life aboard the ship, important pirate haunts, and technical terms.",,,,2004.0,,,,1589802438,9781589802438,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c5CongEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.69,,,,,,,,,,,,189.0,,,,50.0,,,,

Terry Brooks (Goodreads Author),Indomitable,,English,,"Also available in Legends IIBONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Measure of the Magic.The time of the Shannara follows in the wake of an apocalypse that has destroyed the old world and very nearly annihilated its people as well. A thousand years of savagery and barbarism have concluded at the start the series with the emergence of a new civilization in which magic has replaced science as the dominant source of power. A Druid Council comprised of the most talented of the new races–Men, Dwarves, Trolls, Gnomes, and Elves, names taken from the old legends–has begun the arduous task of rebuilding the world and putting an end to the racial warfare that has consumed the survivors of the so-called Great Wars since their conclusion.But the wars continue, albeit in a different form. Magic, like science, is often mercurial, can be used for good or evil, and can have a positive or negative effect on those who come in contact with it. In The Sword of Shannara, a Druid subverted by his craving for magic’ s power manipulated Trolls and Gnomes in his effort to gain mastery over the other races. He failed because of Shea Ohmsford, the last of an Elven family with the Shannara surname. Shea, with the help of his brother and a small band of companions, was able to wield the fabled Sword of Shannara to destroy the Dark Lord. Subsequently, in the Elfstones of the Shannara, his grandson Wil was faced with another sort of challenge, one that required the use of a magic contained in a set of Elfstones.

Terry Brooks (Goodreads Author),Armageddon's Children,,English,,"Terry Brooks is one of a handful of writers whose work defines modern fantasy fiction. His twenty-three international bestsellers have ranged from the beloved Shannara series to stories that tread a much darker path. Armageddon’s Children is a new creation–the perfect opportunity for readers unfamiliar with Brooks’s previous work to experience an author at the height of his considerable storytelling powers. It is a gripping chronicle of a once-familiar world now spun shockingly out of control, in which an extraordinary few struggle to salvage hope in the face of terrifying chaos. Logan Tom is doomed to remember the past and determined to rescue the future. Far behind him lies a boyhood cut violently short by his family’s slaughter, when the forces of madness and hate swept our world after decadent excesses led to civilization’s downfall. Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance to beat back the minions of evil that are systematically killing and enslaving the last remnants of humanity. Navigating the scarred and poisoned landscape that once was America and guided by a powerful talisman, Logan has sworn an oath to seek out a remarkable being born of magic, possessed of untold abilities, and destined to lead the final fight against darkness.Across the country, Angel Perez, herself a survivor of the malevolent, death-dealing forces combing the land, has also been chosen for an uncanny mission in the name of her ruined world’s salvation. From the devastated streets of Los Angeles, she will journey to find a place–and a people–shrouded in mystery, celebrated in legend, and vital to the cause of humankind . . . even as a relentless foe follows close behind, bent on her extermination. While in the nearly forsaken city of Seattle, a makeshift family of refugees has carved out a tenuous existence among the street gangs, mutants, and marauders fighting to stay alive against mounting odds–and something unspeakable that has come from the shadows in search of prey. In time, all their paths will cross. Their common purpose will draw them together. Their courage and convictions will be tested and their fates will be decided, as their singular crusade begins: to take back, or lose forever, the only world they have.In Armageddon’s Children, Brooks brings his gifts as a mythmaker to the timeless theme of the unending, essential conflict between darkness and light–and carries his unique imaginative vision to a stunning new level. Prepare for a breathtaking tour de force. To those who are new to Terry Brooks, welcome. And to those who have read him for many years: prepare for a dramatic surprise.From the Hardcover edition.",Genesis of Shannara #1,,,September 30th 2006,"['Hawk (Shannara)', 'Findo Gask', 'Logan Tom', 'Angel Perez']",Hardcover,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Apocalyptic']",,9780345484086,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388198012l/15549.jpg,4.11,[],221.0,3.0,,15549.Armageddon_s_Children,,,,,95.0,15340.0,371,,Ballantine Books,"['6000', '5797', '2839', '565', '139']",,,[],,
Terry Brooks (Goodreads Author),The Elves of Cintra,,English,,"With his groundbreaking New York Times bestseller The Sword of Shannara and its acclaimed sequels, Terry Brooks brought a new audience to epic fantasy. Then he gave the genre a darkly compelling contemporary twist in his trilogy of the Word and the Void. Last year, in Armageddon’s Children, Brooks undertook the stunning chronicle that united two unique worlds. Now that story of clashing forces of darkness and light, of Shannara’s beginnings and the human race’s possible end, marches forward into an unforgettable second volume full of mystery, magic, and momentous events.Across the ruined landscape that is America–hopelessly poisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon armies bent on exterminating all mortal life–two pilgrims have been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. Logan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a ragged band of street urchins and the being known as “the gypsy morph,” who is both mortal and magical, and destined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, Angel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her from the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret place untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blight–a place where the race of Elves has dwelled since before man existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the Word swarm the ravening forces of the Void. As the menacing thunder of war drums heralds the arrival of the demons and their brutal minions in Seattle, the young survivors who call themselves the Ghosts are forced to brave the dangerous world of gangs, mutants, and worse to escape the invasion. And Logan Tom must infiltrate a refugee compound to rescue Hawk, the leader of the street urchins, who has yet to learn the truth about who and what he is. Meanwhile, Angel Perez has joined an equally urgent mission: to find the Ellcrys, a fabled talisman crucial to protecting the Elven realm against an influx of unspeakable evil from the dread dimension known as the Forbidding. But Angel and her Elf allies must beware–for a demon spy, with a monstrous creature at its command, walks among them.As the legions of darkness draw the noose tighter, and the time of confrontation draws near, those chosen to defend the soul of the world must draw their battle lines and prepare to fight with, and for, their lives.

Terry Eagleton,After Theory,,,Literary Collections,"As heralded everywhere from NPR to the pages of the New York Times Magazine, a new era is underway in our colleges and universities: after a lengthy tenure, the dominance of postmodern theory has come to an end.

What's needed now, After Theory argues, is a return to the big questions and grand narratives. Today's global politics demand we pay attention to a range of topics that have gone ignored by the academy and public alike, from fundamentalism to objectivity, religion to ethics.

Eagleton provides a brilliant and challenging introduction to these concerns, as characterized in the work of Kant, Schiller, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Lukacs, Adorno, Habermas, and others.

Terry Eagleton,Why Marx Was Right,,English,,"In this combative, controversial book, Terry Eagleton takes issue with the prejudice that Marxism is dead and done with. Taking ten of the most common objections to Marxism—that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so on—he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid.

Terry Jones and Alan Ereira are your guides to this most misrepresented and misunderstood period, and they point you to things that will surprise and provoke. Did you know, for example, that medieval people didn't think the world was flat? That was a total fabrication by an American journalist in the 19th century. Did you know that they didn't burn witches in the Middle Ages? That was a refinement of the so-called Renaissance.

Terry McMillan (Goodreads Author),How Stella Got Her Groove Back,,English,,"How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life--and what she must risk to do it. Stella Payne is forty-two, divorced, a high-powered investment analyst, mother of eleven-year-old Quincy- and she does it all. In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love--and all of love's nasty fallout--anyway.But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core--not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean--and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.",,,10/30/96,January 6th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Romance', 'African American', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'African American Literature', 'American']",,9780451209146,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348976850l/122205.jpg,3.75,[],100.0,1.0,,122205.How_Stella_Got_Her_Groove_Back,,,,,90.0,8855.0,401,,Berkley Books,"['2416', '2902', '2664', '694', '179']",,,['Jamaica'],,

After a few days of this, it was amazing how glad people were to see the kid with his magical rat pipe. And they were amazing when the rats followed hint out of town. They'd have been really amazed if they'd ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere outside of town and solemnly counted out the money. The Amazing Maurice runs the perfect Pied Piper scam. This streetwise alley cat knows the value of cold, hard cash and can talk his way into and out of anything. But when Maurice and his cohorts decide to con the town of Bad Blinitz, it will take more than fast talking to survive the danger that awaits. For this is a town where food is scarce and rats are hated, where cellars are lined with deadly traps, and where a terrifying evil lurks beneath the hunger-stricken streets.... Set in Terry Pratchett's widely popular Discworld, this masterfully crafted, gripping read is both compelling and funny.

Terry Pratchett,The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewWith the debut of his first young-adult novel, science fiction writer Terry Pratchett invites readers ages 12 and up to visit Discworld -- an imaginary land well known to Pratchett's adult following. At the heart of this tale is a slightly twisted take on the old Pied Piper theme, a talking, thinking cat named Maurice, and a supporting cast of equally talented rats who bear such comical names as Big Savings, Nourishing, and Dangerous Beans. Maurice and the rats have teamed up with a young lad named Keith to implement a clever moneymaking scheme. Upon entering a town, the rats make a general nuisance of themselves -- stealing food and widdling on things -- until the townsfolk become desperate to get rid of them. Then Maurice and Keith appear on the scene and offer to save the day by ridding the town of its infestation for a small fee. It seems like a surefire plan until the group arrives in the town of Bad Blintz and gets hooked up with Malicia, a young girl with a vivid imagination and a knack for finding trouble. When it's discovered that Bad Blintz already has a rat problem -- one that a couple of shifty-eyed rat catchers claim to have under control -- things turn deadly. For lurking beneath the town's streets is an obstacle course of mangling rattraps and noxious poisons. And beyond that is a monster so powerful and ugly, even Malicia couldn't imagine it. As Maurice and the rats battle for their very survival, a number of provocative themes surface: life after death, good versus evil, and the sacrifice of the few for the many. But be forewarned -- those in search of lighter fare in these troubled times may not find what they are looking for in Pratchett's vision Despite plenty of razor-sharp wit and lighthearted moments, this tale has an underbelly as dark as the tunnels beneath Bad Blintz. Though The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents is deeply witty and engaging, some readers may find parts of the story -- descriptions of how some of the rats die and how others eat their dead -- rather intense.

A lesser woman might have succumbed to poverty, but she was determined to keep her family financially afloat and to teach her children that the life of the mind was important. In the early 1950s, Ryan started entering contests, composing her jingles, poems, and essays at the ironing board. She won household appliances, bikes, watches, clocks, and, occasionally, cash.

Terry Teachout,Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong,,English,,"Product Description Louis Armstrong was the greatest jazz musician of the twentieth century and a giant of modern American culture. He knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts, wrote the finest of all jazz autobiographies--without a collaborator--and created collages that have been compared to the art of Romare Bearden. The ranks of his admirers included Johnny Cash, Jackson Pollock and Orson Welles. Offstage he was witty, introspective and unexpectedly complex, a beloved colleague with an explosive temper whose larger-than-life personality was tougher and more sharp-edged than his worshipping fans ever knew. Wall Street Journal arts columnist Terry Teachout has drawn on a cache of important new sources unavailable to previous Armstrong biographers, including hundreds of private recordings of backstage and after-hours conversations that Armstrong made throughout the second half of his life, to craft a sweeping new narrative biography of this towering figure that shares full, accurate versions of such storied events as Armstrong's decision to break up his big band and his quarrel with President Eisenhower for the first time. Certain to be the definitive word on Armstrong for our generation, Pops paints a gripping portrait of the man, his world and his music that will stand alongside Gary Giddins' Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams and Peter Guralnick's Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley as a classic biography of a major American musician.      Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Terry Teachout, Author of Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong[image]  Dear Amazon Readers: Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong, my new book, is the story of a great artist who was also a good man. A genius who was born in the gutter--and became a celebrity known in every corner of the world. A beloved entertainer who was more complex--and much tougher--than his fans ever imagined. It's not the first Armstrong biography, but it's the first one to tell Satchmo's story accurately. I based it in part on hundreds of private, after-hours recordings made by Armstrong himself, candid tapes in which he tells the amazing tale of his ascent to stardom in blunt, plainspoken language. I'm the first biographer to have had access to those tapes. Read Pops and you'll learn the facts about his 1930 marijuana arrest, his life-threatening run-in with the gangsters of Chicago, his triumphant Broadway and Hollywood debuts, his complicated love life, and much, much more. You'll also come away understanding exactly what it was that made him the most influential jazz musician of the twentieth century, an entertainer so irresistibly magnetic that he knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts four decades after he cut his first record. If you've ever thrilled to the sounds of ""West End Blues,"" ""Mack the Knife,"" ""Hello, Dolly!"" or ""What a Wonderful World,"" this is the book for you and yours. Give Pops a read and find out all about the man from New Orleans who changed the face of American music. Sincerely yours, Terry Teachout (Photo © Ken Howard)      Amazon Exclusive: Terry Teachout's Top 10 Louis Armstrong Recordings  In Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong, I tell the story of a beloved giant of jazz whose greathearted, larger-than-life personality shone through every record he made. Here are ten of my special favorites: 1. ""I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues"" (1933). Of all Louis Armstrong's records, this is the one I love best. Listen to how he floats atop the beat in the last chorus--he sounds just like a tenor going for a high C. 2. ""West End Blues"" (1928). The most celebrated of all Armstrong recordings and the quintessence of swing."" 3. ""Hotter Than That"" (1927). “I just played the way I sang,"" Pops said. His wordless vocal on this Hot Seven track proves it. 4. ""Star Dust"" (1931). Further proof: listen to how he rewrites the lyrics to this familiar Hoagy Carmichael ballad. 5. ""Darling Nelly Gray"" (1937). Satchmo transforms an old slave song, backed up by the suavely swinging Mills Brothers. 6. ""Jeepers Creepers"" (1939). A charming souvenir of Armstrong's film career--he introduced this Johnny Mercer song in ""Going Places."" 7. ""Struttin' with Some Barbecue"" (1938). A boiling-hot big-band remake of a classic 1927 Hot Five side in which the trumpeter improves on perfection. 8. ""You Rascal, You"" (1950). Louis meets Louis in this raucous romp through an Armstrong standard, accompanied to high-spirited effect by Louis Jordan's Tympany Five. 9. ""New Orleans Function"" (1950). An old-time New Orleans jazz funeral recreated by the All Stars, with Earl Hines on piano and Jack Teagarden on trombone. 10. ""Sleepy Time Down South"" (1941). Armstrong's theme song, an irreplaceable example of his rich and resplendent lyricism.

Terryl L. Givens,By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture That Launched a New World Religion,,English,,"With over 100 million copies in print, the Book of Mormon has spawned a vast religious movement, but it remains little discussed outside Mormon circles. Now Terry L. Givens offers a full-length treatment of this influential work, illuminating the varied meanings and tempestuous impact of this uniquely American scripture. Givens examines the text's role as a divine testament of the Last Days and as a sacred sign of Joseph Smith's status as a modern-day prophet. He assesses its claim to be a history of the pre-Columbian peopling of the Western Hemisphere, and later explores how the Book has been defined as a cultural product--the imaginative ravings of a rustic religion-maker. Givens further investigates its status as a new American Bible or Fifth Gospel, one that displaces, supports, or, in some views, perverts the canonical Word of God. Finally, Givens highlights the Book's role as the engine behind what may become the next world religion.

As a pathologist in a major metropolitan city, she has seen more than her share of corpses every day–many of them victims of violent murder.

Because never before has the lifeless body on the medical examiner’s table been her own.Yet there can be no denying the mind-reeling evidence before her shocked eyes and those of her colleagues, including Detective Jane Rizzoli: the woman found shot to death outside Maura’s home is the mirror image of Maura, down to the most intimate physical nuances.

Tess Gerritsen (Goodreads Author),The Keepsake,,English,,"New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen knows how to expertly dissect a brilliantly suspenseful story, all the while keeping fascinated readers riveted to her side. By turns darkly enthralling and relentlessly surprising, The Keepsake showcases an author at the peak of her storytelling powers.   For untold years, the perfectly preserved mummy had lain forgotten in the dusty basement of Boston’s Crispin Museum. Now its sudden rediscovery by museum staff is both a major coup and an attention-grabbing mystery. Dubbed “Madam X,” the mummy–to all appearances, an ancient Egyptian artifact– seems a ghoulish godsend for the financially struggling institution. But medical examiner Maura Isles soon discovers a macabre message hidden within the corpse–horrifying proof that this “centuries-old” relic is instead a modern-day murder victim.  To Maura and Boston homicide detective Jane Rizzoli, the forensic evidence is unmistakable, its implications terrifying. And when the grisly remains of yet another woman are found in the hidden recesses of the museum, it becomes chillingly clear that a maniac is at large–and is now taunting them. Archaeologist Josephine Pulcillo’s blood runs cold when the killer’s cryptic missives are discovered, and her darkest dread becomes real when the carefully preserved corpse of yet a third victim is left in her car like a gruesome offering–or perhaps a ghastly promise of what’s to come.  The twisted killer’s familiarity with post-mortem rituals suggests to Maura and Jane that he may have scientific expertise in common with Josephine. Only Josephine knows that her stalker shares a knowledge even more personally terrifying: details of a dark secret she had thought forever buried.  Now Maura must summon her own dusty knowledge of ancient death traditions to unravel his twisted endgame. And when Josephine vanishes, Maura and Jane have precious little time to derail the Archaeology Killer before he adds another chilling piece to his monstrous collection.",Rizzoli & Isles #7,,,August 1st 2008,"['Maura Isles', 'Jane Rizzoli', 'Father Daniel Brophy', 'Barry Frost', 'Josephine Pulcillo', 'Bradley Rose', 'Jimmy Otto', 'Media Summer']",Hardcover,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Murder Mystery', 'Detective', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']",,9780345497628,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320502170l/2653622.jpg,4.09,['LovelyBooks Leserpreis Nominee for Krimi (2009)'],215.0,3.0,,2653622-the-keepsake,,,,,96.0,36847.0,349,,Ballantine Books,"['13227', '15477', '6835', '945', '363']",,,"['Boston, Massachusetts (United States)']",,

But hospitals, wheelchairs, and loss of language couldn’t hold back such a woman; she and her husband would see Italy together, come what may. Thus Fontaine became free to follow her own piper, a literal giant inviting her to “come play” in the World of Wonders, America’s last traveling sideshow. How could she resist?Transformed into an escape artist, a snake charmer, and a high-voltage Electra, Fontaine witnessed the marvels of carnival life: intense camaraderie and heartbreak, the guilty thrill of hard-earned cash exchanged for a peek into the impossible, and, most marvelous of all, the stories carnival folks tell about themselves. Through these, Fontaine trained her body to ignore fear and learned how to keep her heart open in the face of loss. A story for anyone who has ever imagined running away with the circus, wanted to be someone else, or wanted a loved one to live forever, The Electric Woman is ultimately about death-defying acts of all kinds, especially that ever constant: good old-fashioned unconditional love.",,,,May 17th 2018,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Autobiography', 'Family', 'Contemporary', 'Road Trip', 'Travel']",,9781912240203,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513074241l/37459167._SY475_.jpg,3.92,[],100.0,1.0,,37459167-the-electric-woman,,,,,94.0,1086.0,244,,Sandstone Press,"['315', '444', '262', '50', '15']",,,[],,

She spends her days on a secluded Kansas farm with other blood witches, practicing spells for healing and trying to avoid boring lessons like algebra and history. Wild and confident, Mab uses magic to understand her entire world. But when one of Mab's spells mistakenly taps into a powerful, long-dormant curse, she finds her magic spinning out of control - and crashing right into Will Sanger, a boy from town. Will has always relied on the logical, tangible things in his life, like his dogs, his soccer team, and even his complicated family. So he tries to dismiss all he sees and feels around Mab.

"The Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, George Harrison",The Beatles Anthology,,English,,"This extraordinary project has been made possible because Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr have agreed to tell their combined story especially for this book. Together with Yoko Ono Lennon, they have also made available the full transcripts (including all the outtakes) of the television and video series The Beatles Anthology. Through painstaking compilation of sources worldwide, John Lennon's words are equally represented in this remarkable volume. Furthermore, The Beatles have opened their personal and management archives specifically for this project, allowing the unprecedented release of photographs which they took along their ride to fame, as well as fascinating documents and memorabilia from their homes and offices. What a book The Beatles Anthology is! Each page is brimming with personal stories and rare vintage images. Snapshots from their family collections take us back to the days when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey were just boys growing up in Liverpool. They talk in turn about those early years and how they came to join the band that would make them known around the world as John, Paul, George and Ringo. Then, weaving back and forth, they tell the astonishing story of life as The Beatles: the first rough gigs, the phenomenon of their rise to fame, the musical and social change of their heyday, all the way through to their breakup. From the time Ringo tried to take this drum kit home on the bus to their much anticipated audience with Elvis, from the making of the Sgt. Pepper album to their last photo session together at John's house, The Beatles Anthology is a once-in-a-lifetime collection of The Beatles' own memories.Interwoven with these are the recollections of such associates as road manager Neil Aspinall, producer George Martin and spokesman Derek Taylor. And included in the vast array of photographs are materials from both Apple and EMI, who also opened their archives for this project.

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God""",,"Special Nook Edition, color illus",12/29/67,February 25th 2011,[],Nook,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Church', 'Lds', 'Christian', 'Reference', 'Scripture', 'Lds Non Fiction', 'Mormonism']",,2940012200709,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302446888l/10607462.jpg,4.77,[],100.0,1.0,,10607462-the-lds-scriptures,,,,,96.0,1329.0,0,,LDS Scriptures | LDS Quadruple Combination | KJV,"['1192', '56', '33', '8', '40']",,,[],,

"The Duchess Of Northumberland (Goodreads Author), Colin Stimpson (Illustrator)",The Poison Diaries,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewAesop's Fables meets Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors in The Poison Diaries, a decidedly dark parable about an evil apothecary and his ill-treated apprentice that features brilliantly macabre illustrations by acclaimed Disney artist and designer Colin Stimpson. Weed is an orphan who is taken in by a sadistic apothecary, known only as the master, and proves to be a promising apprentice with a natural ability for the craft. Eventually, Weed's master takes him to a secret walled garden containing some of the most dangerous poisonous plants in the world. In later solitary visits to the garden, however, Weed realizes that the vegetation can communicate with him, and as he learns more about each individual plant, he also discovers precisely how the utilization of each plant's poison can gruesomely put an end to someone's life. The tremendous danger surrounding Weed's education in poisons is tragically underscored when his girlfriend, Marigold, after listening to Weed's far-from-expert instructions, experiments with belladonna and dies. Overwhelmed with grief, Weed blames his master for the death and, finally taking the advice of all the plants in the secret garden, prepares to enact vengeance Including incredibly detailed illustrations (� la National Audubon Society field guides) of a variety of poisonous plants -- belladonna, ricin, mandrake, hemlock, ergot, et al. -- iThe Poison Diaries/i is equal parts nightmarish fable, instructive botanical guide, and not-so-subtle cautionary tale.

The Editors of Time Magazine,The Reagan Paradox,,English,,"Long known as ""The Great Communicator,"" Ronald Reagan has been credited with leading an ideological renaissance of the Republican Party and has become an icon to many Republicans and party leaders. Now, ten years following his death, and twenty-five years following the end of his two terms in office, the man who was credited with so much, including ""Reaganomics,"" ending the Cold War, and ""The War on Drugs,"" has become the ideological standard-bearer for a party that bears little resemblance to the one that he helped to define. So much so, that in hindsight, many of his views and policies appear to be centrist in comparison. This provides the perfect opportunity for The Editors of TIME magazine, in conjunction with many highly-regarded and well-respected writers and journalists familiar with Reagan, including Lou Cannon, Jon Meacham, Nick Clooney, Bob Spitz, and more with an introduction by Joe Scarborough, to examine the man, the politician, and the President, and the paradox of an ideological hero who no longer represents the party that he helped to define, or in fact, does he?",,,,September 16th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,['Politics'],,B00K8ETDJW,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411504284l/23266015.jpg,4.13,[],98.0,1.0,,23266015-the-reagan-paradox,,,,,100.0,15.0,224,,TIME Books,"['6', '5', '4', '0', '0']",,,[],,

As its population grew, the settled areas expanded westward from the Delaware River beyond early important landmarks such as Christ Church, the Pennsylvania State House, and Pennsylvania Hospital. By the mid-19th century, commercial, religious, and cultural institutions arose along Broad Street, and exclusive residential neighborhoods developed even farther west in areas previously undeveloped or used as industrial sites. Bustling shopping districts anchored by stores such as Wanamaker's Grand Depot and Strawbridge and Clothier ran for blocks along Chestnut and Market Streets.

The RZA,The Tao of Wu,,English,,"A unique book of wisdom and experience that reaches from the most violent slums of New York City to the highest planes of spiritual thought by the RZA, hip-hop?s most exalted wise man. The RZA, the Abbot of the Wu-Tang Clan and hip-hop culture?s most dynamic genius, imparts the lessons he?s learned on the journey that?s taken him from the Staten Island projects to international superstar, all along the way a devout student of knowledge in every form he?s found it?on the streets, in religion, in martial arts, in chess, in popular culture. Part chronicle of an extraordinary life and part spiritual and philosophical discourse, The Tao of Wu is a nonfiction Siddhartha for the hip-hop generation ?an engaging, seeking book that will enlighten, entertain, and inspire. The legions of Wu-Tang fans are accustomed to this heady mix?their obsession with the band?s puzzlelike lyrics and elaborate mythology has propelled the group through fifteen years of dazzling, multiplatform success. In his 2005 bestseller The Wu-Tang Manual, the RZA provided the barest glimpse of how that mythology worked. In The Tao of Wu, he takes us deep inside the complex sense of wisdom and spirituality that has been at the core of his commercial and creative success. The book is built around major moments in the RZA?s life when he was faced with a dramatic turning point, either bad (a potential prison sentence) or good (a record deal that could pull his family out of poverty), and the lessons he took from each experience. His points of view are always surprising and provocative, and reveal a profound, genuine, and abiding wisdom?consistently tempered with humor and peppered with unique, colloquial phraseology.

"The RZA, Chris Norris",The Wu-Tang Manual,,English,,"Long awaited and much anticipated, The Wu-Tang Manual is The RZA’s first written introduction to the philosophy and history of Hip-Hop’s original Dynasty, the Wu-Tang Clan.Since the release of the revolutionary Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) — over the course of four seminal group albums and a multitude of ambitious side projects — the Wu-Tang Clan has constantly redefined what hip-hop can do and where hip-hop can go. Now, after a decade of dark beats and mysterious lyrics hinting at a larger whole, the RZA, the abbot of the legendary Staten Island hip-hop collective, fully reveals, for the first time, the complex, multilayered Wu-Tang Universe in The Wu-Tang Manual.Written in a style that is at once personal and philosophical, The Wu-Tang Manual unravels the intricate web of personalities (and alter egos), warrior codes, numerological systems, and Eastern spiritual ethics that define the Wu-Tang dynasty. Packed with information that reflects the breadth and depth of the RZA’s — and rest of the Clan’s — intellectual interests and passions, The Wu-Tang Manual is divided into four books of nine chambers each, for a total of 36 chambers. All together, the book provides the breakdown of essential Wu-Tang components, from basic information about each of the nine core members of Wu-Tang Clan to deeper explorations of the key themes of the Wu-Tang universe, a dictionary-like Wu-Slang lexicon, and an entire section of Wu-Tang lyrics with densely annotated explanations of what they mean.Elegantly laid-out and richly printed, the book is designed to reflect the Asian influence on the Wu-Tang universe, which, as the book explains, began with a fascination with kung-fu movies but quickly led to serious study of martial arts and Eastern philosophy and spirituality. The book also includes a map of Shaolin; a trove of never-before-seen photos of the Wu-Tang Clan, including shots of RZA’s trip to China with Sifu Shi Yan-Ming, live shots, and portraits-by Michael Lavine, Craig Wetherby, Sophia Chang, and Frank151; and original illustrations of many of the guiding lights of the Wu-Tang universe.

Theodor Herzl,Der Judenstaat,,German,,"Klassiker aus dem Jahr 2008 im Fachbereich Germanistik - Neuere Deutsche Literatur, -, Sprache: Deutsch, Anmerkungen: In der Fassung von 1896, Abstract: Vorrede. Der Gedanke, den ich in dieser Schrift ausf hre, ist ein uralter. Es ist die Herstellung des Judenstaates. Die Welt widerhallt vom Geschrei gegen die Juden, und das weckt den eingeschlummerten Gedanken auf. Ich erfinde nichts, das wolle man sich vor Allem und auf jedem Punkte meiner Ausf hrungen deutlich vor Augen halten.

Theodor Mommsen,A History of Rome,,English,,"The classical historian Theodor Mommsen (1817 1903) published his monumental History of Rome between 1854 and 1856. His work was received with widespread acclaim by the scholarly community and the reading public. In 1902 Mommsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and acclaimed as 'the greatest living master of the art of historical writing'. Mommsen rejected traditional Enlightenment accounts, which glorified ancient Rome; instead, guided by a new and rigorous criticism of sources, Mommsen began the demythologisation of Roman history. In a vivacious and engaging style, Mommsen drew bold parallels between the nineteenth century and classical Rome. Information about this Folio Society edition (taken from the Editorial Note):Theodor Mommsen’s Römische Geschichte was first published in three volumes between 1854 and 1856, and was subsequently revised several times. The text of the present volume is derived from William Purdie Dickson’s translation, first published in four volumes by Richard Bentley in London in 1868, of the fourth German edition.The text printed in the ensuing pages preserves slightly less than half of the 1868 edition’s three-quarters of a million words. In abridging a work of such magnitude, strict guiding principles tend to be honoured as much in their breach as in their observance. With that caveat in mind, therefore, the intention in this edition has been to provide, within a single volume, a continuous narrative of the history of Rome, from the origins of the city down to the Civil War that resulted in the sole rule of Julius Caesar (c.753—46BC). At the same time, it is hoped that the selection represents the essential character of Mommsen’s historical vision, and can be read with both pleasure and profit by a non-specialist audience.In pursuit of these goals, the relative amount of space devoted to each of the main periods of Roman history has been preserved, and Mommsen’s own book divisions and titles retained. Similarly, the original chapter titles and breaks—and indeed even the paragraphing—has been followed as closely as possible. Wirth some obvious exceptions, marginal precedence has been given to social and constitutional developments, and to political events and conflicts in Rome and Italy, over foreign policy and the detailed narration of overseas wars. Consequently, the significant amount of background information that Mommsen provided concerning the foreign nations with which Rome came into violent contact—Etruscans, Celts, Carthaginians and the peoples of the Hellenistic eastern Mediterranean among them—has been almost entirely excised. And the summaries on literature and the arts that were tacked on to the end of each book have also had to be omitted. Within these broad parameters, however, every effort has been made to ensure that the full spectrum of Mommsen's themes, methodology, and style is portrayed.So that the text retains its readability, all cuts have been made silently, without the distraction of frequent ellipses. Where it has proved impossible to provide a continuous narrative in Mommsen’s own words, then editorial linking passages, printed in smaller type than the rest of the text, have been supplied. These confine themselves to the bare essentials and take a deliberately conservative line in order to sit more comfortably with the main narrative. the new maps and extensive chronology are also intended to compensate for information otherwise excised. A handful of editorial footnotes and other brief interpolations have been added where essential for sense. All such additions to the original text, as well as any other localised rewordings necessitated by the cuts, are contained within square brackets. Most of Mommsen’s analogies to subsequent historical events, which are one of the many delights of his work, require no explanation for an educated readership.Any attempt to update Mommsen’s scholarship would be presumptuous, if not completely foolhardy, and so all points of fact and interpretation have been allowed to stand without comment. thus, for example, Mommsen’s belief that Caesar was probably born in 102BC—rather than 100 BC, as is now generally accepted—has not been amended. Nor has it been deemed necessary to bring into line with current accepted norms either the spelling of proper nouns or Disckon’s faithful equivalents of Mommsen’s deliberately idiosyncratic and anachronistic rendition of Latin terms. Of these, the most noticeable is undoubtedly the word ‘burgess’ instead of ‘citizen’. While proving that few things date faster than modernity, they also provide an important reminder that Mommsen wrote his history with the pressing political and national issues facing both pre-unification Germany and the rest of the mid-nineteenth0century Europe directly in mind.",History of Rome #1-5,abridged,10/30/55,2006,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Nobel Prize', 'Ancient History', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Germany', 'Historical', 'World History', 'Ancient']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1218697631l/4148167.jpg,4.38,[],99.0,1.0,,4148167-a-history-of-rome,,,,,96.0,221.0,771,,The Folio Society,"['129', '59', '25', '5', '3']",,,[],,

"Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Gunzelin Schmid Nörr (Editor), Edmund Jephcott (Translator)",Dialectic of Enlightenment: Philosophical Fragments,,English,,"Dialectic of Enlightenment is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. ""What we had set out to do,"" the authors write in the Preface, ""was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism.""Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present. The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization.Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. ""Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology."" This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book.This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.",,,11/05/44,March 13th 2007,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'History', 'German Literature', 'Academic', 'Cultural', 'School']",,9780804736336,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407813364l/85812.jpg,4.09,[],76.0,1.0,,85812.Dialectic_of_Enlightenment,,,,,93.0,6051.0,304,,Stanford University Press,"['2611', '1928', '1085', '293', '134']",,,[],,
Theodore Dalrymple,Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass,,English,,"Here is a searing account-probably the best yet published-of life in the underclass and why it persists as it does. Theodore Dalrymple, a British psychiatrist who treats the poor in a slum hospital and a prison in England, has seemingly seen it all. Yet in listening to and observing his patients, he is continually astonished by the latest twist of depravity that exceeds even his own considerable experience. Dalrymple's key insight in Life at the Bottom is that long-term poverty is caused not by economics but by a dysfunctional set of values, one that is continually reinforced by an elite culture searching for victims. This culture persuades those at the bottom that they have no responsibility for their actions and are not the molders of their own lives. Drawn from the pages of the cutting-edge political and cultural quarterly City Journal, Dalrymple's book draws upon scores of eye-opening, true-life vignettes that are by turns hilariously funny, chillingly horrifying, and all too revealing-sometimes all at once. And Dalrymple writes in prose that transcends journalism and achieves the quality of literature.",,,11/06/01,March 8th 2003,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Psychology', 'Economics', 'Essays', 'Cultural', 'Philosophy', 'Society', 'History']",,9781566635059,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348289731l/117161.jpg,4.22,[],91.0,1.0,,117161.Life_at_the_Bottom,,,,,95.0,2302.0,284,,Ivan R.

Theodore Dreiser,Jennie Gerhardt,,English,,"Jennie Gerhardt was Theodore Dreiser's second novel and his first true commercial success. Today it is generally regarded as one of his three best novels, along with Sister Carrie and An American Tragedy. But the text of Jennie Gerhardt heretofore known to readers is quite different from the text as Dreiser originally wrote it. In the tradition of the University of Pennsylvania Dreiser Edition, James L. W. West III has recaptured the text as it was originally written, restoring it to its complete, unexpurgated form. As submitted to Harper and Brothers in 1911, Jennie Gerhardt was a powerful study of a woman tragically compromised by birth and fate. Harpers agreed to publish the book but was nervous about its subject matter and moral stance. Jennie has an illegitimate child by one man and lives out of wedlock with another - but Dreiser does not condemn her for her behavior. As a requirement for publication, Harpers insisted on cutting and revising the text. Although Dreiser fought against many of the cuts and succeeded in restoring some material, Harpers shortened the text by 16,000 words and completely revised its style and tone. These changes ultimately transformed Jennie Gerhardt from a blunt, carefully documented work of social realism to a touching love story merely set against a social background. Passages critical of organized religion and of the institution of marriage were reduced and altered. Perhaps most important, Jennie's point of view - her innate romantic mysticism - was largely edited out of the text. As a consequence, the central dialectic of the novel was skewed and the narrative thrown out of balance.",,,10/29/11,July 11th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'American', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'The United States Of America', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'American Classics']",,9780812219555,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349037076l/307794.jpg,4.05,[],237.0,3.0,,307794.Jennie_Gerhardt,,,,,94.0,2665.0,448,,Pine Street Books,"['1013', '962', '527', '128', '35']",,,[],,

Dr. Rubin looks of how self-hate begins, is sustained, and eventually leads to destructive and defeating behavior—from alcoholism and drug dependency to perfectionism and fear of failure (or success). Offering practical and reassuring advice, he shows that the key to freeing yourself from these restricting emotions and habits is to find and examine the self-hate that generates them, and then to release your innate and powerful capacity for compassion.

The result is a comprehensive challenge to the fundamental values and assumptions of the modern technology-driven world, pinning the cause of the rapidly unfolding catastrophe on technology itself, while offering a realistic hope for ultimate recovery.Note: Theodore John Kaczynski does not receive any remuneration for this book.",,,10/30/10,July 2nd 2019,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Technology', 'Sociology', 'True Crime', 'Cultural', 'Terrorism', 'Essays', 'Ecology']",,9781944228019,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560606057l/45035203.jpg,4.1,[],97.0,1.0,,45035203-technological-slavery,,,,,94.0,631.0,355,,"Fitch Madison Publishers, LLC","['246', '241', '107', '32', '5']",,,[],,

There's Janie, who moves things without touching them, and there are the teleporting twins, who can travel ten feet or ten miles. There's Baby, who invented an antigravity engine while still in the cradle, and Gerry, who has everything it takes to run the world except for a conscience. Separately, they are talented freaks. Together, they compose a single organism that may represent the next step in evolution, and the final chapter in the history of the human race.In this genre-bending novel - among the first to have launched scifi into the arena of literature - one of the great imaginers of the twentieth century tells a story as mind-blowing as any controlled substance and as affecting as a glimpse into a stranger's soul.

Theodore Sturgeon,Venus Plus X,,English,,"Charlie Johns has been snatched from his home on 61 North 34th Street and delivered to the strange future world of Ledom. Here, violence is a vague and improbable notion. Technology has triumphed over hunger, overpopulation, pollution, even time and space. But there is a change Charlie finds even more shocking: gender is a thing of the past. Venus Plus X is Theodore Sturgeon's brilliant evocation of a civilization for whom tensions between male and female and the human preoccupation with sex no longer exist. As Charlie Johns explores Ledom and its people, he finds that the human precepts he holds dear are profane in this new world. But has Charlie learned all there is to know about this advanced society? And why are the Ledom so intent on gaining Charlie's approval? Unsettling, compelling, and no less than visionary, here is science fiction at its boldest: a novel whose wisdom and lyricism make it one of the most original and insightful speculations on gender ever produced.",,,10/30/60,October 5th 1999,[],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Gender', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Time Travel', 'LGBT', 'Utopia', 'Novels', 'Queer', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780375703744,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320421366l/845074.jpg,3.73,['Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel (1961)'],144.0,2.0,,845074.Venus_Plus_X,,,,,91.0,1765.0,224,,Vintage,"['427', '643', '535', '118', '42']",,,[],,

Henry-ish plot twists, sparkling character development, and almost archetypal, why didn't I think of that? story ideas. Early Sturgeon masterpieces include ""It,"" about the violence done by a creature spontaneously born from garbage and mud, and ""Helix the Cat,"" about an inventor's bizarre encounter with a disembodied soul and the cat that saves it.

With the publication of his enduring SF classic, ""Microcosmic God,"" Sturgeon finally found his voice, combining literate, sharp-edged prose with fascinating speculative science while recounting the power struggle between a brilliant scientist, who creates his own miniature race of gadget makers, and his greedy banker. Voice found or not, every one of the stories here is readable and entertaining today because of Sturgeon's singular gifts for clever turns of phrase and compelling narrative. As Samuel R.

  Horrific tales of witchery, necromancy, ghosts, and murder. Joni thought these were myths, preserved by her ancestors in their journals... until the Caplata returned from the grave... 
  

  We cannot build the future by avenging the past... It is generally the trustful and optimistic people who can afford to retreat. The loveless and faithless ones are compelled by their pessimism to attack.
  
  - T.H. White, The Once and Future King
  
Joni had always been fascinated by the history of her family’s old, antebellum plantation. Her ancestor’s journals were filled with stories, many involving two slave girls, the older of whom was deeply involved in the ""red magic"" of the Bokors. When Messalina returns from the grave on a quest of vengeance, Joni must confront the wickedness of her own family’s past, while also embracing a truth even more ancient—that she is descended from a line of Druids. Joni is the only one who stands between Messalina and her insidious plans.      Druidess introduces a new, modern fantasy series, that takes readers on a thrilling journey into the world of Celtic and Native American mythology, Voodoo, and an eternal realm where all magic—good and evil alike—has its origins. Druidess is filled with shocking plot twists, compelling characters, and features a strong female hero.If you liked the way Anne Rice’s Mayfair witches encountered historic evils in The Witching Hour, enjoy stories of ancient demons, mythical characters, wizards, and even zombies then you’ll love Monroe’s debut contemporary fantasy. With a touch of horror, and a compelling journey of discovery into the world of Druid magic, Monroe’s Druidess is sure to keep readers enthralled from start to finish. Pick up Theophilus Monroe’s Druidess today, wrap yourself in a warm blanket, and settle in for a long night of reading—you won’t be able to put it down! ",,,,October 20th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B07JLQ33SM,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540755253l/42514635._SY475_.jpg,3.5,[],100.0,1.0,,42514635-druidess,,,,,83.0,12.0,246,,,"['2', '5', '3', '1', '1']",,,[],,

Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to ""mindfulness""—the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality.

It begins where the reader already is—in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part—and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of Peace Is Every Step encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the ""mindless"" into the mindFUL.",,,10/28/90,March 1st 1992,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Religion', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Zen', 'Audiobook']",,9780553351392,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320544155l/14572.jpg,4.31,[],291.0,4.0,,14572.Peace_Is_Every_Step,,,,,96.0,28778.0,160,,Bantam,"['15046', '9115', '3533', '736', '348']",,,[],,

Thom Jones,The Pugilist at Rest,,English,,"Thom Jones made his literary debut in The New Yorker in 1991. Within six months his stories appeared in Harper's, Esquire, Mirabella, Story, Buzz, and in The New Yorker twice more. ""The Pugilist at Rest"" - the title story from this stunning collection - took first place in Prize Stories 1993: The O. Henry Awards and was selected for inclusion in Best American Short Stories 1992. He is a writer of astonishing talent. Jones's stories - whether set in the combat zones of Vietnam or the brittle social and intellectual milieu of an elite New England college, whether recounting the poignant last battles of an alcoholic ex-fighter or the hallucinatory visions of an American wandering lost in Bombay in the aftermath of an epileptic fugue - are fueled by an almost brutal vision of the human condition, in a world without mercy or redemption. Physically battered, soul-sick, and morally exhausted, Jones's characters are yet unable to concede defeat: his stories are infused with the improbable grace of the spirit that ought to collapse, but cannot. For in these extraordinary pieces of fiction, it is not goodness that finally redeems us, but the heart's illogical resilience, and the ennobling tenacity with which we cling to each other and to our lives. The publication of The Pugilist at Rest is a major literary event, heralding the arrival of an electrifying new voice in American fiction, and a writer of magnificent depth and range.

At some stage early in our lives we adopt a “position” about ourselves which very significantly determines how we feel about ourselves, particularly in relation to other people. And for a huge portion of the population, that position is that I’m Not OK-You’re OK. This negative Life Position, shared by successful and unsuccessful people alike, contaminates our rational adult potential, leaving us vulnerable to the inappropriate, emotional reactions of our child and the uncritically learned behavior programmed into our parent. By exploring the four basic “life positions,” we can radically change our lives.",,,11/06/67,July 6th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Relationships', 'Mental Health', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'Counselling']",,9780060724276,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348146688l/134353.jpg,3.75,[],87.0,1.0,,134353.I_m_OK_You_re_OK,,,,,89.0,16506.0,320,,Harper Perennial,"['4692', '5210', '4781', '1435', '388']",,,[],,

As the other guests wait impatiently, they are seen through the critical eye of the narrator, who begins a silent but frenzied, sometimes maniacal, and often ambivalent tirade against these former friends, most of whom were brought together by the woman whom they had buried that day. Reflections on Joana's life and suicide are mixed with these denunciations until the famous actor arrives, bringing a culmination to the evening for which the narrator had not even thought to hope.""Mr. Bernhard's portrait of a society in dissolution has a Scandinavian darkness reminiscent of Ibsen and Strindberg, but it is filtered through with a minimalist prose. . . .

He shows us why it is important for us to respond to the Earth’s need for planetary renewal, and what we must do to break free of the “technological trance” that drives a misguided dream of progress.

In Religio Medici Browne mulls over the relation between his medical profession and his profession of the Christian faith, pondering the respective claims of science and religion, questions that are still very much alive today. The discovery of an ancient burial site in an English field prompted Browne to write Urne-Buriall, which is both an early  anthropological examination of different practices of interment and a profound meditation on mortality.

"Thomas Bulfinch, Alberto Manguel (Goodreads Author) (Introduction)",Bulfinch's Mythology,,English,,"For almost a century and a half, Bulfinch's Mythology has been the text by which the great tales of the gods and goddesses, Greek and Roman antiquity; Scandinavian, Celtic, and Oriental fables and myths; and the age of chivalry have been known.         The stories are divided into three sections: The Age of Fable or Stories of Gods and Heroes (first published in 1855); The Age of Chivalry (1858), which contains King Arthur and His Knights, The Mabinogeon, and The Knights of English History; and Legends of Charlemagne or Romance of the Middle Ages (1863). For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, and for the sagas of the north, from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. He provides lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas; the joys of Valhalla and the furies of Thor; and the tales of Beowulf and Robin Hood. The tales are eminently readable. As Bulfinch wrote, ""Without a knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated. . . . Our book is an attempt to solve this problem, by telling the stories of mythology in such a manner as to make them a source of amusement.""Thomas Bulfinch, in his day job, was a clerk in the Merchant's Bank of Boston, an undemanding position that afforded him ample leisure time in which to pursue his other interests.

Thomas Cahill,How the Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe ,,English,,"From the fall of Rome to the rise of Charlemagne - the ""dark ages"" - learning, scholarship, and culture disappeared from the European continent. The great heritage of western civilization - from the Greek and Roman classics to Jewish and Christian works - would have been utterly lost were it not for the holy men and women of unconquered Ireland. In this delightful and illuminating look into a crucial but little-known ""hinge"" of history, Thomas Cahill takes us to the ""island of saints and scholars, "" the Ireland of St. Patrick and the Book of Kells. Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the west's written treasures. With the return of stability in Europe, these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning. Thus the Irish not only were conservators of civilization, but became shapers of the medieval mind, putting their unique stamp on western culture.",The Hinges of History #1,,02/15/95,February 1st 1996,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Ireland', 'Irish Literature', 'Historical', 'Religion', 'European History', 'Medieval', 'World History', 'Christianity']",,9780385418492,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403191471l/25669.jpg,3.81,[],208.0,4.0,,25669.How_the_Irish_Saved_Civilization,,,,,90.0,39970.0,246,,Bantam Doubleday Dell (NYC),"['11808', '14283', '9703', '2832', '1344']",,,['Ireland'],,
Thomas Cahill,Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus,,English,,"Cahill's most daring and provocative subject yet: Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure of Western civilization.In Desire of the Everlasting Hills, Thomas Cahill takes up his most daring and provocative subject yet: Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure of Western civilization.Introducing us first to ""the people Jesus knew,"" Thomas Cahill describes the oppressive Roman political presence, the pervasive Greek cultural influence, and especially the widely varied social and religious context of the Judaism in which Jesus moved and flourished. These backgrounds, essential to a complete understanding of Jesus, lead to the author's stunningly original interpretation of the New Testament--much of it based on material from the ancient Greek brilliantly translated by the author himself--that will delight readers and surprise even biblical scholars.Thomas Cahill's most unusual skill may lie in his ability to bring to life people of a faraway world whose concerns seem at first to be utterly removed from the present day. We see Jesus as a real person, sharp-witted and sharp-tongued, but kind, humorous, and affectionate, shadowed by the inevitable climax of crucifixion, the cruelest form of execution ever devised by humankind. Mary, while not quite the ""perpetual virgin"" of popular piety, is a vivid presence and forceful influence on her son. And the apostle Paul, the carrier of Jesus' message and most important figure in the early Jesus movement (which became Christianity), finds rehabilitation in Cahill's realistic, revealing portrait of him.The third volume in the Hinges of History series, this unique presentation of Jesus and his times is for believers and nonbelievers alike (for Jews and Christians, it is intended by the author as an act of reconciliation). With the same lively narration and irresistible perceptions that characterize How the Irish Saved Civilization and The Gifts of the Jews, Thomas Cahill invites readers into an ancient world to commune with some of the most influential people who ever lived.",The Hinges of History #3,,11/06/99,February 13th 2001,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Spirituality', 'Christian', 'Faith', 'World History', 'Judaism']",,9780385483728,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320443054l/775405.jpg,3.96,[],57.0,1.0,,775405.Desire_of_the_Everlasting_Hills,,,,,95.0,2368.0,368,,Anchor,"['740', '939', '566', '94', '29']",,,[],,
Thomas Cahill,Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter,,English,,"In the fourth volume of the acclaimed Hinges of History series, Thomas Cahill brings his characteristic wit and style to a fascinating tour of ancient Greece.The Greeks invented everything from Western warfare to mystical prayer, from logic to statecraft. Many of their achievements, particularly in art and philosophy, are widely celebrated; other important innovations and accomplishments, however, are unknown or under-appreciated. In Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea, Thomas Cahill explores the legacy, good and bad, of the ancient Greeks. From the origins of Greek culture in the migrations of armed Indo-European tribes into Attica and the Peloponnesian peninsula, to the formation of the city-states, to the birth of Western literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, art, and architecture, Cahill makes the distant past relevant to the present.Greek society is one of the two primeval influences on the Western world: While Jews gave us our value system, the Greeks set the foundation and framework for our intellectual lives. They are responsible for our vocabulary, our logic, and our entire system of categorization. They provided the intellectual tools we bring to bear on problems in philosophy, mathematics, medicine, physics, and the other sciences. Their modes of thinking, considered in classical times to be the pinnacle of human achievement, are largely responsible for the shape that the Christian religion took. But, as Cahill points out, the Greeks left a less appealing bequest as well. They created Western militarism and, in making the warrior the ultimate ideal, perpetrated the assumption that only males could be entrusted with the duties of citizenship. The consequences of their exclusion of women from the political sphere and the social segregation of the sexes continue to reverberate today. Full of surprising, often controversial, insights, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea is a remarkable intellectual adventure—conducted by the most companionable guide imaginable. Cahill’s knowledge of his sources is so intimate that he has made his own fresh translations of the Greek lyric poets for this volume.",The Hinges of History #4,,11/06/03,July 27th 2004,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Greece', 'Ancient History', 'Philosophy', 'European History', 'World History', 'Religion', 'Ancient', 'Audiobook']",,9780385495547,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406649017l/27200.jpg,3.77,[],69.0,1.0,,27200.Sailing_the_Wine_Dark_Sea,,,,,91.0,2817.0,352,,Anchor,"['698', '1074', '787', '204', '54']",,,[],,
Thomas Cahill,"Mysteries of the Middle Ages: The Rise of Feminism, Science and Art from the Cults of Catholic Europe",,English,,"After the long period of cultural decline known as the Dark Ages, Europe experienced a rebirth of scholarship, art, literature, philosophy, and science and began to develop a vision of Western society that remains at the heart of Western civilization today.By placing the image of the Virgin Mary at the center of their churches and their lives, medieval people exalted womanhood to a level unknown in any previous society. For the first time, men began to treat women with dignity and women took up professions that had always been closed to them. The communion bread, believed to be the body of Jesus, encouraged the formulation of new questions in philosophy: Could reality be so fluid that one substance could be transformed into another? Could ordinary bread become a holy reality? Could mud become gold, as the alchemists believed? These new questions pushed the minds of medieval thinkers toward what would become modern science. Artists began to ask themselves similar questions. How can we depict human anatomy so that it looks real to the viewer? How can we depict motion in a composition that never moves? How can two dimensions appear to be three? Medieval artists (and writers, too) invented the Western tradition of realism. On visits to the great cities of Europe—monumental Rome; the intellectually explosive Paris of Peter Abelard and Thomas Aquinas; the hotbed of scientific study that was Oxford; and the incomparable Florence of Dante and Giotto—Cahill brilliantly captures the spirit of experimentation, the colorful pageantry, and the passionate pursuit of knowledge that built the foundations for the modern world.

Thomas Cahill,The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels,,English,,"An enchanting journey into history, recreating a time when the actions of a small band of people had repercussions that are still felt today.The author of the runaway bestseller How the Irish Saved Civilization has done it again. In The Gifts of the Jews Thomas Cahill takes us on another enchanting journey into history, once again recreating a time when the actions of a small band of people had repercussions that are still felt today. The Gifts of the Jews reveals the critical change that made western civilization possible. Within the matrix of ancient religions and philosophies, life was seen as part of an endless cycle of birth and death; time was like a wheel, spinning ceaselessly. Yet somehow, the ancient Jews began to see time differently. For them, time had a beginning and an end; it was a narrative, whose triumphant conclusion would come in the future. From this insight came a new conception of men and women as individuals with unique destinies--a conception that would inform the Declaration of Independence--and our hopeful belief in progress and the sense that tomorrow can be better than today. As Thomas Cahill narrates this momentous shift, he also explains the real significance of such Biblical figures as Abraham and Sarah, Moses and the Pharaoh, Joshua, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.

"Thomas De Quincey, Barry Milligan (Editor)",Confessions of an English Opium Eater,,English,,"Confessions is a remarkable account of the pleasures and pains of worshipping at the 'Church of Opium'. Thomas De Quincey consumed daily large quantities of laudanum (at the time a legal painkiller), and this autobiography of addiction hauntingly describes his surreal visions and hallucinatory nocturnal wanderings through London, along with the nightmares, despair and paranoia to which he became prey. The result is a work in which the effects of drugs and the nature of dreams, memory and imagination are seamlessly interwoven, describing in intimate detail the mind-altering pleasures and pains unique to opium. Confessions of an English Opium-Eater forged a link between artistic self-expression and addiction, paving the way for later generations of literary addicts from Baudelaire to James Frey, and anticipating psychoanalysis with its insights into the subconscious.This edition is based on the original serial version of 1821, and reproduces two 'sequels', 'Suspiria de Profundis' (1845) and 'The English Mail-Coach' (1849). It also includes a critical introduction discussing the romantic figure of the addict and the tradition of confessional literature, and an appendix on opium in the nineteenth century.Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859) studied at Oxford, failing to take his degree but discovering opium. He later met Coleridge, Southey and the Wordsworths. From 1828 until his death he lived in Edinburgh and made his living from journalism.If you enjoyed Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, you might like William S.

Thomas Dubay,"Fire Within: Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and the Gospel - On Prayer",,English,,"This book is the fruit of Fr. Dubay's many years of study and experience in spiritual direction and in it he synthesizes the teachings on prayer of the two great doctors of the Church on prayer--St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila--and the teaching of Sacred Scripture.But the teaching that Fr.

"Thomas E. Gaddis, James O. Long",Panzram: A Journal of Murder,,English,,"""In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and last but not least I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all of these things I am not the least bit sorry. I have no conscience so that does not worry me. I don't believe in man, God nor Devil. I hate the whole damn human race including myself.""Carl Panzram, who called himself the ""world's worst murderer,"" wrote these words in a full autobiography and confession he prepared for the one friend in his life-a young prison guard named Henry Lesser. PANZRAM: A JOURNAL OF MURDER, combines these brutally forthright memoirs with the commentary of authors Gaddis and Long, into a compelling chronicle of the forces that engender hate. The authors provide a historical and sociological framework for Panzram's own words, using this uniquely detailed self-analysis by a mass murderer to depict what happens when an intelligent and unbreakable personality that has been interminably and unmercifully abused strikes back in vengeance.  PANZRAM arrives as a gripping warning from America's recent past to our newly repressive era of prison-industrial complex, death penalty abuse, and unprecedentedly high rates of incarceration from a man who walked the halls of Death Row with a blindingly clear vision.

Thomas E. Woods Jr.,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization,,English,,"Ask a college student today what he knows about the Catholic Church and his answer might come down to one word: ""corruption."" But that one word should be ""civilization."" Western civilization has given us the miracles of modern science, the wealth of free-market economics, the security of the rule of law, a unique sense of human rights and freedom, charity as a virtue, splendid art and music, a philosophy grounded in reason, and innumerable other gifts that we take for granted as the wealthiest and most powerful civilization in history. But what is the ultimate source of these gifts? Bestselling author and professor Thomas E. Woods, Jr. provides the long neglected answer: the Catholic Church. Woods’s story goes far beyond the familiar tale of monks copying manuscripts and preserving the wisdom of classical antiquity. In How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, you’ll learn: · Why modern science was born in the Catholic Church · How Catholic priests developed the idea of free-market economics five hundred years before Adam Smith · How the Catholic Church invented the university · Why what you know about the Galileo affair is wrong · How Western law grew out of Church canon law · How the Church humanized the West by insisting on the sacredness of all human life No institution has done more to shape Western civilization than the two-thousand-year-old Catholic Church—and in ways that many of us have forgotten or never known.

"Thomas E. Woods Jr., Kevin R.C. Gutzman (Goodreads Author)",Who Killed the Constitution?: The Assault on American Law and the Unmaking of a Nation,,English,,"“Let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”—Thomas JeffersonThe United States Constitution—the bedrock of our country, the foundation of our federal republic—is . . . dead. You won’t hear that from the politicians who endlessly pay lip service to the Constitution. It’s the dirty little secret that bestselling authors Thomas E. Woods Jr. and Kevin R. C. Gutzman expose in this provocative new book. The fact is that government officials—Democrats and Republicans, presidents, judges, and congresses alike—long ago rejected the idea that the Constitution possesses a fixed meaning limiting the U.S. government’s power. In case you’ve forgotten, this idea was not a minor aspect of the Constitution; it was the document’s very purpose. Woods and Gutzman round up the suspects responsible for the death of the government the Founding Fathers designed. Going right to the scenes of the crimes, they dissect twelve of the most egregious assaults on the Constitution—some virtually unknown. In chronicling this “dirty dozen,” the authors show that the attacks began long before presidents declared preemptive wars, congresses built pork-barrel bridges to nowhere, and Supreme Court justices began to behave as our supreme legislators. In Who Killed the Constitution? Woods and Gutzman• REVEAL the federal government’s “great gold robbery”—the flagrant assault on the Constitution you never heard about in history class• DESTROY the phony case for presidential war power• EXPOSE how the federal government has actively discriminated to end . . . discrimination• TEAR DOWN the “wall of separation” between church and state—an invention that completely contradicts what the Constitution says• DARE to touch the “third rail of American jurisprudence,” Brown v. Board of Education—showing why a government decision that seems “right” isn’t necessarily constitutionalNever shying away from controversy, Woods and Gutzman reveal an unsettling but unavoidable truth: now that the federal government has broken free of the Constitution’s chains, government officials are restrained by little more than their sense of what they can get away with.Who Killed the Constitution? is a rallying cry for Americans outraged by government run amok and a warning to take heed before we lose the liberties we are truly entitled to.",,,,July 8th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Law', 'Political Science', 'American', 'Government']",,9780307405753,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320410930l/2191970.jpg,4.14,[],140.0,2.0,,2191970.Who_Killed_the_Constitution_,,,,,94.0,291.0,288,,Crown Forum,"['127', '103', '44', '8', '9']",,,['United States of America'],,

Refuting the idea that billionaire CEOs are looking out for the interests of the little guy, he argues that ""the great euphoria of the late nineties was never as much about the return of good times as it was the giddy triumph of one America over another.""

Thomas Glavinic,Der Kameramörder,,German,," Der Ich-Erzähler verbringt mit seiner Lebensgefährtin die Osterfeiertage bei Freunden in der Steiermark. Zur allgemeinen Heiterkeit gesellt sich am Abend auch das Fernsehprogramm und damit verbunden ""die"" Neuigkeiten des Tages: ""Es wird gegen einen etwa 30jährigen, mittelgroßen Mann ermittelt, der zwei 7 u. 8 Jahre alte Kinder gezwungen hat, sich durch einen Sprung von einem hohen Baum zu töten, und diese Taten mit einer Videokamera aufgenommen hat."" Dieser Mord wird tagesbestimmend für die gesamten Osterfeiertage. Das Fernsehen versorgt sein Publikum mit Berichten und Live-Übertragungen. Interviews mit lokalen Persönlichkeiten werden ausgestrahlt, Bundespräsident und Papst ins rechte Licht gesetzt. Diese Inszenierungen werden in ihrer Perversität noch gesteigert, als ein deutscher Privatsender ankündigt, Ausschnitte aus dem Mordvideo zu senden. Das Medienspektakel findet auch Einzug in die Ferienidylle unserer vier Hauptdarsteller. Neben Osterjause und sportlichen Freizeitvergnügen greifen sie immer wieder zur Fernbedienung und zappen sich durch den News-Dschungel. Fast schon absurd wird ihr Verhalten, als ihnen die Informationsflut der TV-Kanäle nicht mehr ausreicht, und sie aktiv ins Geschehen eingreifen. Die Medien geben Themen vor, und wir richten unser Leben danach ein. Das ist wohl der Fazit des Buches. Für gute Quoten wird über Leichen gegangen, das Publikum erliegt dieser Strategie duch die eigene Sensationslust. Thomas Glavinic beschreibt diese nahezu krankhafte Konsumgier in einer Sprache, die schnörkelloser nicht sein kann. Klar und präzise protokolliert er das unfassbare Verbrechen -- dass darin eine Absicht steckt, macht das Buch spannend bis zum letzten Satz. --Henrike Blum",,,01/01/01,October 2006,[],Paperback,"['Crime', 'German Literature', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Contemporary', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Novels', 'Read For School']",,9783423135467,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1187462525l/1727625._SY475_.jpg,3.47,['Friedrich-Glauser-Preis for Kriminalroman (2002)'],97.0,1.0,,1727625.Der_Kameram_rder,,,,,80.0,891.0,156,,Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag,"['189', '281', '243', '116', '62']",,,[],,

A nationally renowned Boston cardiologist popular for his attention to the hearts and souls of his patients, Graboys was part of “The Cardiology Dream Team” summoned to treat Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis after he collapsed on the court in 1993.  He had a beautiful wife, two wonderful daughters, positions on both the faculty of Harvard Medical School and the staff of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and a thriving private practice.Today, Grayboys is battling a particularly aggressive form of Parkinson’s disease and progressive dementia, and can no longer see patients or give rounds.  He is stooped, and shuffles when he walks, the gait of a man much older than his 63 years. Despite the physical, mental and emotional toll he battles daily, Graboys continues his life-long mission of caring for the world one human being at a time by telling his story so that others may find comfort, inspiration, or validation in their own struggles.This is an unflinching memoir of a devastating illness as only a consummate physician could write it. One can’t help but imagine what Dr. Graboys, the healer, would say to Tom Graboys, the patient—a face-to-face scene imagined in this inspiring book.  In his joint roles, Thomas Graboys finds a way to convey hope, optimism and an appreciation of what it means to be truly alive.",,,,April 1st 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Medical', 'Memoir', 'Medicine', 'Health']",,9781402753411,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328857931l/2191362.jpg,3.62,[],4.0,1.0,,2191362.Life_in_the_Balance,,,,,88.0,188.0,224,,Union Square Press,"['36', '74', '55', '16', '7']",,,[],,

Instead, she married and had a son, Jason, who—like David and Diana’s father—is schizophrenic. Her husband, Mark, a geneticist, never made peace with Jason’s condition.  Perhaps this is why, when Jason drowns, Diana will not accept the authorities’ conclusion that his death was accidental. Or perhaps Diana is going mad. She begins to send David faxes and e-mails about ancient murders, driven by her growing belief that the earth is Gaia, a living witness to her son’s murder who could give evidence in the case she is building against her husband.

Thomas Hal Phillips,The Bitterweed Path,,English,,"Long out-of-print but rediscovered in this new edition, Thomas Hal Phillips' novel tells the story of two boys growing up in the cotton country of Mississippi a generation after the Civil War. Originally published in 1950, the novel's unique interest lies in its subtle treatment of same-sex love across class lines.The Bitterweed Path vividly invokes life in Mississippi at the turn of the twentieth century. In elegant prose drawing on the Old Testament story of David and Jonathan, the author tells of the relationship between two boys--one a white sharecropper's son, the other the son of the wealthy land owner, a man whose own attentions complicate the plot when they fall upon his son's friend. Part of a small body of early twentieth century gay literature, The Bitterweed Path does not sensationalize homosexuality but instead portrays it as part of a continuum of human behavior.

Thomas Hal Phillips,Red Midnight,,English,,"In a fit of rage over an insult to his father's grave, young Marcus Oday kills his friend Obie's father, is convicted of manslaughter, and is sentenced to a term in the state penitentiary.Sensitive, vulnerable, and afraid, Marcus is rescued by an older convict named Mims, who tenderly shields him from harm. In the turbulent prison world, where the jolting code phrase of ""Red Midnight"" is the signal that a prisoner has escaped, an intimate, soulful affection develops between Marcus and his guardian. It blends brotherhood, friendship, and love.When Thomas Hal Phillips's Red Midnight begins, Marcus Oday is newly paroled from prison. In some ways, he would like nothing better than to go back.Charged with mystery and vivid characterizations, the novel is a distinctive coming-of-age story that examines the bonds between family members and between friends and exposes the tensions that can tear them apart. Like other novels by Phillips, Red Midnight is set in the rustic hill country of northern Mississippi close to the primal, natural earth. The clash of human wills, the quest for new identity, and the life-altering encounter with profound friendship are Phillips's themes. His focus falls on the alienated, heart-sick hero, who, without his beloved father and his French mother, now faces life without Mims.A tale of a young man discovering himself, Red Midnight is a haunting evocation of Mississippi during the years after World War II.As the acclaimed author of five novels published in the 1940s and 1950s, Thomas Hal Phillips was in the last wave of the Southern Literary Renaissance. He went on to achieve success as a screenwriter in Hollywood, working extensively with filmmaker Robert Altman.In Red Midnight, after a forty-year absence, Phillips returns masterfully to fiction.Thomas Hal Phillips received the O.

Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish.

"Thomas Hoving, Eve Metz (Designed by)",Making the Mummies Dance: Inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art,,English,,"No museum in the world is like the Metropolitan Museum of Art - and no man has ever run it, or revolutionized it, quite like Thomas Hoving. In a decade, Hoving changed almost everything people had grown accustomed to from the Met, shaking the institution out of royal repose and transforming it into the most vital cultural presence in the country. Now, the irrepressible former director delivers a fearless account of his life at the pinnacle of the art world - a modern Vanity Fair, a true story of masterpieces and money, society and scandal, intrigue and international theft. The Met is more than a dazzling art showplace. The museum is a vibrant if quietly influential community, inhabited and run by singular sorts of people: trustees and curators, connoisseurs and conservators. It is steeped in history and tradition and seems to move in a serene and elegant world of impeccable manners and the finest taste. Behind the proper social veneers and pristine marble galleries, Hoving reveals the cutthroat precincts where the real business of the Met is carried out. From seducing important patrons like Robert Lehman, Nelson Rockefeller, Walter Annenberg, and Brooke Astor to spiriting ancient treasures across international borders; from striking secret agreements with the world's most powerful dealers to sidestepping rivals; from securing blockbuster exhibitions, like ""Tut"" and ""The Glory of Russian Costume,"" to seizing the most phenomenal Velazquez portrait, Hoving shares not only the nimbleness and brashness that made him so effective, but also the zeal and passion that made the Met so exciting. Making the Mummies Dance is told in the head-on, even naughty, way that is trademark Hoving. This is an important, shocking museum story and more - an unforgettable tale of power struggles and one-upmanship, fame, big money, and, of course, great art.",,,10/30/93,February 15th 1994,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Art History', 'History', 'Museums', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Museology', 'New York', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780671880750,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347404880l/152883.jpg,3.85,[],100.0,1.0,,152883.Making_the_Mummies_Dance,,,,,91.0,948.0,448,,Touchstone,"['289', '339', '234', '58', '28']",,,[],,

Thomas J.,Justified: The Story Of Caterrious Mitchell,,,,"Growing up in the hardened streets of Newport News, Virginia, Caterrious Mitchell, is an exceptional teenager who excels in school, avoids conflict and works part-time job to support his growing family.  However, when Caterrious is mistaken for a criminal on the run, it sets in motion a sequence of events that not only shakes his faith in the justice system but challenges legal precedent and turns the city against itself.  More importantly, ‘The story of Caterrious Mitchell’ raises a question, if a persons’ life is legitimate danger, does he have a right to defend himself, even if that person wears a badge?  “Every page of ‘Justified’ is so emotional and powerful that it will keep you salivating for just one more chapter” ",,,,February 1st 2019,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B07MRGZZV1,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549286617l/43833982._SY475_.jpg,4.86,[],99.0,1.0,,43833982-justified,,,,,100.0,7.0,265,,,"['6', '1', '0', '0', '0']",,,[],,

Thomas J. Scheff,Being Mentally Ill: A Sociological Theory,,English,,"In incorporating social process into a model of the dynamics of mental disorders, this text questions the individualistic model favoured in current psychiatric and psychoanalytic theory. While the conventional psychiatric viewpoint seeks the causes of mental illness, Scheff views ""the symptoms of mental illness"" as the violation of residual rules - social norms so taken for granted that they are not explicitly verbalized. The sociological theory developed by Scheff to account for such behaviour provides a framework for studies reported in subsequent chapters. Two key assumptions emerge: first, that most chronic mental illness is in part a social role; and second, that societal reaction may in part determine entry into that role. Throughout, the sociological model of mental illness is compared and contrasted with more conventional medical and psychological models in an attempt to delineate significant problems for further analysis and research. This third edition has been revised and expanded to encompass the controversy prompted by the first edition, and also to re-evaluate developments in the field. New to this edition are discussions of the use of psychoactive drugs in the treatment of mental illness, changing mental health laws, new social science and psychiatric studies, and the controversy surrounding the labelling theory of mental illness itself.",,,11/06/66,December 31st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Sociology', 'Health']",,9780202305875,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348418918l/1706113.jpg,4.08,[],81.0,1.0,,1706113.Being_Mentally_Ill,,,,,96.0,25.0,234,,Routledge,"['9', '11', '4', '0', '1']",,,[],,
Thomas J. Stanley,The Millionaire Mind,,,,"The Barnes & Noble Review Who is the average millionaire? Does he eat gourmet or fast food? Does he drive fancy cars, take chic vacations, and indulge wherever and whenever he can? Or does he resole his shoes, turn off the air conditioning when he leaves the house, and spend a lot of time at home with close friends and family? Through his surveys of over 1,000 millionaires, Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., answers these questions and provides us with further insight into the thoughts and lives of this wealthy segment of the population in The Millionaire Mind.  A follow-up to Stanley's New York Times bestseller, The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind may surprise readers with its findings about the kinds of people that millionaires really are. Interestingly, many millionaires were not straight-A students in high school, nor did they attend prestigious colleges. Instead, they were often told when they were younger that they were not bright and that they would not be successful. These challenges taught them how to surmount obstacles and motivated them to try harder and to take risks to get ahead financially.  The major risks that these millionaires have taken and continue to take are financial ones. They must overcome the fear of taking risks, and they must maintain this courage throughout their adult careers. Stanley discovered that many millionaires share similarities in techniques to allay their anxieties and stay on track financially. Some of these include:   Believing in myself   Counting my blessings every day   Countering negativethoughtswith positive ones   Sharing concerns with spouse   Visualizing success   Outworking, outthinking, out-toughing the competition   Hiring talented advisors   Constantly upgrading my knowledge about my occupation   Spending considerable time planning my success   Exercising regularly   Having strong religious faith  Stanley also reveals that millionaires are very often successful in marriage as well as in work (the typical millionaire has been married to the same spouse for over twenty-five years) and that they usually lead relatively frugal, economically productive lifestyles. Perhaps most interesting to readers will be the section that Stanley devotes to how millionaires chose the career in which they would be most likely to succeed.  So don't miss out on picking apart and analyzing the thoughts and habits of millionaires with Thomas Stanley and The Millionaire Mind, a book sure to be as brilliantly revealing and fascinating as his previous bestseller on millionaires. Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., is a researcher, author, and lecturer. He has studied the wealthy for more than 25 years. The Millionaire Next Door, published in 1996, has sold more than one million copies in hardcover and nearly one million in paperback. The book has been on The New York Times Best Sellers list for more than 150 combined weeks.  His previous books include Marketing to the Affluent, which Best of Business Quarterly named one of 10 outstanding business books, Selling to the Affluent, and Networking with the Affluent.  Dr. Stanley lives in Atlanta. He was a professor of marketing at Georgia State University, where he was named Omicron Delta Kappa Outstanding Professor. He holds his doctorate from the University of Georgia in Athens.

But ultimately, this great and talented man — an accomplished architect, naturalist, and linguist — wished to be remembered primarily as the author of the Declaration of Independence. In his autobiography, begun in 1821 at the age of 77, Jefferson presents a detailed account of his young life and the period during which he wrote the Declaration. A first draft of the document is included in this edition, as are his comments on the Articles of Confederation, his experiences as a wartime governor of Virginia, minister to France and observations during the French Revolution. Also featured here are rich remembrances and insights as Jefferson recalls his roles as Washington's secretary of state and vice president under John Adams, and his life in retirement.

Thomas King,The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America,,English,,"WINNER of the 2014 RBC Taylor PrizeThe Inconvenient Indian is at once a “history” and the complete subversion of a history—in short, a critical and personal meditation that the remarkable Thomas King has conducted over the past 50 years about what it means to be “Indian” in North America.Rich with dark and light, pain and magic, this book distills the insights gleaned from that meditation, weaving the curiously circular tale of the relationship between non-Natives and Natives in the centuries since the two first encountered each other. In the process, King refashions old stories about historical events and figures, takes a sideways look at film and pop culture, relates his own complex experiences with activism, and articulates a deep and revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands.This is a book both timeless and timely, burnished with anger but tempered by wit, and ultimately a hard-won offering of hope—a sometimes inconvenient, but nonetheless indispensable account for all of us, Indian and non-Indian alike, seeking to understand how we might tell a new story for the future.From the Hardcover edition.",,,,November 13th 2012,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Canada', 'Politics', 'Race', 'Historical', 'Social Justice', 'Cultural', 'Anti Racist', 'Audiobook']",,9780385674058,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357136064l/15797509.jpg,4.19,"[""Governor General's Literary Awards / Prix littéraires du Gouverneur général for Traduction (2014)"", 'Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Non‐Fiction Book (2013)', 'CBC Canada Reads Nominee (2015)', 'British Columbia National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction (2014)', 'RBC Taylor Prize (2014)', ""Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction Nominee (2013)"", 'NAISA Prize for Best Subsequent Book (2013)']",96.0,2.0,,15797509-the-inconvenient-indian,,,,,96.0,9720.0,266,,Doubleday Canada,"['4039', '4003', '1304', '269', '105']",,,[],,

Friedman shows that we have entered an age of dizzying acceleration--and explains how to live in it. Due to an exponential increase in computing power, climbers atop Mount Everest enjoy excellent cell-phone service and self-driving cars are taking to the roads. A parallel explosion of economic interdependency has created new riches as well as spiraling debt burdens. Meanwhile, Mother Nature is also seeing dramatic changes as carbon levels rise and species go extinct, with compounding results.How do these changes interact, and how can we cope with them? To get a better purchase on the present, Friedman returns to his Minnesota childhood and sketches a world where politics worked and joining the middle class was an achievable goal. Today, by contrast, it is easier than ever to be a maker (try 3-D printing) or a breaker (the Islamic State excels at using Twitter), but harder than ever to be a leader or merely ""average."" Friedman concludes that nations and individuals must learn to be fast (innovative and quick to adapt), fair (prepared to help the casualties of change), and slow (adept at shutting out the noise and accessing their deepest values).

"Thomas Mann, Denver Lindley (Translator)","Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man: The Early Years",,English,,"Thomas Mann's final novel recounts the strange and entranced career of the gifted swindler, Felix Krull, through his childhood and early manhood. Krull is a man unhampered by moral precepts that govern the conduct of ordinary mortals, and this natural lack of scruple, coupled with his formidable mental and physical endowments, enables him to develop the arts of subterfuge and deception with astonishing success and to rise swiftly from poverty to affluence. Following Krull along the shady paths his nature has destined him to take, the reader moves through a world peopled by bizarre characters from the lowest to the highest reaches of European society. Chameleon-like, Krull readily adapts himself to the situation of the moment, and so adept in the practices of chicanery does he become that his victims almost seem to count themselves privileged. And so it is too with the women who encounter the irresistible Krull, for where Krull is, the normal laws of human behavior are in suspense.Originally the character of Felix Krull appeared in a short story Mann wrote in 1911. The story wasn't published until 1936, in the book Stories of Three Decades along with 23 other stories written from 1896 to 1929, the year in which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Much later, he expanded the original story into a novel, managing to finish and publish Part 1, ""The Early Years,"" of the Confessions of Felix Krull to great public success.

In return for twenty-four years of unparalleled musical accomplishment, he bargains away his soul - and the ability to love his fellow man.Leverkühn's life story is a brilliant allegory of the rise of the Third Reich, of Germany's renunciation of its own humanity and its embrace of ambition and its nihilism.

He conceived of the four parts–The Stories of Jacob, Young Joseph, Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph the Provider–as a unified narrative, a “mythological novel” of Joseph’s fall into slavery and his rise to be lord over Egypt. Deploying lavish, persuasive detail, Mann conjures for us the world of patriarchs and pharaohs, the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, and the universal force of human love in all its beauty, desperation, absurdity, and pain. The result is a brilliant amalgam of humor, emotion, psychological insight, and epic grandeur.Now the award-winning translator John E.

Thomas Merton,Learning to Love,Exploring Solitude and Freedom,,Religion,"Having embraced a life of solitude in his own hermitage, Thomas Merton finds his faith tested beyond his imagination when a visit to the hospital leads to a clandestine affair of the heart. Jolted out of his comfortable routine, Merton is forced to reassess his need for love and his commitment to celibacy and the monastic vocation.This astonishing volume traces Merton’s struggle to reconcile his unexpected love with his sacred vows while continuing to grapple with the burning social issues of the day – including racial conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and the Arab-Israeli conflict – visiting and corresponding with high-profile friends like Thich Nhat Hanh and Joan Baez, and further developing his writing career. Revealing Merton to be ‘very human’ in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes ‘my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a ‘solution’. And perhaps not a perfect solution either’ (11 May, 1967).",,,,1998.0,,,,0060654856,9780060654856,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U0nXswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.5,,,,,,,,,,,,382.0,,,,15.0,,,,

Thomas Mullen (Goodreads Author),The Last Town on Earth,,English,,"Set against the backdrop of one of the most virulent epidemics that America ever experienced-the 1918 flu epidemic-Thomas Mullen's powerful, sweeping first novel is a tale of morality in a time of upheaval. Deep in the mist-shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest is a small mill town called Commonwealth, conceived as a haven for workers weary of exploitation. For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town's founder, it is a haven in another sense-as the first place in his life he's had a loving family to call his own. And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities. When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired-and apparently ill-soldier presents himself at the town's doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value-love, patriotism, community, family, friendship-not to mention the town's very survival, is imperiled. Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, ""The Last Town on Earth"" is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.",,,01/01/06,August 29th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'World War I', 'Novels', 'War', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction']",,9781400065202,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388228200l/76336.jpg,3.64,['James Fenimore Cooper Prize (2007)'],96.0,1.0,,76336.The_Last_Town_on_Earth,,,,,91.0,6263.0,387,,Random House (NY),"['1047', '2594', '2036', '463', '123']",,,[],,

Gone is the clash of blocs, but replaced by what?Thomas Barnett has the answers. A senior military analyst with the U.S. Naval War College, he has given a constant stream of briefings over the past few years, and particularly since 9/11, to the highest of high-level civilian and military policymakers-and now he gives it to you. The Pentagon's New Map is a cutting-edge approach to globalization that combines security, economic, political, and cultural factors to do no less than predict and explain the nature of war and peace in the twenty-first century.Building on the works of Friedman, Huntington, and Fukuyama, and then taking a leap beyond, Barnett crystallizes recent American military history and strategy, sets the parameters for where our forces will likely be headed in the future, outlines the unique role that America can and will play in establishing international stability-and provides much-needed hope at a crucial yet uncertain time in world history.For anyone seeking to understand the Iraqs, Afghanistans, and Liberias of the present and future, the intimate new links between foreign policy and national security, and the operational realities of the world as it exists today, The Pentagon's New Map is a template, a Rosetta stone.

They have enriched lives—and destroyed them.Published anonymously in 1776, six months before the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Paine’s Common Sense was a radical and impassioned call for America to free itself from British rule and set up an independent republican government. Savagely attacking hereditary kingship and aristocratic institutions, Paine urged a new beginning for his adopted country in which personal freedom and social equality would be upheld and economic and cultural progress encouraged.  His pamphlet was the first to speak directly to a mass audience—it went through fifty-six editions within a year of publication—and its assertive and often caustic style both embodied the democratic spirit he advocated, and converted thousands of citizens to the cause of American independence.",,Great Ideas,02/14/76,September 6th 2005,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Historical', 'Essays', 'Political Science', 'American Revolution']",,9780143036258,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309209451l/161744.jpg,3.98,[],2904.0,50.0,,161744.Common_Sense,,,,,94.0,29902.0,104,,Penguin,"['10358', '10856', '6909', '1436', '343']",,,['United States of America'],,

Thomas Peele (Goodreads Author),"Killing the Messenger: A Story of Radical Faith, Racism's Backlash, and the Assassination of a Journalist",,English,,"When a nineteen-year-old member of a Black Muslim cult assassinated Oakland newspaper editor Chauncey Bailey in 2007—the most shocking killing of a journalist in the United States in thirty years—the question was, Why? “I just wanted to be a good soldier, a strong soldier,” the killer told police.   A strong soldier for whom?Killing the Messenger is a searing work of narrative nonfiction that explores one of the most blatant attacks on the First Amendment and free speech in American history and the small Black Muslim cult that carried it out. Award-winning investigative reporter Thomas Peele examines the Black Muslim movement from its founding in the early twentieth century by a con man who claimed to be God, to the height of power of the movement’s leading figure, Elijah Muhammad, to how the great-grandson of Texas slaves reinvented himself as a Muslim leader in Oakland and built the violent cult that the young gunman eventually joined. Peele delves into how charlatans exploited poor African Americans with tales from a religion they falsely claimed was Islam and the years of bloodshed that followed, from a human sacrifice in Detroit to police shootings of unarmed Muslims to the horrible backlash of racism known as the “zebra murders,” and finally to the brazen killing of Chauncey Bailey to stop him from publishing a newspaper story.   Peele establishes direct lines between the violent Black Muslim organization run by Yusuf Bey in Oakland and the evangelicalism of the early prophets and messengers of the Nation of Islam.  Exposing the roots of the faith, Peele examines its forerunner, the Moorish Science Temple of America, which in the 1920s and ’30s preached to migrants from the South living in Chicago and Detroit ghettos that blacks were the world’s master race, tricked into slavery by white devils. In spite of the fantastical claims and hatred at its core, the Nation of Islam was able to build a following by appealing to the lack of identity common in slave descendants.  In Oakland, Yusuf Bey built a cult through a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery, beating and raping dozens of women he claimed were his wives and fathering more than forty children.  Yet, Bey remained a prominent fixture in the community, and police looked the other way as his violent soldiers ruled the streets. An enthralling narrative that combines a rich historical account with gritty urban reporting, Killing the Messenger is a mesmerizing story of how swindlers and con men abused the tragedy of racism and created a radical religion of bloodshed and fear that culminated in a journalist’s murder.THOMAS PEELE is a digital investigative reporter for the Bay Area News Group and the Chauncey Bailey Project. He is also a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, Graduate School of Journalism.  His many honors include the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award for his reporting on organized crime, and the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage.

By turns horrifying and erotic, Perry’s new thriller takes us on a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that pits two women against each other: a beautiful serial killer and the detective who is determined to stop her.When the cousin of Los Angeles underworld figure Hugo Poole is found shot to death in his Portland, Oregon, home, police find nothing at the scene of the crime except several long strands of blond hair hinting that a second victim may have been involved. Hotel security tapes from the victim’s last vacation reveal an out-of-focus picture of a young blond woman entering and leaving his room. Could she also be a murder victim?Portland homicide detective Catherine Hobbes is determined to solve the case and locate the missing blonde, but her feelings, and the investigation, are complicated when Hugo hires private detective Joe Pitt to perform a parallel investigation. As Joe and Catherine form an uneasy alliance, the murder count rises–and both realize that the pretty young woman in the security tapes is not a victim at all. As Catherine follows the evidence, she finds herself in a deadly contest with an unpredictable adversary capable of changing her appearance and identity at will.

"Thomas Piketty, Arthur Goldhammer (Goodreads Author) (Translator)",Capital in the Twenty-First Century,,English,,"What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality—the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth—today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.A work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.",,,08/30/13,March 10th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'History', 'Business', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Unfinished']",,9780674430006,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390111547l/18736925.jpg,4.05,"['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year (2014)', 'Arthur Ross Book Award for Gold Medal (2015)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2014)', 'Kirkus Prize Nominee for Nonfiction (Finalist) (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Business Books (2014)', 'Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2014)', 'British Academy Medal (2014)']",399.0,5.0,,18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century,,,,,93.0,24106.0,685,,Belknap Press,"['9295', '9142', '3867', '1100', '702']",,,[],,

Thomas Pynchon,Against the Day,,English,,"Spanning the period between the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the time of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all.With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred.The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists, gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents, mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians, spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx.As an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it's their lives that pursue them.Meanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop what they're doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction.Let the reader decide, let the reader beware.

Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that ""love"" is another of those words going around at the moment, like ""trip"" or ""groovy,"" except that this one usually leads to trouble.

He warns that society suffers from an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision making—a gap that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency, but our very freedom because actual knowledge gets replaced by assumptions based on an abstract and elitist social vision f what ought to be.Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a ”landmark work” and selected for this prize ”because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.” In announcing the award, the center acclaimed Sowell, whose ”contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.”",,,,1996.0,,,,0465037380,9780465037384,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oaKSswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.38,,,,,,,,,,,,422.0,,,,720.0,,,,

Thomas Sowell,Economic Facts and Fallacies,,English,,"Economic Facts and Fallacies exposes some of the most popular fallacies about economic issues-and does so in a lively manner and without requiring any prior knowledge of economics by the reader. These include many beliefs widely disseminated in the media and by politicians, such as mistaken ideas about urban problems, income differences, male-female economic differences, as well as economics fallacies about academia, about race, and about Third World countries. One of the themes of Economic Facts and Fallacies is that fallacies are not simply crazy ideas but in fact have a certain plausibility that gives them their staying power-and makes careful examination of their flaws both necessary and important, as well as sometimes humorous.

Thomas Sowell,Intellectuals and Society,,English,,"The influence of intellectuals is not only greater than in previous eras but also takes a very different form from that envisioned by those like Machiavelli and others who have wanted to directly influence rulers. It has not been by shaping the opinions or directing the actions of the holders of power that modern intellectuals have most influenced the course of events, but by shaping public opinion in ways that affect the actions of power holders in democratic societies, whether or not those power holders accept the general vision or the particular policies favored by intellectuals. Even government leaders with disdain or contempt for intellectuals have had to bend to the climate of opinion shaped by those intellectuals.Intellectuals and Society not only examines the track record of intellectuals in the things they have advocated but also analyzes the incentives and constraints under which their views and visions have emerged. One of the most surprising aspects of this study is how often intellectuals have been proved not only wrong, but grossly and disastrously wrong in their prescriptions for the ills of society—and how little their views have changed in response to empirical evidence of the disasters entailed by those views.",,,12/10/09,January 1st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'Economics', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Cultural', 'Society', 'Education', 'Psychology']",,9780465019489,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440646714l/7285385._SY475_.jpg,4.26,[],48.0,1.0,,7285385-intellectuals-and-society,,,,,93.0,2278.0,398,,Basic Books (AZ),"['1217', '660', '241', '92', '68']",,,[],,
Thomas Sowell,Intellectuals and Race,,English,,"Thomas Sowell's incisive critique of the intellectuals' destructive role in shaping ideas about race in America Intellectuals and Race is a radical book in the original sense of one that goes to the root of the problem. The role of intellectuals in racial strife is explored in an international context that puts the American experience in a wholly new light.  The views of individual intellectuals have spanned the spectrum, but the views of intellectuals as a whole have tended to cluster. Indeed, these views have clustered at one end of the spectrum in the early twentieth century and then clustered at the opposite end of the spectrum in the late twentieth century. Moreover, these radically different views of race in these two eras were held by intellectuals whose views on other issues were very similar in both eras. Intellectuals and Race is not, however, a book about history, even though it has much historical evidence, as well as demographic, geographic, economic and statistical evidence -- all of it directed toward testing the underlying assumptions about race that have prevailed at times among intellectuals in general, and especially intellectuals at the highest levels. Nor is this simply a theoretical exercise. The impact of intellectuals' ideas and crusades on the larger society, both past and present, is the ultimate concern. These ideas and crusades have ranged widely from racial theories of intelligence to eugenics to ""social justice"" and multiculturalism.  In addition to in-depth examinations of these and other issues, Intellectuals and Race explores the incentives, the visions and the rationales that drive intellectuals at the highest levels to conclusions that have often turned out to be counterproductive and even disastrous, not only for particular racial or ethnic groups, but for societies as a whole.",,,,March 12th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'History', 'Race', 'Sociology', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Cultural', 'Society']",,9780465058723,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357613803l/16280863.jpg,4.38,[],22.0,1.0,,16280863-intellectuals-and-race,,,,,96.0,803.0,192,,Basic Books,"['456', '243', '70', '24', '10']",,,[],,

Those consequences include the steady and dangerous erosion of fundamental principles of freedom - amounting to a quiet repeal of the American revolution.

Thomas Sowell,Black Rednecks and White Liberals,,English,,"This book presents the kind of eye-opening insights into the history and culture of race for which Sowell has become famous. As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity. In addition to Black Rednecks and White Liberals, the book takes on subjects ranging from Are Jews Generic? to The Real History of Slavery.",,,04/30/05,June 1st 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Politics', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Sociology', 'Race', 'Cultural', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'American History']",,9781594030864,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386749311l/3040.jpg,4.4,[],141.0,2.0,,3040.Black_Rednecks_and_White_Liberals,,,,,97.0,4054.0,372,,Encounter Books,"['2277', '1279', '374', '85', '39']",,,['United States of America'],,

Thomas Stearns Eliot,The Waste Land and Other Writings,,,Poetry,"First published in 1922, ""The Waste Land"" is T.S. Eliot's masterpiece, and is not only one of the key works of modernism but also one of the greatest poetic achievements of the twentieth century. A richly allusive pilgrimage of spiritual and psychological torment and redemption, Eliot's poem exerted a revolutionary influence on his contemporaries, summoning forth a rich new poetic language, breaking decisively with Romantic and Victorian poetic traditions. Kenneth Rexroth was not alone in calling Eliot ""the representative poet of the time, for the same reason that Shakespeare and Pope were of theirs. He articulated the mind of an epoch in words that seemed its most natural expression."" As influential as his verse, T.S. Eliot's criticism also exerted a transformative effect on twentieth-century letter, and this new edition of The Waste Land and Other Writings includes a selection of Eliot's most important essays. In her new Introduction, Mary Karr dispels some of the myths of the great poem's inaccessibility and sheds fresh light on the ways in which ""The Waste Land"" illuminates contemporary experience.

Thomas Szasz,"A Lexicon of Lunacy: Metaphoric Malady, Moral Responsibility & Psychiatry",,English,,"Thomas Szasz is renowned for his critical exploration of the literal language of psychiatry and his rejection of officially sanctioned definitions of mental illness. His work has initiated a continuing debate in the psychiatric community whose essence is often misunderstood. Szasz's critique of the established view of mental illness is rooted in an insistent distinction between disease and behavior. In his view, psychiatrists have misapplied the vocabulary of disease as metaphorical figures to denote a range of deviant behaviors from the merely eccentric to the criminal. In A Lexicon of Lunacy, Szasz extends his analysis of psychiatric language to show how its misuse has resulted in a medicalized view of life that denies the reality of free will and responsibility. Szasz documents the extraordinary extent to which modern diagnosis of mental illness is subject to shifting social attitudes and values. He shows how economic, personal, legal, and political factors have come to play an increasingly powerful role in the diagnostic process, with consequences of blurring the distinction between cultural and scientific standards. Broadened definitions of mental illness have had a corrosive effect on the criminal justice system in undercutting traditional conceptions of criminal behavior and have encouraged state-sanctioned coercive interventions that bestow special privileges (and impose special hardships) on persons diagnosed as mentally ill.

To demonstrate his commitment to a new literary direction, he transformed his protagonist Eugene Gant into the more mature and aware George Webber.The Web and the Rock continues Wolfe's own story through George, a young writer whose works resemble Wolfe's own. The first half of this posthumously published novel describes George's evolution from small-town southern boy to struggling New York novelist and attempts to answer the brooding protagonist's question, ""What is it that a young man wants?"" The second half is devoted to his tempestuous affair with a sophisticated married woman. Ultimately, George, repulsed by the frivolous lifestyle of his wealthy mistress and her circle, retreats to Europe. But, once again, his idealism is shattered as Hitler rises to power in Germany. Disillusioned, George dreams of returning to the South of his childhood but realizes that ""you can't go home again.""",,,01/01/38,May 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Southern', 'Modern Classics']",,9780807123898,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1172094916l/138444.jpg,4.01,[],89.0,1.0,,138444.The_Web_and_the_Rock,,,,,94.0,572.0,712,,Louisiana State University Press,"['201', '218', '119', '28', '6']",,,[],,

The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer.  The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, Of Time and the River illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present.

Thurston Clarke (Goodreads Author),The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 Days That Inspired America,,English,,"
  
    
      The definitive account of Robert Kennedyâ€™s exhilarating and tragic 1968 campaign for presidentâ€”a revelatory history that is especially resonant now
    
    
      After John F. Kennedyâ€™s assassination, Robert Kennedyâ€”formerly Jackâ€™s no-holds-barred political warriorâ€”almost lost hope. He was haunted by his brotherâ€™s murder, and by the nationâ€™s seeming inabilities to solve its problems of race, poverty, and the war in Vietnam. Bobby sensed the countryâ€™s pain, and when he announced that he was running for president, the country united behind his hopes. Over the action-packed eighty-two days of his campaign, Americans were inspired by Kennedyâ€™s promise to lead them toward a better time. And after an assassinâ€™s bullet stopped this last great stirring public figure of the 1960s, crowds lined up along the countryâ€™s railroad tracks to say goodbye to Bobby. 
      With new research, interviews, and an intimate sense of Kennedy, Thurston Clarke provides an absorbing historical narrative that goes right to the heart of Americaâ€™s deepest despairsâ€”and most fiercely held dreamsâ€”and tells us more than we had understood before about this complicated man and the heightened personal, racial, political, and national dramas of his times.

Thurston Clarke (Goodreads Author),Ask Not: The Inauguration of John F.

On the January morning when John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency and stood to speak those words, America was divided, its citizens torn by fears of war. Kennedy's speech-called the finest since Lincoln at Gettysburg and the most memorable of any twentieth-century American politician-did more than reassure: it changed lives, marking the start of a brief, optimistic era of struggle against ""tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself."" Ask Not is a beautifully detailed account of the week leading up to the inaugural which stands as one of the most moving spectacles in the history of American politics. At the heart of the narrative is Kennedy's quest to create a speech that would distill American dreams and empower a new generation. Thurston Clarke's portrait of JFK during what intimates called his happiest days is balanced, revealing the President at his most dazzlingly charismatic-and cunningly pragmatic. As the snow covers Washington in a blanket of white, as statesmen and celebrities arrive for candlelit festivities, the perfectionist Kennedy pushes himself to the limit, to find the words that would capture what he most truly believed and which would far outlast his own life. For everyone who seeks to understand the fascination with all things Kennedy, the answer can be found in Ask Not.",,,11/06/04,September 15th 2005,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Presidents', 'American History', 'Historical']",,9780805079364,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312062260l/1220613.jpg,4.08,[],91.0,1.0,,1220613.Ask_Not,,,,,92.0,239.0,304,,Holt Paperbacks,"['94', '91', '36', '16', '2']",,,[],,

Tiago Rebelo,"Para ti, Uma Vida Nova",,Portuguese,,"Sempre que ia fazer surf para o Guincho, Cristina esquecia-se do resto do mundo. Para ela havia, nesses momentos, apenas o seu corpo na prancha e a imensidão azul do céu e do mar. No embalo das ondas não pensava na sua agenda totalmente preenchida, nas inúmeras solicitações que tinha enquanto mulher de um sucedido empresário da comunicação social e directora de uma recente aquisição do marido, o diário ´O Popular´. Esquecimento e desafio, era isso que procurava em cada ida ao Guincho. Mas a beleza pura e agreste daquela praia viria a evocar-lhe, um dia, bem mais do que isso, e ao contemplá-la seria invadida por uma outra beleza que se misturava com aquela, mas que tinha tonalidades incrivelmente profundas e ricas. Conheceria Miguel ali e seria ali que iria sentir a força e o espírito de um amor intenso, corajoso e rebelde, um amor que viria a mudar para sempre a tragectória da sua vida.

Tiffany Baker (Goodreads Author),The Little Giant of Aberdeen County,,English,,"A multi-generational tale with many dark aspects and a touch of witchcraft, The Little Giant of Aberdeen County is the story of Truly - a girl grown massive due to a pituitary problem. Reviled and brought up in poverty, Truly finds her calling and a future that none expected.When Truly Plaice's mother was pregnant, the town of Aberdeen joined together in betting how record-breakingly huge the baby boy would ultimately be. The girl who proved to be Truly paid the price of her enormity; her father blamed her for her mother's death in childbirth and was totally ill equipped to raise either this giant child or her polar opposite sister Serena Jane, the epitome of feminine perfection. When he, too, relinquished his increasingly tenuous grip on life, Truly and Serena Jane are separated--Serena Jane to live a life of privilege as the future May Queen and Truly to live on the outskirts of town on the farm of the town sadsack, the subject of constant abuse and humiliation at the hands of her peers. Serena Jane's beauty proves to be her greatest blessing and her biggest curse, for it makes her the obsession of classmate Bob Bob Morgan, the youngest in a line of Robert Morgans who have been doctors in Aberdeen for generations. Though they have long been the pillars of the community, the earliest Robert Morgan married the town witch, Tabitha Dyerson, and the location of her fabled shadow book--containing mysterious secrets for healing and darker powers--has been the subject of town gossip ever since. Bob Bob Morgan, one of Truly's biggest tormentors, does the unthinkable to claim the prize of Serena Jane and changes the destiny of all Aberdeen from there on. When Serena Jane flees town and a loveless marriage to Bob Bob, it is Truly who must become the woman of a house that she did not choose and mother to her eight-year-old nephew Bobbie. Truly's brother-in-law is relentless and brutal; he criticizes her physique and the limitations of her health as a result and degrades her more than any one human could bear. It is only when Truly finds her calling--the ability to heal illness with herbs and naturopathic techniques--hidden within the folds of Robert Morgan's family quilt, that she begins to regain control over her life and herself. Unearthed family secrets, however, will lead to the kind of betrayal that eventually break the Morgan family apart forever, but Truly's reckoning with her own demons allows for both an uprooting of Aberdeen County, and the possibility of love in unexpected places.",,,10/29/09,January 8th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Magical Realism', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Chick Lit', 'Fantasy', 'Book Club']",,9780446194204,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442465444l/3235139._SY475_.jpg,3.64,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2009)'],188.0,2.0,,3235139-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county,,,,,90.0,10822.0,341,,Grand Central Publishing,"['1853', '4548', '3287', '924', '210']",,,[],,

Tiffany McDaniel (Goodreads Author),Betty,,English,,"A stunning, lyrical novel set in the rolling foothills of the Appalachians in which a young girl discovers stark truths that will haunt her for the rest of her life. ""A girl comes of age against the knife."" So begins the story of Betty Carpenter. Born in a bathtub in 1954 to a Cherokee father and white mother, Betty is the sixth of eight siblings. The world they inhabit is one of poverty and violence--both from outside the family, and also, devastatingly, from within. The lush landscape, rich with birdsong, wild fruit, and blazing stars, becomes a kind of refuge for Betty, but when her family's darkest secrets are brought to light, she has no choice but to reckon with the brutal history hiding in the hills, as well as the heart-wrenching cruelties and incredible characters she encounters in her rural town of Breathed, Ohio. But despite the hardship she faces, Betty is resilient. Her curiosity about the natural world, her fierce love for her sisters, and her father's brilliant stories are kindling for the fire of her own imagination, and in the face of all she bears witness to, Betty discovers an escape: she begins to write. She recounts the horrors of her family's past and present with pen and paper and buries them deep in the dirt--moments that has stung her so deeply, she could not tell them, until now.

While she was there, she began to understand the fate that awaited the Jewish families who were unable to leave. Soon she reached out to the trapped families, going from door to door and asking them to trust her with their young children. Driven to extreme measures and with the help of a network of local tradesmen, ghetto residents, and her star-crossed lover in the Jewish resistance, Irena ultimately smuggled thousands of children past the Nazis. She made dangerous trips through the city’s sewers, hid children in coffins, snuck them under overcoats at checkpoints, and slipped them through secret passages in abandoned buildings. But Irena did something even more astonishing at immense personal risk: she kept a secret list buried in bottles under an old apple tree in a friend’s back garden. On it were the names and true identities of these Jewish children, recorded so their families could find them after the war. She could not know that more than ninety percent of their families would perish.

But over time, as she switched schools, got into art, and fell in love with her first girlfriend, she began to question how the close-minded world of figure skating fit in with the rest of her life, and whether all the work was worth it given the reality: that she, and her friends on the figure skating team, were nowhere close to Olympic hopefuls.

Tim Burton,Tim Burton,Interviews,,Biography & Autobiography,"Starting his career as an animator for Disney, Tim Burton made his feature film directorial debut with the visually dazzling, low-budget Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. When it became a surprise blockbuster, studios began to trust him with larger budgets and the whims of his expansive imagination. Mixing gothic horror, black comedy, and oddball whimsy, Burton's movies veer from childlike enchantment to morbid melancholy, often with the same frame. His beautifully designed and highly stylized films-including Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood-are idiosyncratic, personal visions that have found commercial success. In Tim Burton: Interviews, the director discusses how animation and art design affect his work, how old horror films have deeply influenced his psyche, why so many of his protagonists are outcasts, and how he's managed to make personal films within the Hollywood system. He gives tribute to writers he's worked with, his favorite actors-including Johnny Depp and Vincent Price-and talks enthusiastically about pulp horror fiction and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. These interviews show his progression from an inarticulate young director to a contemplative and dry-witted artist over the course of twenty years. In later interviews, he opens up about being in therapy and how his childhood fantasies still affect his art. Tim Burton: Interviews reveals a man who has managed to thrive inside Hollywood while maintaining the distinctive quirks of an independent filmmaker.

Tim Butcher (Goodreads Author),Blood River: A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart,,English,,"A compulsively readable account of a journey to the Congo — a country virtually inaccessible to the outside world — vividly told by a daring and adventurous journalist.Ever since Stanley first charted its mighty river in the 1870s, the Congo has epitomized the dark and turbulent history of a failed continent. However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley’s original expedition — but travelling alone.Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo’s eastern border. He passed through once thriving cities of this country and saw the marks left behind by years of abuse and misrule. Almost, 2,500 harrowing miles later, he reached the Atlantic Ocean, a thinner and a wiser man.Butcher’s journey was a remarkable feat. But the story of the Congo, vividly told in Blood River, is more remarkable still.From the Hardcover edition.",,,07/03/07,01/03/08,['Henry Morton Stanley'],Paperback,"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'History', 'Adventure', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Travelogue', 'Autobiography']",,9780099494287,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531681288l/2184798._SY475_.jpg,4.06,"['Ryszard Kapuściński Prize Nominee (2009)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2008)', 'Stanford Dolman Travel Book of the Year Nominee (2008)']",43628.0,440.0,,2184798.Blood_River,,,,,95.0,7554.0,363,,Vintage,"['2666', '3167', '1359', '261', '101']",,,"['Congo (Congo, the Democratic Republic of the)']",,

Tim Butcher (Goodreads Author),The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War,,English,,"On a summer morning in Sarajevo a hundred years ago, a teenage assassin named Gavrilo Princip fired not just the opening shots of the First World War but the starting gun for modern history, when he killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Yet the events Princip triggered were so monumental that his own story has been largely overlooked, his role garbled and motivations misrepresented.The Trigger puts this right, filling out as never before a figure who changed our world and whose legacy still has an impact on all of us today. Born a penniless backwoodsman, Princip’s life changed when he trekked through Bosnia and Serbia to attend school. As he ventured across fault lines of faith, nationalism and empire, so tightly clustered in the Balkans, radicalisation slowly transformed him from a frail farm boy into history’s most influential assassin.By retracing Princip’s journey from his highland birthplace, through the mythical valleys of Bosnia to the fortress city of Belgrade and ultimately Sarajevo, Tim Butcher illuminates our understanding both of Princip and the places that shaped him. Tim uncovers details about Princip that have eluded historians for a century and draws on his own experience, as a war reporter in the Balkans in the 1990s, to face down ghosts of conflicts past and present.The Trigger is a rich and timely work that brings to life both the moment the world first went to war and an extraordinary region with a potent hold over history.",,,,05/01/14,['Gavrilo Princip'],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War I', 'War', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'European History', '20th Century', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780701187934,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388535774l/18300212.jpg,4.11,[],9160.0,94.0,,18300212-the-trigger,,,,,95.0,1257.0,352,,Chatto & Windus,"['496', '482', '217', '44', '18']",,,[],,

Tim Capps,Judging Angels,,English,,"Christmas Eve finds renowned, but now disgraced, defense lawyer George Able paying a final visit to his two children, Brian and Sandy. It is a final visit of a different sort to his estranged wife and her lover: George has a .38 in his coat pocket. Later that night, he finds himself on a deserted highway in deep dark country with missing bullets and missing time. It looks like a Christmas Miracle, especially when he meets a beautiful redhead who offers him a second chance. But the seemingly naive Red Morgan proves to be a troubling mix of love, lethality and, possibly, lunacy.  When George’s daughter is kidnapped by a man who might be associated with Morgan, the Able family and the criminal justice system are faced with a threat they are not equipped to handle. As a rescue attempt snowballs into a crime spree from the top of Illinois to its tip, a family must put aside its problems even as moral compromises undermine their good intentions. And while Red Morgan is too useful to send away, her dream of a white Vegas wedding with George faces one obstacle...  
  Judging Angels
 is the first volume in The Rubricatae Chronicles. It draws on police procedural, urban fantasy, and heroic quest to provide the reader with an original Catholic psychological thriller that blends genres and provides more twists and tension than a murder trial. Timothy Capps, a recognized death penalty defense expert, tells this exciting, yet thoughtful, tale with the relish of a seasoned lawyer’s closing argument. And just as trials must probe the motives of defendants, the reader will discover that the real story is on the inside: ordinary people tempted to do the worst things for the best reasons.",The Rubricatae Chronicles #1,,04/27/17,May 3rd 2017,[],Paperback,[],,9780997792898,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493986144l/35067504._SY475_.jpg,4.67,['New York Book Festival Nominee for General Fiction (2017)'],96.0,1.0,,35067504-judging-angels,,,,,100.0,3.0,502,,Hope and Life Press,[],,,[],,

Tim Crothers,"The Queen of Katwe: A Story of Life, Chess, and One Extraordinary Girl's Dream of Becoming a Grandmaster",,English,,"Based on a popular ESPN magazine article selected by Dave Eggers for The Best American Nonrequired Reading and a finalist for a National Magazine Award, the inspiring true story of Phiona Mutesi, a teenage chess prodigy from the slums of Kampala, Uganda.PHIONA MUTESI sleeps in a decrepit shack with her mother and three siblings and struggles to find a single meal each day. Phiona has been out of school most of her life because her mother cannot afford it, so she is only now learning to read and write. Phiona Mutesi is also one of the best chess players in the world.One day in 2005, while searching for food, nine-year-old Phiona followed her brother to a dusty veranda where she met Robert Katende, who had also grown up in the Kampala slums. Katende, a war refugee turned missionary, had an improbable dream: to empower kids through chess—a game so foreign there is no word for it in their native language. Laying a chessboard in the dirt of the Katwe slum, Robert painstakingly taught the game each day. When he left at night, slum kids played on with bottlecaps on scraps of cardboard. At first they came for a free bowl of porridge, but many grew to love chess, a game that—like their daily lives—means persevering against great obstacles. Of these kids, one stood out as an immense talent: Phiona.By the age of eleven Phiona was her country’s junior champion and at fifteen, the national champion. In September 2010, she traveled to Siberia, a rare journey out of Katwe, to compete in the Chess Olympiad, the world’s most prestigious team-chess event. Phiona’s dream is to one day become a Grandmaster, the most elite title in chess. But to reach that goal, she must grapple with everyday life in one of the world’s most unstable countries, a place where girls are taught to be mothers, not dreamers, and the threats of AIDS, kidnapping, and starvation loom over the people.Like Katherine Boo’s Behind the Beautiful Forevers and Gayle Tzemach Lemmon’s The Dressmaker of Khair Khana, The Queen of Katwe is an intimate and heartrending portrait of human life on the poor fringes of the twenty-first century.",,,,October 9th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Africa', 'Chess', 'Uganda', 'Sports', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'History', 'Audiobook']",,9781451657814,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339800255l/13547258.jpg,3.76,[],49.0,1.0,,13547258-the-queen-of-katwe,,,,,92.0,2530.0,224,,Scribner,"['574', '1034', '713', '171', '38']",,,[],,

"Tim DeRoche (Goodreads Author), Gloria Romero (Afterword)",A Fine Line: How Most American Kids Are Kept Out of the Best Public Schools,,English,,"WHAT SIDE OF THE LINE DO YOU LIVE ON?In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled that little Linda Brown couldn't be excluded from a public school because of her race. In that landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the court famously declared that public education must be available to all on equal terms, but sixty-six years later, many of the best public schools remain closed to all but the most privileged families. Empowered by little-known state laws, school districts draw attendance zones around their best schools, indicating who is, and who isn't, allowed to enroll. In many American cities, this means that living on one side of the street or the other will determine whether you leave eighth grade on a track for future success or barely able to read.In A Fine Line, bestselling author Tim DeRoche takes a close look at the laws and policies that dictate which kids are allowed to go to which schools. And he finds surprising parallels between current education policies and the redlining practices of the New Deal era in which minority families were often denied mortgages and government housing assistance because they didn't live within certain desirable zones of the city.

His sudden death on 17 April 2014 in a horrific car accident – just a month after he was convicted of sedition in the High Court – shocked and saddened Malaysians to the core and left a deep void in the country’s legal and political landscape. Karpal was a fearless advocate for justice and a defender of human rights in South East Asia, and has appeared in the Privy Council in London on a number of occasions before such appeals were abandoned by Malaysia. He is renowned for his defence of many people from many nations who have faced the death penalty under Malaysia's Dangerous Drugs Act. In recent years, one of his biggest achievements was his successful defence of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on two charges of sodomy in 2012. On the night he died, Karpal was still fighting for Anwar, who had been convicted once again of sodomy, and seeking to reassure him. He told the Opposition leader in a telephone call he would do his best in the prosecution’s ‘fast-tracked’ Federal Court of Appeal.

Tim Jon Semmerling,"""Evil"" Arabs in American Popular Film: Orientalist Fear",,English,,"Runner-up, 2006 Arab American National Museum Book Awards, 2007The ""evil"" Arab has become a stock character in American popular films, playing the villain opposite American ""good guys"" who fight for ""the American way."" It's not surprising that this stereotype has entered American popular culture, given the real-world conflicts between the United States and Middle Eastern countries, particularly since the oil embargo of the 1970s and continuing through the Iranian hostage crisis, the first and second Gulf Wars, and the ongoing struggle against al-Qaeda. But when one compares the ""evil"" Arab of popular culture to real Arab people, the stereotype falls apart. In this thought-provoking book, Tim Jon Semmerling further dismantles the ""evil"" Arab stereotype by showing how American cultural fears, which stem from challenges to our national ideologies and myths, have driven us to create the ""evil"" Arab Other.Semmerling bases his argument on close readings of six films (The Exorcist, Rollover, Black Sunday, Three Kings, Rules of Engagement, and South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut), as well as CNN's 9/11 documentary America Remembers. Looking at their narrative structures and visual tropes, he analyzes how the films portray Arabs as threatening to subvert American ""truths"" and mythic tales--and how the insecurity this engenders causes Americans to project evil character and intentions on Arab peoples, landscapes, and cultures. Semmerling also demonstrates how the ""evil"" Arab narrative has even crept into the documentary coverage of 9/11. Overall, Semmerling's probing analysis of America's Orientalist fears exposes how the ""evil"" Arab of American popular film is actually an illusion that reveals more about Americans than Arabs.",,,,September 1st 2006,[],Paperback,[],,9780292713420,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347985461l/109387.jpg,4.5,['Arab American Book Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2007)'],93.0,1.0,,109387._Evil_Arabs_in_American_Popular_Film,,,,,,4.0,303,,University of Texas Press,[],,,[],,

"Tim Lawson, Alisa Persons",The Magic Behind the Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors,,English,,"The Magic Behind the Voices is a fascinating package of biographies, anecdotes, credit listings, and photographs of the actors who have created the unmistakable voices for some of the most popular and enduring animated characters of all time.Drawn from dozens of personal interviews, the book features a unique look at thirty-nine of the hidden artists of show business. Often as amusing as the characters they portray, voice actors are charming, resilient people-many from humble beginnings-who have led colorful lives in pursuit of success. Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill's Mike Judge was an engineer for a weapons contractor turned self-taught animator and voice actor. Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson) was a small town Ohio girl who became the star prot�g� of Daws Butler-most famous for Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and Quick Draw McGraw. Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) and Minnie Mouse (Russi Taylor) are a real-life husband-and-wife team. Spanning many studios and production companies, this book captures the spirit of fun that bubbles from those who create the voices of favorite animated characters.In the earliest days of cartoons, voice actors were seldom credited for their work. A little more than a decade ago, even the Screen Actors Guild did not consider voice actors to be real actors, and the only voice actor known to the general public was Mel Blanc. Now, Oscar-winning celebrities clamor to guest star on animated television shows and features.Despite the crushing turnouts at signings for shows such as Animaniacs, The Simpsons, and SpongeBob Squarepants, most voice actors continue to work in relative anonymity.

Tim Marshall,Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics,,English,,"In the bestselling tradition of Why Nations Fail and The Revenge of Geography, an award-winning journalist uses ten maps of crucial regions to explain the geo-political strategies of the world powers.All leaders of nations are constrained by geography. Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely Prisoners of Geography, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography? Why will Europe never be united? Why will America never be invaded?

Tim Russert,Wisdom of Our Fathers: Lessons and Letters from Daughters and Sons,,English,,"What does it really mean to be a good father? What did your father tell you, that has stayed with you throughout your life? Was there a lesson from him, a story, or a moment that helped to make you who you are? Is there a special memory that makes you smile when you least expect it?After the publication of Tim Russert’s number one New York Times bestseller about his father, Big Russ & Me, he received an avalanche of letters from daughters and sons who wanted to tell him about their own fathers, most of whom were not superdads or heroes but ordinary men who were remembered and cherished for some of their best moments–of advice, tenderness, strength, honor, discipline, and occasional eccentricity.Most of these daughters and sons were eager to express the gratitude they had carried with them through the years. Others wanted to share lessons and memories and, most important, pass them down to their own children. This book is for all fathers, young or old, who can learn from the men in these pages how to get it right, and to understand that sometimes it is the little gestures that can make the big difference for your child. For some in this book, the appreciation came later than they would have liked. But as Wisdom of Our Fathers reminds us, it is never too late to embrace it. From the father who coached his daughter in sports (and life), attending every meet, game, performance, and tournament, to the daughter who, after a fifteen-year estrangement, learned to make peace with her difficult father just before he died, to the son who came, at last, to appreciate the silent way his father could show affection, Wisdom of Our Fathers shares rewarding lessons, immeasurable gifts, and lasting values.Heartfelt, humorous, engaging, irresistibly readable, and bound to bring back memories of unforgettable moments with our own fathers, Tim Russert’s new book is not only a fitting companion to his own marvelous memoir, but also a celebration of the positive qualities passed down from generation to generation.",,,01/01/06,May 15th 2007,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Inspirational', 'Memoir', 'Parenting', 'History', 'Family', 'Self Help', 'Biography Memoir', 'Short Stories']",,9780812975437,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388303337l/367322.jpg,4.17,[],90.0,1.0,,367322.Wisdom_of_Our_Fathers,,,,,97.0,1966.0,320,,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['811', '753', '334', '58', '10']",,,[],,

Tim Slover,The Christmas Chronicles: The Legend of Santa Claus,,English,,"In this new holiday classic, Tim Slover crafts a marvelous, magical novel about how Santa Claus became the man he is today. After reading The Christmas Chronicles, you’ll believe all over again in the magic of the season.  Snow is falling, and the clock ticks toward midnight on Christmas Eve while countless children, too excited to sleep, anticipate the arrival of Santa Claus. But in Tim Slover’s deeply charming and utterly thrilling new novel, that’s the end rather than the beginning of the story. In this richly imagined tale of Santa’s origins, the man in full finally emerges. The Christmas Chronicles is at once an action-packed adventure, an inspiring story of commitment and faith, and a moving love story. It all starts in 1343, when the child Klaus is orphaned and adopted by a craftsmen’s guild. The boy will grow to become a master woodworker with an infectious laugh and an unparalleled gift for making toys. His talent and generosity uniquely equip him to bestow hundreds of gifts on children at Christmas—and to court the delightful Anna, who enters his life on a sleigh driven by the reindeer Dasher and becomes his beloved wife. Still, all is not snowfall and presents. Klaus will be shadowed by the envious Rolf Eckhof, who will stop at nothing to subvert him. But in the end, Santa’s magic is at last unleashed, flying reindeer come to his aid, and an epic battle between good and evil is waged in the frosty Christmas skies.

If a slave escaped and made his way across Bok Chitto, the slave was free.Thus begins Crossing Bok Chitto, told by award-winning Choctaw storyteller Tim Tingle and brought to life with the rich illustrations of Jeanne Rorex Bridges.Martha Tom, a young Choctaw girl, knows better than to cross Bok Chitto, but one day--in search of blackberries--she disobeys her mother and finds herself on the other side.

Tim Willocks,The Religion,,English,,"This is what we dream of: to be so swept away, so poleaxed by a book that the breath is sucked right out of us. Brace yourselves. May 1565. Suleiman the Magnificent, emperor of the Ottomans, has declared a jihad against the Knights of Saint John the Baptist. The largest armada of all time approaches the knights' Christian stronghold on the island of Malta. The Turks know the knights as the ""Hounds of Hell."" The knights call themselves ""The Religion."" In Messina, Sicily, a French countess, Carla La Penautier, seeks passage to Malta in a quest to find the son taken from her at his birth twelve years ago. The only man with the expertise and daring to help her is a Rabelaisian soldier of fortune, arms dealer, former janissary, and strapping Saxon adventurer by the name of Mattias Tannhauser. He agrees to accompany the lady to Malta, where, amid the most spectacular siege in military history, they must try to find the boy--whose name they do not know and whose face they have never seen--and pluck him from the jaws of Holy War. The Religion is the first book of the Tannhauser Trilogy, and from the first page of this epic account of the last great medieval conflict between East and West, it is clear we are in the hands of a master.

Tim Winton,Dirt Music,,English,,"Luther Fox, a loner, haunted by his past, makes his living as an illegal fisherman, a shamateur. Before everyone in his family was killed in a freak rollover, he grew melons and played guitar in the family band. Robbed of all that, he has turned his back on music. There's too much emotion in it, too much memory and pain. One morning Fox is observed poaching by Georgie Jutland. Chance, or a kind of willed recklessness, has brought Georgie into the life and home of Jim Buckridge, the most prosperous fisherman in the area and a man who loathes poachers, Fox above all. But she's never fully settled into Jim's grand house on the water or into the inbred community with its history of violent secrets. After Georgie encounters Fox, her tentative hold on conventional life is severed. Neither of them would call it love, but they can't stay away from each other no matter how dangerous it is, and out on White Point it is very dangerous.  Set in the dramatic landscape of Western Australia, Dirt Music is a love story about people stifled by grief and regret; a novel about the odds of breaking with the past and about the lure of music. Dirt music, Fox tells Georgie, is ""anything you can play on a verandah or porch, without electricity."" Even in the wild, Luther cannot escape it. There is, he discovers, no silence in nature.

Breath is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, testing one’s limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath will take you. It’s a story of extremes—extreme sports and extreme emotions. On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor’s past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife’s peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits—in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior—there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome.

Tim Winton,Eyrie,,English,,"An exhilarating new book from Australia's most acclaimed writerTim Winton is Australia's most decorated and beloved literary novelist. Short-listed twice for the Booker Prize and the winner of a record four Miles Franklin Awards for Best Australian Novel, he has a gift for language virtually unrivaled among English-language novelists. His work is both tough and tender, primordial and new - always revealing the raw, instinctual drives that lure us together and rend us apart. In Eyrie, Winton crafts the story of Tom Keely, a man struggling to accomplish good in an utterly fallen world. Once an ambitious, altruistic environmentalist, Keely now finds himself broke, embroiled in scandal, and struggling to piece together some semblance of a life. From the heights of his urban high-rise apartment, he surveys the wreckage of his life and the world he's tumbled out of love with.

Timothy Egan (Goodreads Author),The Big Burn: Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire That Saved America,,English,,"On the afternoon of August 20, 1910, a battering ram of wind moved through the drought-stricken national forests of Washington, Idaho, and Montana, whipping the hundreds of small blazes burning across the forest floor into a roaring inferno that jumped from treetop to ridge as it raged, destroying towns and timber in the blink of an eye. Forest rangers had assembled nearly ten thousand men  —  college boys, day workers, immigrants from mining camps  —  to fight the fire. But no living person had seen anything like those flames, and neither the rangers nor anyone else knew how to subdue them.Egan narrates the struggles of the overmatched rangers against the implacable fire with unstoppable dramatic force. Equally dramatic is the larger story he tells of outsized president Teddy Roosevelt and his chief forester, Gifford Pinchot. Pioneering the notion of conservation, Roosevelt and Pinchot did nothing less than create the idea of public land as our national treasure, owned by and preserved for every citizen. The robber barons fought Roosevelt and Pinchot’s rangers, but the Big Burn saved the forests even as it destroyed them: the heroism shown by the rangers turned public opinion permanently in their favor and became the creation myth that drove the Forest Service, with consequences still felt in the way our national lands are protected  —  or not —  today.",,,,October 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Biography', 'Environment', 'Nature', 'Historical', 'Politics', 'Conservation', 'Audiobook']",,9780618968411,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348837950l/6452538.jpg,4.09,"['Montana Book Award Nominee (2009)', 'Washington State Book Award for History/Biography (2010)', 'Spur Award Nominee for Best Western Nonfiction Contemporary (2010)']",87.0,1.0,,6452538-the-big-burn,,,,,96.0,13249.0,324,,Houghton Mifflin,"['4697', '5693', '2308', '420', '131']",,,[],,

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists.

This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?   “I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.   “Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I’ve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.   “I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself.

Pilgrim is a man who cannot die, an astounding character in a novel of the cataclysmic contest between creation and destruction. Pilgrim is Timothy Findley’s latest masterwork, a finalist for the Giller Prize, and a national bestseller that has smashed the author’s own impressive sales records. Recently published in the US, Pilgrim is gathering rave reviews, and will be released in the UK this spring.It is 1912 and Pilgrim has been admitted to the Burghölzli Psychiatric Clinic in Zürich, Switzerland, having failed—once again—to commit suicide. Over the next two years, it is up to Carl Jung, self-professed mystical scientist of the mind, to help Pilgrim unlock his unconsciousness, etched as it is with myriad sufferings and hopes of history. Is Pilgrim mad, or is he condemned to live forever, witness to the terrible tragedy and beauty of the human condition?

Timothy J. Keller,The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism,,English,,"Making Sense of God: An Invitation to the Skeptical, is a prequel to The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism. The End of Faith. The God Delusion. God Is Not Great. Letter to a Christian Nation. Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith, for most Americans, faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious, and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate, learned, and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years, Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced “doubts” skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in The Reason for God, he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists, agnostics, and skeptics in mind, Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. The Reason for God challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn’t Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn’t the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be “right” and the rest “wrong”? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book, Tim Keller uses literature, philosophy, real-life conversations and reasoning, and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth.",,,10/28/07,February 14th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Christian', 'Theology', 'Nonfiction', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Philosophy', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Living', 'Christian Non Fiction']",,9780525950493,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388185497l/1858013.jpg,4.17,[],261.0,4.0,,1858013.The_Reason_for_God,,,,,92.0,51525.0,293,,Dutton,"['25413', '15504', '6614', '2174', '1820']",,,[],,

Success, true love, and the life you've always wanted. Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good things -gods that can't give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravings- and now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.  The Bible tells us that the human heart is an idol- factory, taking good things and making them into idols that drive us. In Counterfeit Gods, Keller applies his trademark approach to show us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the unvarnished truth about societal ideals and our own hearts. This powerful message will cement Keller's reputation as a critical thinker and pastor, and comes at a crucial time-for both the faithful and the skeptical.",,,,October 20th 2009,[],ebook,"['Christian', 'Theology', 'Christianity', 'Nonfiction', 'Christian Living', 'Faith', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Discipleship']",,9781101148877,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1275733528l/7137645.jpg,4.34,[],100.0,1.0,,7137645-counterfeit-gods,,,,,96.0,13806.0,240,,Riverhead Books,"['7388', '4459', '1423', '326', '210']",,,[],,

Timothy Leary,Flashbacks,,English,,"With a foreword by William Burroughs, this frenetic autobiography relates the life story of Timothy Leary, one of the key figures of the1960s North American counterculture, and the primary proponent of psychedelia as a way of life. Leary’s controversial views made him a public enemy in the United States, where he was eventually arrested in 1970 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. His escape from prison, and subsequent flight, with the help of the Weathermen, first to Algeria, then to Switzerland, Vienna, Beirut, and finally Kabul, Afghanistan, read like something out of a novel. Other events in Leary’s life were no less dramatic, and he chronicles them in this book openly and energetically. Intriguing cameos of iconic figures are woven into the author’s life history, including one by Cary Grant, whose experiments with lysergic acid are described in detail. Ultimately, Timothy Leary’s memories are as much a record of a singular era in American history as they are one man’s recollections of a struggle against persecution and being ostracized.",,,1983,March 17th 1997,[],Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Science']",,9780874778700,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171046059l/83491.jpg,4.09,[],6.0,1.0,,83491.Flashbacks,,,,,95.0,654.0,407,,Tarcher,"['263', '235', '122', '22', '12']",,,[],,

Timothy Snyder (Goodreads Author),Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,,English,,"Americans call the Second World War “The Good War.” But before it even began, America’s wartime ally Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens—and kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war’s end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.From BooklistIf there is an explanation for the political killing perpetrated in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, historian Snyder roots it in agriculture. Stalin wanted to collectivize farmers; Hitler wanted to eliminate them so Germans could colonize the land. The dictators wielded frightening power to advance such fantasies toward reality, and the despots toted up about 14 million corpses between them, so stupefying a figure that Snyder sets himself three goals here: to break down the number into the various actions of murder that comprise it, from liquidation of the kulaks to the final solution; to restore humanity to the victims via surviving testimony to their fates; and to deny Hitler and Stalin any historical justification for their policies, which at the time had legions of supporters and have some even today. Such scope may render Snyder’s project too imposing to casual readers, but it would engage those exposed to the period’s chronology and major interpretive issues, such as the extent to which the Nazi and Soviet systems may be compared.

Timothy Zahn (Goodreads Author),Outbound Flight,,English,,"It began as the ultimate voyage of discovery–only to become the stuff of lost Republic legend . . . and a dark chapter in Jedi history. Now, at last, acclaimed author Timothy Zahn returns to tell the whole extraordinary story of the remarkable–and doomed–Outbound Flight Project.The Clone Wars have yet to erupt when Jedi Master Jorus C’baoth petitions the Senate for support of a singularly ambitious undertaking. Six Jedi Masters, twelve Jedi Knights, and fifty thousand men, women, and children will embark–aboard a gargantuan vessel, equipped for years of travel–on a mission to contact intelligent life and colonize undiscovered worlds beyond the known galaxy. The government bureaucracy threatens to scuttle the expedition before it can even start–until Master C’baoth foils a murderous conspiracy plot, winning him the political capital he needs to set in motion the dream of Outbound Flight.Or so it would seem. For unknown to the famed Jedi Master, the successful launch of the mission is secretly being orchestrated by an unlikely ally: the evil Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, who has his own reasons for wanting Outbound Flight to move forward . . . and, ultimately, to fail. Yet Darth Sidious is not the mission’s most dangerous challenge. Once underway, the starship crosses paths at the edge of Unknown Space with the forces of the alien Chiss Ascendancy and the brilliant mastermind best known as “Thrawn.” Even Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, aboard Outbound Flight with his young Padawan student, Anakin Skywalker, cannot help avert disaster. Thus what begins as a peaceful Jedi mission is violently transformed into an all-out war for survival against staggering odds–and the most diabolical of adversaries.Timothy Zahn’s unique mix of espionage, political gamesmanship, and deadly interstellar combat breathes electrifying life into a Star Wars legend.From the Hardcover edition.",Star Wars Legends,,10/30/06,January 30th 2007,"['Sheev Palpatine', 'Thrawn', ""Jorus C'boath"", 'Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'Anakin Skywalker', 'Kinman Doriana']",Paperback,"['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'War', 'Novels']",,9780345456847,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1405546347l/192523.jpg,3.93,[],170.0,2.0,,192523.Outbound_Flight,,,,,94.0,11606.0,480,,Del Rey,"['3538', '4507', '2902', '570', '89']",,,[],,
Timothy Zahn (Goodreads Author),Allegiance,,English,,"Never before has the incendiary mix of action, politics, and intrigue that has become Timothy Zahn’s trademark, been more evident that in this new Star Wars epic. On the heels of the stunning events chronicled in Star Wars: A New Hope, the newly minted heroes of the Rebellion–fledgling Jedi Luke Skywalker, smuggler turned reluctant freedom-fighter Han Solo, and Princess Leia Organa, a bold leader with a world to avenge–must face the harsh realities of the cataclysmic conflict into which they have so bravely plunged. From this point forward, legends will grow, treachery will abound, and lives will be irrevocably altered, in the long, hard fight to counter the fist of tyranny and restore hope to a galaxy too long in darkness.  The destruction of the Death Star by the Rebel Alliance was a decisive blow against the Empire, but Palpatine and his monstrous enforcer, Darth Vader, are no less of a threat. The brutal extermination of Alderaan not only demonstrated the magnitude of their murderous power, but served as a chilling testament to their resolve to crush the Rebel uprising. Standing against them, Skywalker, Solo, and the Princess remain uncertain opponents. Luke is gifted and brave, but unschooled in the power he possesses. Han has doubts about waging someone else’s war–and his contentiousness is one more burden for Leia to bear as she struggles to help keep the Rebellion alive. The three have been sent to mediate a dispute between Rebel Alliance factions in Shelsha Sector–agitating matters by forcing Han to deal not only with pirates, but with his more dreaded enemy, politics. At the same time, Mara Jade–all of eighteen and years away from her fateful meeting with Luke–is serving her evil master, Palpatine, well in her role as the Emperor’s Hand: tracking suspected treachery in the Empire to what may be high places–while trying to stay out of Darth Vader’s way.But the Rebels will prove to be only one of the Empire’s concerns. For Imperial Stormtrooper Daric LaRone, his faith in the Empire shaken by the wanton destruction of Alderaan, will commit a sudden and violent act of defiance, and take four other enforcers with him, in a desperate bid to elude their masters’ wrath.Each of these fateful actions, whether sanctioned, secret, or scandalous, will expose brutality and corruption, spur upheavals destined to shake the Empire to its core, and shape momentous events yet to come.",Star Wars Legends,,,January 30th 2007,"['Luke Skywalker', 'Mara Jade', 'Daric LaRone', 'Kendal Ozzel', 'Leia Organa', 'Han Solo']",Hardcover,"['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Space Opera', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Space']",,9780345477385,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1168588167l/35414._SY475_.jpg,3.99,[],160.0,2.0,,35414.Allegiance,,,,,95.0,7905.0,324,,Del Rey,"['2607', '3048', '1873', '319', '58']",,,[],,

Timothy Zahn (Goodreads Author),Scoundrels,,English,,"To make his biggest score, Han’s ready to take even bigger risks.But even he can’t do this job solo. Han Solo should be basking in his moment of glory. After all, the cocky smuggler and captain of the Millennium Falcon just played a key role in the daring raid that destroyed the Death Star and landed the first serious blow to the Empire in its war against the Rebel Alliance. But after losing the reward his heroics earned him, Han’s got nothing to celebrate. Especially since he’s deep in debt to the ruthless crime lord Jabba the Hutt. There’s a bounty on Han’s head--and if he can’t cough up the credits, he’ll surely pay with his hide. The only thing that can save him is a king’s ransom. Or maybe a gangster’s fortune? That’s what a mysterious stranger is offering in exchange for Han’s less-than-legal help with a riskier-than-usual caper. The payoff will be more than enough for Han to settle up with Jabba--and ensure he never has to haggle with the Hutts again. All he has to do is infiltrate the ultra-fortified stronghold of a Black Sun crime syndicate underboss and crack the galaxy’s most notoriously impregnable safe. It sounds like a job for miracle workers...or madmen. So Han assembles a gallery of rogues who are a little of both--including his indispensable sidekick Chewbacca and the cunning Lando Calrissian. If anyone can dodge, deceive, and defeat heavily armed thugs, killer droids, and Imperial agents alike--and pull off the heist of the century--it’s Solo’s scoundrels.

Timothy Zahn (Goodreads Author),Thrawn,,English,,"One of the most cunning and ruthless warriors in the history of the Galactic Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn is also one of the most captivating characters in the Star Wars universe, from his introduction in bestselling author Timothy Zahn’s classic Heir to the Empire through his continuing adventures in Dark Force Rising, The Last Command, and beyond. But Thrawn’s origins and the story of his rise in the Imperial ranks have remained mysterious. Now, in Star Wars: Thrawn, Timothy Zahn chronicles the fateful events that launched the blue-skinned, red-eyed master of military strategy and lethal warfare into the highest realms of power—and infamy.After Thrawn is rescued from exile by Imperial soldiers, his deadly ingenuity and keen tactical abilities swiftly capture the attention of Emperor Palpatine. And just as quickly, Thrawn proves to be as indispensable to the Empire as he is ambitious; as devoted as its most loyal servant, Darth Vader; and a brilliant warrior never to be underestimated. On missions to rout smugglers, snare spies, and defeat pirates, he triumphs time and again—even as his renegade methods infuriate superiors while inspiring ever greater admiration from the Empire. As one promotion follows another in his rapid ascension to greater power, he schools his trusted aide, Ensign Eli Vanto, in the arts of combat and leadership, and the secrets of claiming victory. But even though Thrawn dominates the battlefield, he has much to learn in the arena of politics, where ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce holds the power to be a potent ally or a brutal enemy.All these lessons will be put to the ultimate test when Thrawn rises to admiral and must pit all the knowledge, instincts, and battle forces at his command against an insurgent uprising that threatens not only innocent lives but also the Empire’s grip on the galaxy—and his own carefully laid plans for future ascendancy.",Star Wars: Thrawn #1,,,April 6th 2017,"['Sheev Palpatine', 'Thrawn', 'Anakin Skywalker', 'Wullf Yularen', 'Maketh Tua', 'Arihnda Pryce', 'Mosh Barris', 'Deenlark', 'Voss Parck', 'Eli Vanto']",Hardcover,"['Star Wars', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Space Opera', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Adventure', 'Media Tie In']",,9781780894843,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1468787895l/31140332._SY475_.jpg,4.28,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science Fiction (2017)'],97.0,1.0,,31140332-thrawn,,,,,97.0,26601.0,427,,Random House,"['12275', '10204', '3414', '581', '127']",,,[],,

Cette ombre qui plane, c’est encore elle. Et puis cela disparaît. Plus rien sur le sol. L’ombre complice est partie en fumée, éteinte. Épouvantée, elle cherche un regard alentour. Rien, personne. Ils passent, des groupes, des individus, sans une seule œillade de son côté. Personne ne s’arrête. Elle, les regarde, et à leurs voix fortes, à leurs pas décidés, affairés, elle comprend enfin qu’elle est devenue INVISIBLE.""  Si le roman permet l’évasion par personnage interposé, il questionne aussi le réel plus vivement qu’un essai ou un discours.  Entre artifices et désirs profonds, Tina Noiret nous fait partager la vie d’une femme. Alexina, fille de son temps et influencée par les féminismes, va poser les questions existentielles fondamentales que se pose tout être et tout lecteur. Mère surmenée, son histoire est le grain de sable dans la mécanique si bien huilée des oppressions qui frappent celles qui veulent réaliser la quadrature du cercle – amour, travail, famille – et que la société exclut.

Elle les regarde, et à leurs voix fortes, à leurs pas décidés, affairés, elle comprend enfin qu’elle est devenue INVISIBLE. C’est un choc, un réveil violent. Elle voit mais ne peut être vue.

Cette relation se développe comme une tragédie antique qui fait resurgir les dieux et les mythes de l’Olympe derrière les personnages.

Bruxelles, Strasbourg, Luxembourg défilent sur fond de trahison, amoureuse, politique et de soi-même.

Ce soir-là, la mer était brune, marron, et presque noire aux confins. Elle charriait déjà sur les brise-lames une odeur d'algues, de parchemin et de pourriture. Dans cette écume, j'ai jeté pêle-mêle un bon millier de pages éparses, une centaine de nouvelles, deux ou trois romans inachevés, un essai et des millions de rimes sans suite, sans vers. Une boue de mots et de souvenirs qui depuis des lustres ne pesaient presque plus rien, à peine l'âme des morts dans les sarcophages. C'était en avril 2000, je m'en souviens et la mer ce soir-là, semble-t-il, crachait un vent plus sauvage, comme si elle brassait les souvenirs des écrivains déchus de toute la planète. Odeur de voix flétries, d'algues pourries, de cadavres et de renaissances. Sac et ressac d’échos, de mots perdus, amers, errants et délétères, abandonnés aux tourments de la matière. Un âpre goût de sel, de souvenirs séquestrés, éparpillés au vent, à l'océan, à la perte immonde et infinie. De retour chez moi, ce soir-là, les bras légers et l'esprit dégagé, sur le pas de ma porte était posé un petit tas de feuilles numérotées, agrafées.

Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay,How Can I Talk If My Lips Don't Move: Inside My Autistic Mind,,English,,"An astounding new work by the author of The Mind Tree that offers a rare insight into the autistic mind and how it thinks, sees, and reacts to the world. When he was three years old, Tito was diagnosed as severely autistic, but his remarkable mother, Soma, determined that he would overcome the problem by teaching him to read and write. The result was that between the ages of eight and eleven he wrote stories and poems of exquisite beauty, which Dr. Oliver Sacks called amazing and shocking. Their eloquence gave lie to all our assumptions about autism.Here Tito goes even further and writes of how the autistic mind works, how it views the outside world and the normal people he deals with daily, how he tells his stories to the mirror and hears stories back, how sounds become colors, how beauty fills his mind and heart. With this work, Tito whom Portia Iversen, co-founder of Cure Autism Now, has described as a window into autism such as the world has never seen gives the world a beacon of hope. For if he can do it, why can't others?Brave, bold, and deeply felt, this book shows that much we might have believed about autism can be wrong.

ToHemenway,Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-scale Permaculture,,English,,"Permaculture is a verbal marriage of ""permanent"" and ""agriculture."" Australian Bill Mollison pioneered its development. Key features include:- use of compatible perennials;- non-invasive planting techniques;- emphasis on biodiversity;- specifically adaptable to local climate, landscape, and soil conditions;- highly productive output of edibles.Now, picture your backyard as one incredibly lush garden, filled with edible flowers, bursting with fruit and berries, and carpeted with scented herbs and tangy salad greens. The visual impact is of Monet's palette, a wash of color, texture, and hue. But this is no still life. The flowers nurture endangered pollinators. Bright-featured songbirds feed on abundant berries and gather twigs for their nests.The plants themselves are grouped in natural communities, where each species plays a role in building soil, deterring pests, storing nutrients, and luring beneficial insects. And finally, you—good ol' homo sapiens—are an integral part of the scene. Your garden tools are resting against a nearby tree, and have a slight patina of rust, because this garden requires so little maintenance. You recline into a hammock to admire your work. You have created a garden paradise.This is no dream, but rather an ecological garden, which takes the principles of permaculture and applies them on a home-scale. There is nothing technical, intrusive, secretive, or expensive about this form of gardening.

Thrust back into action after being sidelined, Keyes is saddled with a top secret mission by ONI. One that will take him deep behind enemy lines, to a corner of the universe where nothing is as it seems.Out beyond the Outer Colonies lies the planet Hesiod, a gas giant surrounded by a vast asteroid belt.

Tobias Wolff,Old School,,,Authors,"It's 1960, in America, at a prestigious boys' public school, a place of privilege that places great emphasis on its democratic ideals. A teenage boy in his final year, on a scholarship, has learned to fit in with his adoptive tribe while concealing as much as possible about himself and his background. Class is ever present, but the only acknowledged snobbery is a literary snobbery. These boys' heroes are writers - Fitzgerald, Cummings, Kerouac. They want to be writers themselves, and the school has a tradition whereby once a term big names from the literary world are invited to visit. A contest takes place with the boys admitting a piece of writing and the winner having a private audience with the visitor. When it is announced that Hemingway will be the next to come to the school, competition among the boys is intense, and the morals the school and the boys hold dear - honour, loyalty and friendship - are tested. No one writes more astutely than Wolff about the process by which character is formed, and here he illuminates the irresistible strength, even the violence, of the self-creative urge. This is a novel that, in its power and its beauty, in its precision and its humanity, is at once contemporary and timeless.",,,,2005.0,,,,0747574650,9780747574651,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qNrFwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.82,,,,,,,,,,,,195.0,,,,7763.0,,,,

Separated by divorce from his father and brother, Toby and his mother are constantly on the move, yet they develop an extraordinarily close, almost telepathic relationship. As Toby fights for identity and self-respect against the unrelenting hostility of a new stepfather, his experiences are at once poignant and comical, and Wolff does a masterful job of re-creating the frustrations and cruelties of adolescence.

In the years since, he’s written a third collection, The Night in Question, as well as a pair of genre-defining memoirs (This Boy’s Life and In Pharaoh’s Army), the novella The Barracks Thief, and, most recently, a novel, Old School.Now he returns with fresh revelations—about biding one’s time, or experiencing first love, or burying one’s mother—that come to a variety of characters in circumstances at once everyday and extraordinary: a retired Marine enrolled in college while her son trains for Iraq, a lawyer taking a difficult deposition, an American in Rome indulging the Gypsy who’s picked his pocket.

What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how ""really, really big"" God is, and how much God loves us.

To have no memory of ever being alone.”Twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike are enjoying a relatively comfortable life in Lagos in 1996. Then their mother loses her job due to political strife, and the family, facing poverty, becomes drawn into the New Church, an institution led by a charismatic pastor who is not shy about worshipping earthly wealth. Soon Bibike and Ariyike’s father wagers the family home on a “sure bet” that evaporates like smoke. As their parents’ marriage collapses in the aftermath of this gamble, the twin sisters and their two younger siblings, Andrew and Peter, are thrust into the reluctant care of their traditional Yoruba grandmother. Inseparable while they had their parents to care for them, the twins’ paths diverge once the household shatters. Each girl is left to locate, guard, and hone her own fragile source of power. Written with astonishing intimacy and wry attention to the fickleness of fate, Tola Rotimi Abraham’s Black Sunday takes us into the chaotic heart of family life, tracing a line from the euphoria of kinship to the devastation of estrangement.

Tom Baker,Who on Earth is Tom Baker?,,English,,"One of the great British television phenomena of the 60's and 70's, known to all who are now entering or firmly placed in mid-life, was the advent of Doctor Who. This original and most British of television series chronicled the travels and tribulations of the famous Doctor Who and his merry band of followers. Tom Baker, though not the first but probably the most unforgettable of the actors who took on this role, has published an autobiography that not only lets us explore the man made famous but also the man himself. Tom inhabited the world of television production agencies, the BBC with its cast of thousands, and the drinking haunts of Soho with the likes of Jeffery Bernard, Anthony Hopkins and actors for whom feast and famine were a daily way of life.  Tom, with his expressive face and kind eyes was born in Liverpool to a raucous and lively Irish family where love and a good respect for the teachings of the Catholic Church were able to prepare him for an interesting and fulfilling life. In fact, Tom's early experiences with the church involved a trial at a monastery for an unsuccessful preparation as a priest and an insight into the daily workings of these institutions. A slow starting but rapidly improving acting career was followed by time spent pulling pints and on London construction sites before the big break. Then came with the casting agent and the meeting that allowed for instant world-wide recognition for the famous Doctor Who that still exists today.  The style of the story is very much that of a black comedy with a marriage, children and a certain fixation with a lawnmower and the mowing of the grass around his own gravestone, making for an enjoyable read. He is now happily married and living in a rural utopia outside of London, millions of miles and light years away from the hectic and all- consuming career of both straight acting and in the television role that has made him famous in more that 70 countries. --Brian Reinker",,,11/06/97,October 5th 1998,"['Laurence Olivier', 'Jeffrey Bernard', 'Tom Baker']",Paperback,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Doctor Who', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Humor', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature']",,9780006388548,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1180292188l/1020842.jpg,4.08,[],91.0,1.0,,1020842.Who_on_Earth_is_Tom_Baker_,,,,,94.0,700.0,262,,HarperCollins,"['267', '273', '119', '33', '8']",,,[],,

As one of the first bona fide superstars in the World Wrestling Federation, Billington's career parallels the development of the WWF, from the early days to the decade following the first Wrestlemaina event at Madison Square Gardens in 1985. He worked with every major promoter, and wrestled with some of the biggest names in the sport. His story is a candid expose of the highs and lows of a cultural phenomenon that is still growing today. Now confined to a wheelchair as a result of serious damage to his back and legs, his years of steroid use have also damages Billington's heart and personal life.

Tom Brokaw,The Greatest Generation,,English,,"""In the spring of 1984, I went to the northwest of France, to Normandy, to prepare an NBC documentary on the fortieth anniversary of D-Day, the massive and daring Allied invasion of Europe that marked the beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. There, I underwent a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary, men in their sixties and seventies, and listened to their stories, I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done. Ten years later, I returned to Normandy for the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion, and by then I had come to understand what this generation of Americans meant to history. It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced.""        In this superb book, Tom Brokaw goes out into America, to tell through the stories of individual men and women the story of a generation, America's citizen heroes and heroines who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. This generation was united not only by a common purpose, but also by common values--duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country, and, above all, responsibility for oneself. In this book, you will meet people whose everyday lives reveal how a generation persevered through war, and were trained by it, and then went on to create interesting and useful lives and the America we have today.""At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation, the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated, anywhere. They gave the world new science, literature, art, industry, and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives, they remain, for the most part, exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell, stories that in many cases they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone else was doing it too. ""This book, I hope, will in some small way pay tribute to those men and women who have given us the lives we have today--an American family portrait album of the greatest generation.""                In this book you'll meet people like Charles Van Gorder, who set up during D-Day a MASH-like medical facility in the middle of the fighting, and then came home to create a clinic and hospital in his hometown. You'll hear George Bush talk about how, as a Navy Air Corps combat pilot, one of his assignments was to read the mail of the enlisted men under him, to be sure no sensitive military information would be compromised. And so, Bush says, ""I learned about life."" You'll meet Trudy Elion, winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine, one of the many women in this book who found fulfilling careers in the changed society as a result of the war. You'll meet Martha Putney, one of the first black women to serve in the newly formed WACs. And you'll meet the members of the Romeo Club (Retired Old Men Eating Out), friends for life.         Through these and other stories in The Greatest Generation, you'll relive with ordinary men and women, military heroes, famous people of great achievement, and community leaders how these extraordinary times forged the values and provided the training that made a people and a nation great.From the Hardcover edition.",,,12/01/98,May 1st 2001,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'American History', 'War', 'Historical', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History', 'Memoir']",,9780812975291,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924595l/32987.jpg,4.01,[],96.0,1.0,,32987.The_Greatest_Generation,,,,,94.0,16539.0,464,,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['5776', '6355', '3438', '760', '210']",,,[],,

Tom Clancy,Debt of Honor,,,Fiction,"Every novel by Tom Clancy has been ""a jaw-tightener and a nail-biter of the first order, "" as the San Diego Union described Without Remorse. But Debt of Honor surpasses them all, with Jack Ryan facing his greatest challenge - against a peril that may become all too real. In retrospect, it would seem an odd way to start a war. . . . The end of history. The new world order. Fine phrases, but as Jack Ryan is about to discover, history isn't dead yet - and only the nature of the threat is new. On the Pacific island of Saipan, a wealthy Japanese businessman regards his new-bought land with satisfaction. In the Indian Ocean off Sri Lanka, a foreign navy begins a series of highly unusual exercises. At the headquarters of America's major stock-clearing corporation, an engineer brings a customized computer program on-line for the first time, and smiles at his own private joke. Three seemingly unrelated incidents, but all just the first links in a chain of events that will stun the world. Called out of retirement to serve as the new President's National Security Advisor, Jack Ryan quickly realizes that the problems of peace are fully as complex as those of war. Enemies have become friends, friends enemies, and even the form of conflict has changed. What he cannot realize, however, is just how close the next conflict is. And when one of those new enemies readies a strike not only at America's territory, but at the heart of her economy, it is Ryan, with the help of CIA officers John Clark and Domingo Chavez, who must prepare an untested President to meet the challenge, if Ryan can only figure out how. For there is a debt of honor to be paid - and the price will be terrifyingly high. . .",,,,1995.0,,,,0425147584,9780425147580,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AQ5ZlsUaLRMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.05,,,,,,,,,,,,990.0,,,,37878.0,,,,

Tom Clancy,Red Rabbit,,English,,"Long before he was President or head of the CIA, before he fought terrorist attacks on the Super Bowl or the White House, even before a submarine named Red October made its perilous way across the Atlantic, Jack Ryan was an historian, teacher, and recent ex-Marine temporarily living in England while researching a book. A series of deadly encounters with an IRA splinter group had brought him to the attention of the CIA's Deputy Director, Vice Admiral James Greer—as well as his counterpart with the British SIS, Sir Basil Charleston—and when Greer asked him if he wanted to come aboard as a freelance analyst, Jack was quick to accept. The opportunity was irresistible, and he was sure he could fit it in with the rest of his work.And then Jack forgot all about the rest of his work, because one of his first assignments was to help debrief a high-level Soviet defector, and the defector told an amazing tale: Top Soviet officials, including Yuri Andropov, were planning to assassinate the Pope, John Paul II.Could it be true? As the days and weeks go by, Ryan must battle, first to try to confirm the plot, and then to prevent it, but this is a brave new world, and nothing he has done up to now has prepared him for the lethal game of cat-and-mouse that is the Soviet Union versus the United States. In the end, it will be not just the Pope's life but the stability of the Western world that is at stake. . . and it may already be too late for a novice CIA analyst to do anything about it.",Jack Ryan #2,,,August 26th 2002,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Espionage', 'Mystery', 'Action', 'Adventure', 'Military Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Spy Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller']",,9780399148705,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546283429l/19707.jpg,3.7,[],433.0,6.0,,19707.Red_Rabbit,,,,,88.0,28247.0,640,,G.P.

Tom Clancy,The Bear and the Dragon,,English,,"
  Time and again, Tom Clancy's novels have been praised not only for their big-scale drama and propulsive narrative drive but for their cutting-edge prescience in predicting future events.
  
In The Bear and the Dragon, the future is very near at hand indeed.Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; there's a revolution in Liberia; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR--the former KGB--with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?Ryan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail...the consequences will be unspeakable.Blending the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, razor-sharp suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters, this is Clancy at his best--and there is none better.",John Clark #3,,08/21/00,August 1st 2001,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Espionage', 'Military Fiction', 'Action', 'Suspense', 'Adventure', 'War', 'Mystery', 'Spy Thriller']",,9780425180969,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348787629l/19687.jpg,3.84,[],242.0,5.0,,19687.The_Bear_and_the_Dragon,,,,,91.0,26584.0,1137,,Berkley Books,"['7818', '9893', '6427', '1763', '683']",,,[],,

Shunned by their erstwhile Soviet sponsors, increasingly isolated by the realignment of the Mideast, these terrorists have one more desperate card to play, requiring a degree of ruthlessness never before seen. With one terrible act, the world is plunged into an instant nuclear crisis -- and the floundering President is plunged into the ultimate nightmare. Forces collide. Shots are exchanged.

Rainbow Six, however, goes beyond anything he has done before.At its heart is John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL of Without Remorse, well known from several of Clancy's novels as a master of secret operational missions. Whether hunting warlords in Japan, druglords in Colombia, or nuclear terrorists in the United States, Clark is efficient and deadly, but even he has ghosts in his past, demons that must be exorcised. And nothing is more demonic than the peril he must face in Rainbow Six.Newly named the head of an international task force dedicated to combating terrorism, Clark is looking forward to getting his teeth into a new mission, but the opportunities start coming thicker and faster than anyone could have expected: an incident at a Swiss bank, the kidnapping of an international trader in Germany, a terrible raid on an amusement park in Spain.Each episode seems separate, discrete, yet the timing disturbs Clark. Is there a connection? Is he being tested? With the help of his close associates, executive officer Alistair Stanley and strike team leaders Domingo Chavez and Peter Covington, Clark tries to figure out where all this activity is heading, but there is no way to predict the real threat: a group of terrorists like none the world has ever encountered, a band of men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean the end of life on this earth as we know it.",John Clark #2,,08/03/98,September 1st 1999,"['John Clark', 'Domingo Chavez']",Mass Market Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Military Fiction', 'Action', 'Espionage', 'Adventure', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'War']",,9780425170342,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179305l/5720.jpg,4.09,[],1589.0,19.0,,5720.Rainbow_Six,,,,,94.0,48746.0,912,,Berkley Books,"['19461', '17617', '8898', '2083', '687']",,,[],,

Dede Davis had worried, fussed, and obsessed for the last time: Her heart stopped beating in a fit of anxiety. In the wake of his mother's death, Tom Davis knew one thing: Helplessly self-absorbed and severely obsessive compulsive, Dede led a tormented life. She spent years bouncing around mental health facilities, nursing homes, and assisted-living facilities, but what really caused her death?A Legacy of Madness portrays Tom Davis's captivating discoveries of mental illness throughout generations of his family. Investigating his mother's history led to that of Davis's grandfather, a top administrator at one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the country; his great-grandfather who died of self-inflicted gas asphyxiation during the Depression; and his great-great grandmother who, with her eldest son, completed suicide one tragic day. Ultimately, four generations of family members showed clear signs of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and alcoholism—often mistreated illnesses that test one's ability to cope.Through this intimate memoir, we join Davis on a personal odyssey to ensure that he and his siblings, the fifth generation,—recover their family legacy by not only surviving their own mental health disorders but by getting the help they need to lead healthy, balanced lives.

Tom Diaz,The Last Gun: How Changes in the Gun Industry Are Killing Americans and What It Will Take to Stop It,,English,,"FROM THE INFLUENTIAL GUN CONTROL ADVOCATE AND AUTHOR, A STARTLING NEW ANALYSIS OF GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE—IN A BOOK THAT SHOWS THE PATH TO A SAFER FUTURE""In his eminently readable style, mixing science and anecdote, Diaz shows how our leaders have created gun policies that are good for the gun industry but horrific for our nation. He also describes solutions worthy of the name. What a timely book!"" —DAVID HEMENWAY, PROFESSOR OF HEALTH POLICY, HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTHNewtown, Connecticut. Aurora, Colorado. Both have entered our collective memory as sites of unimaginable heartbreak and mass slaughter, perpetrated by lone gunmen. Meanwhile, cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. are dealing with the painful, everyday reality of record rates of gun-related deaths. By any account, gun violence in the United States has reached epidemic proportions: we are by far the most armed nation on earth, and we have the deaths to show for it. But how did we get here, and where do we go next?In The Last Gun, Tom Diaz lays out a lucid, incisive account of why we are facing this epidemic—and what we can do to stop it. A widely respected activist and policy analyst—as well as a former gun enthusiast and ex-member of the National Rifle Association—Diaz presents a chilling, up-to-date survey of the changed landscape of gun manufacturing and marketing. The Last Gun explores how the gun industry has shifted dramatically in the last decade and how the nature of gun violence has changed in step with industry trends, including the disturbing rise in the military-grade gun models that have brought us to a numbing new level of violence. But Diaz also argues that the once formidable gun lobby has become a “paper tiger,” marshaling a range of stunning evidence and case studies to eloquently make the case that now is the time for a renewed political effort to attack gun violence at its source—the guns themselves. Because, despite all the rhetoric, guns do kill people.In the aftermath of Newtown, a challenging national conversation lies ahead. The Last Gun is an indispensable guide to this debate, and essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how we can finally rid America’s streets, schools, and homes of gun violence and prevent future Newtowns.Tom Diaz is a writer, lawyer, and public speaker on the gun industry and gun control. Formerly senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center, he has been featured on MSNBC, NPR, and other national media. His books include Making a Killing (The New Press).

Tom Downey,The Last Men Out: Life on the Edge at Rescue 2 Firehouse,,English,,"The inside story of one of Americaâ€™s most elite firehouses and the extraordinary brotherhood of men who face extreme danger every dayFirefighting is a world of absolutes: evil is a red devil that wants destruction and death, good is a charged hose line, full of water to fight the flames. The best and boldest firefighters in the country, the men of Rescue 2 are hand-picked to fight not just the biggest blazes but any other emergency New York can throw at them. The sheer adrenaline of the job is perfectly captured in the dramatic story of their firehouse, a model for others nationwide--dubbed ""the cuisinart"" because it slices up new recruits.The story begins in the late 1990s as Phil Ruvolo takes command just a few years after the departure of Captain Ray Downey, a legendary FDNY leader. Ruvolo inherits a stubborn group of vets, many still loyal to Downey. He also steps into a firehouse mourning the recent loss of a brother-- Rescue 2's first fire fatality since the 1950s.Tom Downey takes us into the firemanâ€™s world: the smell of their coats after a good fire, the hardened eyes of a veteran after a fellow firemanâ€™s death, the humor and camaraderie. His firemen are not cardboard heroes; theyâ€™re a group of gritty, larger-than-life personalities brought together by dedication and a mission to save lives.

In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas ""32"" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town.More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable.

Tom Horton,An Island Out of Time: A Memoir of Smith Island in the Chesapeake,,English,,"Smith Island is a marshy archipelago in mid-Chesapeake Bay, nine miles from the mainland, home to 150 watermen and their families. This book is a portrait of a people who have remained intimately connected to the place in which they live, far past the time when ""place"" and ""nature"" any longer have immediate consequence to most of our lives. Tom Horton lived for nearly three years on Smith Island, recording through observation and interviews the traditions of oystering, crab catching, churchgoing, hunting and poaching, and the social rituals of these fiercely independent men and women. His beautifully elegiac story is about community and isolation, harvest and exploitation, and the risks and charms of being different from the surrounding world. Like Ian Frazier's The Great Plains, this is a book that grows from a vast and unique geography. The grassy shallows and the hidden bottoms of Smith Island, and of the Chesapeake, once supported a variety of waterfowl and marine life that astonished the early explorers. The decline of these natural wonders and the attempt to restore the health of Chesapeake Bay is one part of the story; the other is an effort to give voice to a distinctive people whose three centuries of working and being constitute an eloquent statement of humans in nature.",,,06/01/96,May 27th 1997,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Natural History', 'Memoir', 'Travel']",,9780679781059,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1223676036l/296892.jpg,3.92,[],98.0,1.0,,296892.An_Island_Out_of_Time,,,,,95.0,133.0,336,,Vintage,"['37', '57', '32', '6', '1']",,,[],,

"Tom Mangold, John Penycate",The Tunnels of Cu Chi: A Harrowing Account of America's Tunnel Rats in the Underground Battlefields of Vietnam,,English,,"At the height of the Vietnam conflict, a complex system of secret underground tunnels sprawled from Cu Chi Province to the edge of Saigon. In these burrows, the Viet Cong cached their weapons, tended their wounded, and prepared to strike. They had only one enemy: U.S. soldiers small and wiry enough to maneuver through the guerrillas’ narrow domain. The brave souls who descended into these hellholes were known as “tunnel rats.” Armed with only pistols and K-bar knives, these men inched their way through the steamy darkness where any number of horrors could be awaiting them–bullets, booby traps, a tossed grenade. Using firsthand accounts from men and women on both sides who fought and killed in these underground battles, authors Tom Mangold and John Penycate provide a gripping inside look at this fearsome combat. The Tunnels of Cu Chi is a war classic of unbearable tension and unforgettable heroes.",,,11/06/85,November 29th 2005,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Military History', 'Asia', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Biography', 'World History']",,9780891418696,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320524295l/156156.jpg,4.03,[],85.0,1.0,,156156.The_Tunnels_of_Cu_Chi,,,,,96.0,1762.0,320,,Presidio Press,"['601', '710', '373', '61', '17']",,,[],,

Tom McCarthy,Satin Island,,English,,"From the author of Remainder (the major feature-film adaption of which will be released in 2015) and C (short-listed for the Booker Prize), and winner of the Windham Campbell Prize, a novel that promises to give us the first and last word on the world--modern, postmodern, whatever world you think you are living in.When we first meet U., our narrator, he is waiting out a delay in the Turin airport. Clicking through corridors of trivia on his laptop he stumbles on information about the Shroud of Turin--and is struck by the degree to which our access to the truth is always mediated by a set of veils or screens, with any world built on those truths inherently unstable. A ""corporate ethnographer,"" U. is tasked with writing the ""Great Report,"" an ell-encompassing document that would sum up our era. Yet at every turn, he feels himself overwhelmed by the ubiquity of data, lost in buffer zones, wandering through crowds of apparitions. Madison, the woman he is seeing, is increasingly elusive, much like the particulars in the case of the recent parachutist's death with which U. is obsessed. Add to that his longstanding obsession with South Pacific cargo cults and his developing, inexplicable interest in oil spills. As he begins to wonder if the Great Report might remain a shapeless, oozing plasma, his senses are startled awake by a dream of an apocalyptic cityscape. In Satin Island, Tom McCarthy captures--as only he can-- the way we experience our world, our efforts to find meaning (or just to stay awake) and discern the narratives we think of as our lives.",,,,February 17th 2015,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', '21st Century', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Unfinished']",,9780307593955,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409602963l/22543699.jpg,3.23,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2015)', 'Goldsmiths Prize Nominee (2015)']",80.0,1.0,,22543699-satin-island,,,,,75.0,4924.0,192,,Knopf,"['654', '1442', '1594', '848', '386']",,,[],,

Tom Morris,Philosophy For Dummies,,,Philosophy,"Philosophy at its best is an activity more than a body of knowledge. In an ancient sense, done right, it is a healing art. It’s intellectual self-defense. It’s a form of therapy. But it’s also much more. Philosophy is map-making for the soul, cartography for the human journey. It’s an important navigational tool for life that too many modern people try to do without. Philosophy For Dummies is for anyone who has ever entertained a question about life and this world. In a conversational tone, the book's author – a modern-day scholar and lecturer – brings the greatest wisdom of the past into the challenges that we face now. This refreshingly different guide explains philosophical fundamentals and explores some of the strangest and deepest questions ever posed to human beings, such as How do we know anything? What does the word good mean? Are we ever really free? Do human beings have souls? Is there life after death? Is there a God? Is happiness really possible in our world? This book is chock full of all those questions you may have long wanted to think about and talk with someone about, but have never had the time or opportunity to tackle head on. Philosophy For Dummies invites you to discuss the issues you find in the guide, share perspectives, and compare thoughts and feelings with someone you respect. You'll find lots of material to mull over with your friends or spouse, including thoughts on When to doubt, and when to doubt our doubts The universal demand for evidence and proof The four dimensions of human experience Arguments for materialism Fear of the process of dying Prayers and small miracles Moral justification for allowing evil The ancient philosopher Socrates (fifth century, B.C.) thought that, when it comes to the Ultimate Questions, we all start off as dummies.

It's the kind of place where parents are involved in their children's lives, where no opportunity for enrichment goes unexplored. Ruth Ramsey is the human sexuality teacher at the local high school. She believes that ""pleasure is good, shame is bad, and knowledge is power."" Ruth's younger daughter's soccer coach is Tim Mason, a former stoner and rocker whose response to hitting rock bottom was to reach out and be saved. Tim belongs to The Tabernacle, an evangelical Christian church that doesn't approve of Ruth's style of teaching. And Ruth in turn doesn't applaud The Tabernacle's mission to take its message outside its doors. Adversaries in a small-town culture war, Ruth and Tim instinctively mistrust each other. But when a controversy on the soccer field pushes the two of them to actually talk to each other, they are forced to take each other at something other than face value. The Abstinence Teacher exposes the powerful emotions that run beneath the surface of modern American family life and explores the complex spiritual and sexual lives of ordinary people. Elegantly written, it is characterized by the distinctive mix of satire and compassion that have animated Perrotta's previous novels.",,,10/30/07,October 16th 2007,"['Ruth Ramsey', 'Tim Mason', 'Pastor Dennis']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Religion', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Literature']",,9780307356369,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320459201l/347143.jpg,3.25,[],120.0,2.0,,347143.The_Abstinence_Teacher,,,,,80.0,16508.0,368,,Random House Canada,"['1377', '5269', '6628', '2563', '671']",,,['New Jersey (United States)'],,

Tom Rachman,The Imperfectionists,,English,,"Set against the gorgeous backdrop of Rome, Tom Rachman’s wry, vibrant debut follows the topsy-turvy private lives of the reporters, editors, and executives of an international English language newspaper as they struggle to keep it—and themselves—afloat. Fifty years and many changes have ensued since the paper was founded by an enigmatic millionaire, and now, amid the stained carpeting and dingy office furniture, the staff’s personal dramas seem far more important than the daily headlines. Kathleen, the imperious editor in chief, is smarting from a betrayal in her open marriage; Arthur, the lazy obituary writer, is transformed by a personal tragedy; Abby, the embattled financial officer, discovers that her job cuts and her love life are intertwined in a most unexpected way. Out in the field, a veteran Paris freelancer goes to desperate lengths for his next byline, while the new Cairo stringer is mercilessly manipulated by an outrageous war correspondent with an outsize ego.

"Tom Rath (Goodreads Author), James K. Harter",Wellbeing: The Five Essential Elements,,English,,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Tom Rath (more than 2 million copies sold in the U.S.) and bestselling author Jim Harter, Ph.D., a wide-ranging book (based on a 150-country Gallup study) that will help readers improve their careers, relationships, finances, physical health and community wellbeing.Over the past decade, Gallup has introduced the concepts of strengths-based development and employee engagement to more than 20 million people around the world — largely through the #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller StrengthsFinder 2.0 by Tom Rath and the New York Times bestseller 12: The Elements of Great Managing, which was coauthored by engagement expert Jim Harter. In Wellbeing: The Five Essential Elements, these bestselling authors team up to share the results of a landmark study of wellbeing and its implications for organizations and individuals. Their groundbreaking research reveals how organizations can help employees boost their overall wellbeing — from their satisfaction with their careers to their financial security and level of community involvement. After conducting this extensive study, Rath and Harter discovered that much of what we think will improve our wellbeing is either misguided or just plain wrong. When striving to improve our lives, we’re quick to buy into programs that promise to help us make money, lose weight or strengthen our relationships. While it might be easier to treat these critical areas in our lives as if they are independent, they’re not. Gallup’s comprehensive study of people in more than 150 countries revealed five universal, interconnected elements that shape our lives: Career Wellbeing, Social Wellbeing, Financial Wellbeing, Physical Wellbeing and Community Wellbeing. Wellbeing: The Five Essential Elements provides you with a holistic view of what contributes to your wellbeing over a lifetime. Written in a conversational style, this book is filled with fascinating research and innovative ideas for boosting your wellbeing in each of these five areas. As a complement to the book, you’ll have the opportunity to use Gallup’s online Wellbeing Finder to track and improve your wellbeing. By the time you finish reading this book, you’ll have a better understanding of what makes life worthwhile. This will enable you to enjoy each day and get more out of your life — while boosting the wellbeing of your friends, family members, colleagues and others in your community.",,,,May 4th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Buisness', 'Science']",,9781595620408,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391244948l/8063945.jpg,3.75,[],78.0,1.0,,8063945-wellbeing,,,,,91.0,1424.0,240,,Gallup Press,"['358', '501', '438', '111', '16']",,,[],,

Your mother's not well, his father tells him. She's been imagining things--terrible, terrible things. She's had a psychotic breakdown, and has been committed to a mental hospital.Daniel prepares to rush to Sweden, on the first available flight the next day. Before he can board the plane, his father contacts him again with even more frightening news: his mother has been released from the hospital, and he doesn't know where she is.Then, he hears from his mother:I'm sure your father has spoken to you. Everything that man has told you is a lie. I'm not mad. I don't need a doctor. I need the police. I'm about to board a flight to London.

Tom Robbins,B Is for Beer,,English,," A Children's Book About Beer?   Yes, believe it or not—but B Is for Beer is also a book for adults, and bear in mind that it's the work of maverick bestselling novelist Tom Robbins, inter-nationally known for his ability to both seriously illuminate and comically entertain.   Once upon a time (right about now) there was a planet (how about this one?) whose inhabitants consumed thirty-six billion gallons of beer each year (it's a fact, you can Google it). Among those affected, each in his or her own way, by all the bubbles, burps, and foam, was a smart, wide-eyed, adventurous kindergartner named Gracie; her distracted mommy; her insensitive dad; her non-conformist uncle; and a magical, butt-kicking intruder from a world within our world.   Populated by the aforementioned characters—and as charming as it may be subversive—B Is for Beer involves readers, young and old, in a surprising, far-reaching investigation into the limits of reality, the transformative powers of children, and, of course, the ultimate meaning of a tall, cold brewski.

Tom Robbins,Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates,,English,,"""As clever and witty a novel as anyone has written in a long time . . . Robbins takes readers on a wild, delightful ride. . . . A delight from beginning to end.""--Buffalo NewsSwitters is a contradiction for all seasons: an anarchist who works for the government; a pacifist who carries a gun; a vegetarian who sops up ham gravy; a cyberwhiz who hates computers; a man who, though obsessed with the preservation of innocence, is aching to deflower his high-school-age stepsister (only to become equally enamored of a nun ten years his senior). Yet there is nothing remotely wishy-washy about Switters. He doesn't merely pack a pistol. He is a pistol. And as we dog Switters's strangely elevated heels across four continents, in and out of love and danger, discovering in the process the ""true"" Third Secret of Fatima, we experience Tom Robbins--that fearless storyteller, spiritual renegade, and verbal break dancer--at the top of his game. On one level this is a fast-paced CIA adventure story with comic overtones; on another it's a serious novel of ideas that brings the Big Picture into unexpected focus; but perhaps more than anything else, Fierce Invalids is a sexy celebration of language and life.Praise for Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates""Superb.""--New York Post""Dangerous? Wicked? Forbidden? You bet. . . . Pour yourself a bowl of chips and dig in.""--Daily News, New York ""Robbins is a great writer . . . and definitely a provocative rascal.""--The Tennessean""Whoever said truth is stranger than fiction never read a Tom Robbins novel. . . Clever, creative, and witty, Robbins tosses off impassioned observations like handfuls of flower petals.""--

Tom Robbins,Wild Ducks Flying Backward,,English,,"Known for his meaty seriocomic novels, Tom Robbins’s shorter work has appeared in publications ranging from Esquire to Harper’s, from Playboy to the New York Times. Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations—and even some untypical country-music lyrics—offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original. Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso’s Guernica, lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls “the genius waitress,” Tom Robbins’s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation. Wherever you open Wild Ducks Flying Backward, you’ll encounter the serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described “romantic Zen hedonist” and “stray dog in the banquet halls of culture.”",,,11/06/05,August 29th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Humor', 'Essays', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'American', 'Contemporary', 'Collections', 'Audiobook']",,9780553383539,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433174912l/8675._SX318_.jpg,3.55,[],92.0,1.0,,8675.Wild_Ducks_Flying_Backward,,,,,88.0,6212.0,272,,Bantam,"['1115', '2043', '2302', '637', '115']",,,[],,

"Tom Segev, Haim Watzman (Goodreads Author) (Translator)","One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate",,English,,"One Palestine, Complete explores the tumultuous period before the creation of the state of Israel. This was the time of the British Mandate, when Britain's promise to both Jews and Arabs that they would inherit the land, set in motion the conflict that haunts the region to this day.Drawing on untapped archival materials, Tom Segev reconstructs an era (1917 to 1948) of limitless possibilities and tragic missteps. He introduces an array unforgettable characters, tracks the steady advance of Jews and Arabs toward confrontation, and puts forth a radical new argument: that the British, far from being pro-Arab, consistently favored the Zionist position, out of the mistaken--and anti-Semitic--belief that Jews turned the wheels of history. Rich in historical detail, sensitive to all perspectives, One Palestine, Complete brilliantly depicts the decline of an empire, the birth of one nation, and the tragedy of another.",,,11/06/99,October 1st 2001,"['David Ben-Gurion', 'Menachem Begin', 'David Lloyd George', 'Bernard Montgomery', 'Arthur Balfour', 'Chaim Weizmann', 'Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby', 'Ernest Bevin', 'Abdullah I of Jordan', 'Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel', 'Clement Attlee', 'Judah L.

Tom Sharpe,Wilt,,English,,"Henry Wilt, tied to a daft job and a domineering wife, has just been passed over for promotion yet again. Ahead of him at the Polytechnic stretch years of trying to thump literature into the heads of plasterers, joiners, butchers and the like. And things are no better at home where his massive wife, Eva, is given to boundless and unpredictable fits of enthusiasm -for transcendental meditation, yoga or the trampoline. But if Wilt can do nothing about his job, he can do something about his wife, in imagination at least, and his fantasies grow daily more murderous and more concrete. After a peculiarly nasty experience at a party thrown by particularly nasty Americans, Wilt finds himself in several embarrassing positions: Eva stalks out in stratospheric dudgeon, and Wilt, under the inspiration of gin, puts one of his more vindictive fantasies into effect. But suspicions are instantly aroused and Wilt rapidly achieves an unenviable notoriety in the role of The Man Helping Police With Their Enquiries. Or is he exactly helping? Wilt's problem -although he's on the other side of the fence -is the same as Inspector Flint's: where is Eva Wilt? But Wilt begins to flourish in the heat of the investigation, and as the police stoke the flames of circumstantial evidence, Wilt deploys all his powers to show that the Law can't tell a Missing Person from a hole in the ground.",Wilt #1,,10/28/76,November 7th 2002,['Henry Wilt'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Modern', '20th Century', 'Audiobook']",,9780099435488,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400595323l/420966.jpg,3.95,[],267.0,3.0,,420966.Wilt,,,,,93.0,10470.0,336,,Arrow,"['3318', '4158', '2312', '534', '148']",,,[],,

His colleagues believe him to be responsible for triggering a departmental inquiry, and his old adversary Inspector Flint, knowing that he's guilty of something, sees a chance to settle a number of scores. What his wife thinks is... well, what all wives think. But what none of them have reckoned with is Wilt's talent for making new enemies.

Tom Standage (Goodreads Author),A History of the World in 6 Glasses,,English,,"Throughout human history, certain drinks have done much more than just quench thirst. As Tom Standage relates with authority and charm, six of them have had a surprisingly pervasive influence on the course of history, becoming the defining drink during a pivotal historical period. A History of the World in 6 Glasses tells the story of humanity from the Stone Age to the 21st century through the lens of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola. Beer was first made in the Fertile Crescent and by 3000 B.C.E. was so important to Mesopotamia and Egypt that it was used to pay wages. In ancient Greece wine became the main export of her vast seaborne trade, helping spread Greek culture abroad. Spirits such as brandy and rum fueled the Age of Exploration, fortifying seamen on long voyages and oiling the pernicious slave trade. Although coffee originated in the Arab world, it stoked revolutionary thought in Europe during the Age of Reason, when coffeehouses became centers of intellectual exchange. And hundreds of years after the Chinese began drinking tea, it became especially popular in Britain, with far-reaching effects on British foreign policy. Finally, though carbonated drinks were invented in 18th-century Europe they became a 20th-century phenomenon, and Coca-Cola in particular is the leading symbol of globalization.For Tom Standage, each drink is a kind of technology, a catalyst for advancing culture by which he demonstrates the intricate interplay of different civilizations.

Tom Waters (Goodreads Author),If They Can't Take a Joke: Confrontational Humor for the Casual Bibliophile,,English,,"Critically lauded Buffalo humor writer Tom Waters sharpens his craft with essays to razor precision in his fourth published collection of wickedly subversive and laugh out loud rants, essays, and celebrity interviews. The author reloads his calculated wit on topics like babies, pornography, restaurants, relationships, driving, wrestling, coffee addiction, weight gain, psychotherapy, writers portrayed in film, the eroding laziness of our culture, drive-thrus, cooking, republicans, and the agony of shopping for clothes with women. The collection also reprints some of Tom's most popular celebrity interviews with author Bret Easton Ellis, comic legends Mike Carey and Brian Azzarello and cult film director Lloyd Kaufman. Waters has enjoyed a rabid cult following among his fans and continues to shock, amuse, and offend with his no-nonsense brand of confrontational rants. Compared as a cross between Andy Rooney, Dennis Miller and Denis Leary, his angst-fueled nonfiction endures as a legacy to the Y generation, an amusing threat to baby boomers, and an inspiration to angry young men the world over. His books and articles have appeared in over four countries and have thus far sold thousands of copies. He's performed his work on the radio, on stage, and in print for almost twenty years, garnering an award for humor from Columbia University and finding publication in The Buffalo News, ArtVoice, Night Life Magazine, Acid Logic, Film Fax, Too Much Coffee Man Magazine, and The Circle, among others.

Tom Wolfe,I am Charlotte Simmons,,English,,"Tom Wolfe, the master social novelist of our time, the spot-on chronicler of all things contemporary and cultural, presents a sensational new novel about life, love, and learning--or the lack of it--amid today's American colleges.Our story unfolds at fictional Dupont University: those Olympian halls of scholarship housing the cream of America's youth, the roseate Gothic spires and manicured lawns suffused with tradition . . . Or so it appears to beautiful, brilliant Charlotte Simmons, a sheltered freshman from North Carolina. But Charlotte soon learns, to her mounting dismay, that for the upper-crust coeds of Dupont, sex, cool, and kegs trump academic achievement every time.As Charlotte encounters the paragons of Dupont's privileged elite--her roommate, Beverly, a Groton-educated Brahmin in lusty pursuit of lacrosse players; Jojo Johanssen, the only white starting player on Dupont's godlike basketball team, whose position is threatened by a hotshot black freshman from the projects; the Young Turk of Saint Ray fraternity, Hoyt Thorpe, whose heady sense of entitlement and social domination is clinched by his accidental brawl with a bodyguard for the governor of California; and Adam Geller, one of the Millennial Mutants who run the university's ""independent"" newspaper and who consider themselves the last bastion of intellectual endeavor on the sex-crazed, jock-obsessed campus--she is seduced by the heady glamour of acceptance, betraying both her values and upbringing before she grasps the power of being different--and the exotic allure of her own innocence.With his trademark satirical wit and famously sharp eye for telling detail, Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons draws on extensive observations at campuses across the country to immortalize the early-21st-century college-going experience.",,,12/09/04,August 30th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'College', 'Coming Of Age', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'American', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook']",,9780312424442,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442453877l/231._SY475_.jpg,3.42,['Bad Sex in Fiction Award (2004)'],337.0,4.0,,231.I_am_Charlotte_Simmons,,,,,80.0,24088.0,738,,Picador USA,"['4403', '7759', '7188', '3146', '1592']",,,[],,

The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta conglomerate king whose outsize ego has at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 29,000 acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife, and a half-empty office complex with a staggering load of debt.Meanwhile, Conrad Hensley, idealistic young father of two, is laid off from his job at the Croker Global Foods warehouse near Oakland and finds himself spiraling into the lower depths of the American legal system.And back in Atlanta, when star Georgia Tech running back Fareek “the Canon” Fanon, a homegrown product of the city’s slums, is accused of date-raping the daughter of a pillar of the white establishment, upscale black lawyer Roger White II is asked to represent Fanon and help keep the city’s delicate racial balance from blowing sky-high.Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real estate syndicates — Wolfe shows us contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most admired novelist.

Tomasz Jedrowski (Goodreads Author),Swimming in the Dark,,,,"Set in early 1980s Poland against the violent decline of communism, a tender and passionate story of first love between two young men who eventually find themselves on opposite sides of the political divide—a stunningly poetic and heartrending literary debut for fans of Andre Aciman, Garth Greenwell, and Alan Hollinghurst.When university student Ludwik meets Janusz at a summer agricultural camp, he is fascinated yet wary of this handsome, carefree stranger. But a chance meeting by the river soon becomes an intense, exhilarating, and all-consuming affair. After their camp duties are fulfilled, the pair spend a dreamlike few weeks camping in the countryside, bonding over an illicit copy of James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room. Inhabiting a beautiful natural world removed from society and its constraints, Ludwik and Janusz fall deeply in love. But in their repressive communist and Catholic society, the passion they share is utterly unthinkable.Once they return to Warsaw, the charismatic Janusz quickly rises in the political ranks of the party and is rewarded with a highly-coveted position in the ministry. Ludwik is drawn toward impulsive acts of protest, unable to ignore rising food prices and the stark economic disparity around them. Their secret love and personal and political differences slowly begin to tear them apart as both men struggle to survive in a regime on the brink of collapse.Shifting from the intoxication of first love to the quiet melancholy of growing up and growing apart, Swimming in the Dark is a potent blend of romance, post-war politics, intrigue, and history. Lyrical and sensual, immersive and intense, Tomasz Jedrowski has crafted an indelible and thought-provoking literary debut that explores freedom and love in all its incarnations.",,,,February 6th 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Fiction', 'Queer', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Gay', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Poland']",,9781526604965,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576119793l/49208237._SY475_.jpg,4.21,['HWA Debut Crown Nominee for Longlist (2020)'],100.0,1.0,,49208237-swimming-in-the-dark,,,,,97.0,3524.0,229,,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,"['1511', '1378', '529', '88', '18']",,,[],,

Tomi Lahren,Never Play Dead: How the Truth Makes You Unstoppable,,English,,"The Fox Nation host, Fox News contributor, and social media master argues that it’s time to square your shoulders, stand your ground and speak the truth.The conventional wisdom is that we need more civility and fewer arguments. If you have a controversial option, keep it to yourself. Tomi Lahren could not disagree more. It’s a trick. The same people whining about tone will call you names and applaud those who threaten you. We don’t need safe spaces, and you shouldn’t be patient and wait out the bullying. In Never Play Dead, Lahren encourages all Americans, especially women, to find their voice and speak out. She skewers the hypocrisy of the self-esteem movement that has made people afraid to stand up for themselves. Wherever Lahren goes, the # 1 question she gets isn’t about politics. It’s about her confidence in herself, her beliefs and who she is. Never Play Dead not only answers this question but helps you learn how to stand your ground, discover how resilient you are and find your fearless side. In this book, she offers the antidote to all that: worry less about who might offend, and focus on who you might inspire. In the long-run, you will never regret being forceful when the truth is on your side.Lahren worked her way out of South Dakota to television fame in LA, surviving social isolation, a truly terrible boyfriend, awful workplaces, and getting fired in front of a million haters. Along the way, she was tempted to keep quiet, but she never did. Now she calls out the comment trolls, the political correctness police, the terminally jealous, and the ever-escalation victim culture that tells you all your failures are because of the system (and therefore there’s nothing you can do about it). Whether you’ve been told you’re not good enough by parents, lovers, frenemies, bad bosses, or social media, it’s time to take Lahren’s advice and fight back. It’s better to lose friends and followers than to lose yourself. The truth is, you may find more people who agree with you than you think. It’s time to shed your fear.

The genealogy of early Calvinist Puritanism mixed with the techno-scientific religion of boundless economic progress and legally veiled in the obscure para-Biblical and Jewish-inspired sense of political self-chosenness, created a system that has little in common with its original design.

"Tommy Kovac (Goodreads Author), Sonny Liew (Goodreads Author)",Wonderland,,English,,"Among the numerous curiosities that have gone unexplained in the classic tale Alice in Wonderland, perhaps the most perplexing might be who, exactly, is the ""Maryann"" that the White Rabbit mistakes Alice for at the beginning of the story? Lewis Carroll first made us ponder this and, years later, Walt Disney again made viewers wonder who Maryann might be in his classic feature length film based on Carroll's book. Now, the amazingly talented folks at SLG Publishing, through a licensing deal with Disney, have finally answered this age-old question. In their beautifully executed comic book series, WONDERLAND, readers experience Alice's fantastic world as they've never seen it before. Writer Tommy Kovac's Wonderland is missing Alice herself, but it's still populated by the other characters that make the world such a curiously exciting place. The Queen of Hearts is present, barking orders to lop off people's heads, as is the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter and the rest of Wonderland's beloved cast. And there are some new faces, too, including the book's main protagonist, the mysterious Maryann herself. All are beautifully illustrated by Wonderland's artist, Sonny Liew.The graphic novel will collect the six issues that comprised the Wonderland comic series in a beautiful, collectible, jacketed hardcover edition.

Tommy Wieringa,Joe Speedboot,,Dutch,,"Joe Speedboot is een roman over liefde en rivaliteit, over een verlosser zonder belofte en een heroïsche odyssee. Het toont het lot van nieuwkomers in een Nederlands dorp, waar de last van het onverwerkte verleden op de inwoners drukt. De tragikomische maalstroom van gebeurtenissen geeft het ingeslapen dorp een onverwachte dynamiek waar het niet meer van zal herstellen.Tommy Wieringa schreef met Joe Speedboot een gedreven, aanstekelijke ontwikkelingsroman, met een hoofdrol voor de mateloze verbeeldingskracht van één man.Fransje Hermans, de verteller van het verhaal, is na een ongeluk invalide geraakt en heeft voorgoed zijn spraakvermogen verloren. Hij is de zelfbenoemde chroniqueur van het dorp Lomark.

Eens zorgde zijn vader voor hem, nu zorgt hij voor zijn vader. Lang geleden stortte een Russische piloot neer in het maisveld achter hun huis.

"Tony Cartalucci, Nile Bowie","Subverting Syria: How CIA Contra Gangs and NGOs Manufacture, Mislabel and Market Mass Murder",,English,,"A book to beat the bombing - Expose the Big Lie in time to stop the war. The Syrian ""uprising"" is actually a cynical US-engineered plot using provocateurs, mercenaries, wahhabi fanatics and corrupt NGO's. The US, UK and Israel are determined to smash this independent Arab socialist state where oil wealth is spent on human welfare, like Libya before it was torn apart in the same way. Neighboring nations move in for the kill, like jackals and hyenas fawning at the feet of the US lion.The US and Saudi-financed plot turns on the tactic of ""Countergangs."" Terrorists -- mercenaries and irregulars, the ""CIA foreign legion"" -- they shoot both demonstrators and police, blow up buildings, massacre innocent villagers -- and then blame the carnage on the targeted government! NGO's like NED, the ""National Endowment for Democracy"" (funded by US State Dept, Geo. Soros, Ford Foundation etc) promote ""activists,"" whose leaders are ambitious sociopaths, eagerly carving out a piece of the carcass for the moment the state is brought down. The corporate lapdog media eagerly lap up and magnify the Big Lie, creating a fake ""reality"" that the average person has little chance of seeing through.Subverting Syria is a warning of the horror that the ""Empire of the Almighty Dollar"" is preparing to bring down upon Syria, the same horror of last year's obscene war on Libya, in which an egalitarian state was trampled into mud, blood and chaos under the banner of human rights and a pack of vicious lies.Subverting Syria reveals how the crusade to destroy Syria follows tactics explicitly set out in the Pentagon's Unconventional Warfare Manual, the same maneuvers so recently used to lay waste to Libya. - fund NGO's to create a climate of protest in the target country- provocateurs organize demonstrations, then fire on protesters and security forces alike to stoke violence- staged and mislabeled video footage creates the illusion of repression by the regime- mass media endlessly repeat the Big Lie that the nation's leader is a brutal dictator. Give a dog a bad name and hang him.- invade border towns with special forces death squads, the CIA Foreign Legion of Al Qaeda psychopaths, fanatics and guns for hire - foment a civil war and fabricate pretexts for military intervention by the UN, or NATO- bomb the country into the stone age, to be conquered by NATO’s Islamic terrorist puppets- eradicate Arab socialism and government for the people, replacing it with a corrupt clique beholden to Wall Street and London bankers- isolate Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq and Iran, giving free rein for Greater Israel to dominate the Middle East- US corporations write multi-billion-dollar contracts for ""reconstruction"" and ""security""Subverting Syria shows how these wars are engineered by manipulation of the kinder instincts of mankind, the hoodwinking and harnessing of elements that normally oppose ""interventions"", especially pacifist and leftist forces -- entrapping them in the service of mass murder and the global dictatorship of the money power.Syria’s situation is truly serious, under ruthless attack by enemies within and without.

He was also a musical genius who inspired whole generations of artists, a generous friend to nearly everyone who crossed his path, a guileless man of immense personal charm to whom the sweetest sound on earth was surf music.A generation after his death, Moon is still revered as the greatest drummer in rock history and the single wildest personality in an age of pop excess. Here is the truth behind the legend, the result of more than three years of research in which music journalist Tony Fletcher interviewed dozens of Moon's friends, colleagues, and associates. The result is an instant classic that brilliantly illuminates both the tender and self-destructive sides of this singular personality.

Tony Hendra,Father Joe: The Man Who Saved My Soul,,English,,"A key comic writer of the past three decades has created his most heartfelt and hard-hitting book. Father Joe is Tony Hendra’s inspiring true story of finding faith, friendship, and family through the decades-long influence of a surpassingly wise Benedictine monk named Father Joseph Warrillow.Like everything human, it started with sex. In 1955, fourteen-year-old Tony found himself entangled with a married Catholic woman. In Cold War England, where Catholicism was the subject of news stories and Graham Greene bestsellers, Tony was whisked off by the woman’s husband to see a priest and be saved.Yet what he found was a far cry from the priests he’d known at Catholic school, where boys were beaten with belts or set upon by dogs. Instead, he met Father Joe, a gentle, stammering, ungainly Benedictine who never used the words “wrong” or “guilt,” who believed that God was in everyone and that “the only sin was selfishness.” During the next forty years, as his life and career drastically ebbed and flowed, Tony discovered that his visits to Father Joe remained the one constant in his life—the relationship that, in the most serious sense, saved it.From the fifties and his adolescent desire to join an abbey himself; to the sixties, when attending Cambridge and seeing the satire of Beyond the Fringe convinced him to change the world with laughter, not prayer; to the seventies and successful stints as an original editor of National Lampoon and a writer of Lemmings, the off-Broadway smash that introduced John Belushi and Chevy Chase; to professional disaster after co-creating the legendary English series Spitting Image; from drinking to drugs, from a failed first marriage to a successful second and the miracle of parenthood—the years only deepened Tony’s need for the wisdom of his other and more real father, creating a bond that could not be broken, even by death.A startling departure for this acclaimed satirist, Father Joe is a sincere account of how Tony Hendra learned to love. It’s the story of a whole generation looking for a way back from mockery and irony, looking for its own Father Joe, and a testament to one of the most charismatic mentors in modern literature.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/01/04,May 31st 2005,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Biography Memoir', 'Catholic', 'Audiobook', 'Christianity', 'Autobiography']",,9780812972344,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320501474l/143685.jpg,3.76,[],86.0,1.0,,143685.Father_Joe,,,,,89.0,1772.0,304,,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['466', '653', '457', '149', '47']",,,[],,

Tony Horwitz,Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War,,English,,"When prize-winning war correspondent Tony Horwitz leaves the battlefields of Bosnia and the Middle East for a peaceful corner of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he thinks he's put war zones behind him. But awakened one morning by the crackle of musket fire, Horwitz starts filing front-line dispatches again this time from a war close to home, and to his own heart.Propelled by his boyhood passion for the Civil War, Horwitz embarks on a search for places and people still held in thrall by America's greatest conflict. The result is an adventure into the soul of the unvanquished South, where the ghosts of the Lost Cause are resurrected through ritual and remembrance.In Virginia, Horwitz joins a band of 'hardcore' reenactors who crash-diet to achieve the hollow-eyed look of starved Confederates; in Kentucky, he witnesses Klan rallies and calls for race war sparked by the killing of a white man who brandishes a rebel flag; at Andersonville, he finds that the prison's commander, executed as a war criminal, is now exalted as a martyr and hero; and in the book's climax, Horwitz takes a marathon trek from Antietam to Gettysburg to Appomattox in the company of Robert Lee Hodge, an eccentric pilgrim who dubs their odyssey the 'Civil Wargasm.'Written with Horwitz's signature blend of humor, history, and hard-nosed journalism, Confederates in the Attic brings alive old battlefields and new ones 'classrooms, courts, country bars' where the past and the present collide, often in explosive ways. Poignant and picaresque, haunting and hilarious, it speaks to anyone who has ever felt drawn to the mythic South and to the dark romance of the Civil War.",,,03/03/98,February 22nd 1999,"['William Tecumseh Sherman', 'Stonewall Jackson', 'Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.', 'Julia Ward Howe', 'George Pickett', 'Braxton Bragg', 'Albert Sidney Johnston', 'Robert Lee Hodge', 'Pleasant Crump', 'Robert Livingstone', 'Abe Stice', 'Caleb Senter', 'Denmark Vesey', 'Robert Penn Warren', 'Michael Westerman', 'Damien Darden', 'Freddie Morrow', 'Karen Meinhold', 'Shelby Foote', 'Edward Hopper', 'James K.

Tony Judt,Ill Fares the Land,,English,,"Something is profoundly wrong with the way we think about how we should live today.In Ill Fares The Land, Tony Judt, one of our leading historians and thinkers, reveals how we have arrived at our present dangerously confused moment. Judt masterfully crystallizes what we’ve all been feeling into a way to think our way into, and thus out of, our great collective dis-ease about the current state of things.As the economic collapse of 2008 made clear, the social contract that defined postwar life in Europe and America – the guarantee of a basal level of security, stability and fairness -- is no longer guaranteed; in fact, it’s no longer part of the common discourse. Judt offers the language we need to address our common needs, rejecting the nihilistic individualism of the far right and the debunked socialism of the past. To find a way forward, we must look to our not so distant past and to social democracy in action: to re-enshrining fairness over mere efficiency.Distinctly absent from our national dialogue, social democrats believe that the state can play an enhanced role in our lives without threatening our liberties. Instead of placing blind faith in the market—as we have to our detriment for the past thirty years—social democrats entrust their fellow citizens and the state itself.Ill Fares the Land challenges us to confront our societal ills and to shoulder responsibility for the world we live in. For hope remains. In reintroducing alternatives to the status quo, Judt reinvigorates our political conversation, providing the tools necessary to imagine a new form of governance, a new way of life.",,,10/30/10,March 18th 2010,"['Bill Clinton', 'John Maynard Keynes', 'Tony Blair', 'Benito Mussolini', 'Barack Obama', 'Malcolm X', 'George Orwell', 'Joseph McCarthy', 'Milton Friedman', 'Gordon Brown', 'Friedrich Hayek', 'Lyndon B.

A mischievous artist kicks off a game of graffiti tag on a local overpass by painting the simple phrase, “Uh-oh.” An anonymous interlocutor writes back: “When?” Someone slyly answers: “Just a couple of days.” But what happens in just a couple of days? Professor Blip Korterly is arrested, his friend Dr. Flake Fountain is drafted into a shadow-government research project to develop the ultimate biological weapon, and an accidental outbreak turns into a merry-hearted, babble-inducing apocalypse that will either destroy humankind or take it to the next step in evolution.""Just a Couple of Days. From this seemingly harmless bit of highway graffiti springs Tony Vigorito's inventive debut novel, a madcap adventure of a sinister government plot and an apocalyptic vision worthy of Kurt Vonnegut... After being conscripted as the genetics expert for a secret military project, Dr. Flake Fountain, a molecular geneticist at a major university, is thrust into the (literally) underground development of a biological agent with the power to disable enemies’ symbolic capacity, leaving them unable to communicate. But Just a Couple of Days is no mere sci-fi daydream. Vigorito’s research is impressive, and the narrative pops with linguistic acrobatics reminiscent of Tom Robbins… Vigorito engages in consistently dazzling wordplay, and readers will eagerly follow the narrative as it moves beyond the conventional boundaries of storytelling… An underground cult classic."" —Kirkus Reviews",,,09/01/01,April 2nd 2007,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Humor', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Comedy', 'Literature', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', '21st Century', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780156031226,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441708098l/419916._SY475_.jpg,3.63,['Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) for Visionary Fiction (2002)'],142.0,2.0,,419916.Just_a_Couple_of_Days,,,,,82.0,2786.0,400,,Mariner Books,"['839', '800', '641', '303', '203']",,,[],,
Tony Vigorito (Goodreads Author),Nine Kinds of Naked,,English,,"""As fanciful and inventive in its form... as it is in its observations... It fed tasty crackers to all the hungry parrots in my mental aviary."" —TOM ROBBINSJoin cult favorite Tony Vigorito in his acclaimed, surreal whirlwind of a novel exploring chaos theory. A prisoner spins a playing card into a somersault, stirring a wind that becomes a tornado that takes off the roof of a church in nearby Normal, Illinois. Elizabeth Wildhack is born in that church and someday she will meet that prisoner, a man named Diablo, on the streets of New Orleans—where a hurricane-like Great White Spot hovers off the coast. But how is it all interconnected? And what does it have to do with a time-traveling serf and a secret society whose motto is “Walk away?”""Linguistic gymnastics abound… Vigorito demonstrates once again that he's a wild stylist… startlingly original… an entertaining anarchist…"" —The Chicago Sun-Times""Chaos theory says that a tiny, almost imperceptible event can have large, even catastrophic coincidences: a butterfly flapping its wings in North America leads to a hurricane on another continent, for example. In this fictional take on chaos theory, several offbeat characters are linked by a single event that expands through time, sweeping them up in it and changing their lives. A traveler works a nifty trick with a playing card, and a tornado strikes a small Illinois town; a woman is born during the tornado and later meets the man who set it in motion; 1,200 years earlier, a man who is supposed to be stoned to death discovers he has an uncanny knack for surviving; and, back in the present day, another man speaks only in the present tense. Comparisons of this novel to the works of Tom Robbins are both obvious and appropriate: the story meanders around in an entertaining manner, never getting too serious about itself; the characters are splendidly loopy, close to caricature but never quite reaching it, and the situations in which they find themselves are comic, dramatic, and everything in between."" —Booklist",,,,October 6th 2008,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Humor', 'Comedy', 'Philosophy', 'Contemporary', 'Audiobook', 'Time Travel', 'Literature', 'Fantasy']",,9780156031233,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442776655l/3288140._SY475_.jpg,3.74,[],100.0,1.0,,3288140-nine-kinds-of-naked,,,,,84.0,894.0,416,,Mariner Books,"['285', '270', '200', '101', '38']",,,[],,

And enjoy it I did."" —TOM ROBBINSAcclaimed for his surreal, satirical vision and his “consistently dazzling” (Kirkus Reviews) writing style, cult favorite Tony Vigorito stretches the boundaries of storytelling beyond all limits with his long-awaited third novel. A quest to find the treasure of all treasures launches this swashbuckling tale of romance and high adventure across three centuries and takes you on a hilarious and visionary journey that includes lovers, pirates, bank robbers, treasure maps, yoga cults, love potions, assassins, con artists, quicksand, smugglers, and rock-paper-scissors.

Six-year-old Sheila was abandoned by her mother on a highway when she was four. A survivor of horrific abuse, she never spoke, never cried, and was placed in a class for severely retarded children after committing an atrocious act of violence against another child. Everyone thought Sheila was beyond salvation—except her teacher, Torey Hayden. With patience, skill, and abiding love, she fought long and hard to release a haunted little girl from her secret nightmare—and nurture the spark of genius she recognised trapped within Sheila's silence. This is the remarkable story of their journey together—an odyssey of hope, courage, and inspiring devotion that opened the heart and mind of one lost child to a new world of discovery and joy.",Sheila #1,,01/01/80,June 28th 2016,"['Torey', 'Sheila']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Memoir', 'Education', 'Biography', 'Abuse', 'True Story', 'Inspirational', 'Biography Memoir', 'Teaching']",,9780062564436,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1508110381l/28960224._SY475_.jpg,4.26,[],683.0,9.0,,28960224-one-child,,,,,96.0,10882.0,304,,William Morrow Paperbacks,"['5330', '3571', '1574', '324', '83']",,,[],,

Torey L. Hayden,Den mekaniska katten,,Swedish,,"Conor är nio år, en blek pojke med ljust skinande hår - James, som är familjeterapeut, tycker att han liknar en ande, med hår som månljus. Conor har diagnosticerats som autistisk, men James börjar misstänka att pojken lider av sviterna av en traumatisk händelse. Då Conor inleder sin terapi är han till en början onåbar. Han vägrar släppa ifrån sig sin leksakskatt som tycks vara hans enda trygghet. Genom kattens nos utforskar han världen - «katten vet allt«.Conors mor Laura är en känd författare.

Parallellt får vi följa Lauras historia: Hennes mor dog tidigt och Laura hamnade i fosterhem där hon utsattes för sexuella övergrepp av «bröderna«.

Men under sin utbildning dras hon allt mer in i new age-kretsar där hon träffar Fergus, en karismatisk man som tror att Laura är Torgons språkrör i denna värld. Men Laura upptäcker att Fergus är psykiskt labil och hon lämnar honom och sina studier och återvänder till landsbygden, där hon omsätter sina fantasier om Torgon i populära böcker.Conor får allt större förtroende för James och uttrycker sig allt tydligare: han berättar om ett ""spöke"" som kommit till ranchen då fadern var bortrest och att modern varit blodig om händerna. Så står sanningen plötsligt klar. Fergus har jagat Laura i åratal och till slut har hon dödat honom och grävt ned liket i skogen.

"Torquato Tasso, Anthony M. Esolen (Translator & Editor)",Jerusalem Delivered,,English,,"Arguably the greatest Italian poet after Dante, Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento in 1544 and died in Rome in 1595, having served as the court poet in Ferrara, been confined for years in a madhouse after attacking a servant with a knife, and composed one of the great works of Renaissance literature. Unjustly neglected today, Tasso's epic poem 'Jerusalem Delivered'(first published in 1581) is set in the 11th century and tells the story of the First Crusade and the siege which gave Christian armies control over Jerusalem and the Holy Lands for a time.As in other epic poems, 'Jerusalem Delivered' deftly mixes history and myth. Tasso's heroes - Godfrey, leader of the Christian armies; Rinaldo, bravest of the Christian warriors; and Tancred, the Italian prince who falls in love with the pagan warrioress Clorinda, whom he eventually (andsimultaneously) converts and kills - must face not only the Saracens and their allies, but also a host of fearsome and manipulative devils, demons, and sorcerers. This is a sweeping and often thrilling tale of war, faith, love, and sex that easily rivals its classical predecessors. Writing at a time when Christianity was bitterly divided, Tasso was naturally concerned with the nature of leadership and loyalty, with the importance of sacrifice, with the evils of corruption, and with the existence of truth, themes that continue to resonate today. No wonder that for three centuries, 'Jerusalem Delivered' was considered the great modern epic. Indeed, Spenser borrowed scenes and episodes from this poem in writing the 'Faerie Queen', and Milton was greatly influenced by Tasso when writing his own Christian epic, 'Paradise Lost'.English-language readers who are familiar with Tasso's grand romance have until now known it only through a verse translation by English poet Edward Fairfax published in 1600. In order to fit Tasso's stanzas into the then popular Spenserian verse form, Fairfax had to alter the original poem considerably. Now, 400 years later, Anthony Esolen presents a new translation that transforms 'Jerusalem Delivered' into an English-language masterpiece. The first major verse translation into English since Fairfax's, Esolen's version is both more true to its original source and more fluid than that of hisElizabethan predecessor. Esolen has translated 'Jerusalem Delivered' with the care of poet, capturing the delight of Tasso's descriptions, the different voices of its cast of characters, the shadingsbetween glory and tragedy, and does them all in an English as powerful as Tasso's Italian. Esolen's will immediately be acclaimed as the definitive translation of this powerful work of faith and war. Like theFagles 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', the Pinsky 'Inferno', and Seamus Heaney's imaginative new rendering of 'Beowulf', Anthony Esolen's bold, fast-moving, and faithful translation of Tasso'sCrusade-era adventure will introduce a new generation of readers to a masterpiece of world literature.",,,1581,July 10th 2000,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Fiction', 'Epic', 'Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Epic Poetry', '16th Century']",,9780801863233,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388460843l/875623.jpg,3.87,[],36.0,1.0,,875623.Jerusalem_Delivered,,,,,90.0,1038.0,504,,Johns Hopkins University Press,"['343', '352', '241', '69', '33']",,,[],,

"Toula Mavridou-Messer (Goodreads Author), Jimmy Messer (Illustrator)",Mortal End: A Simmering Pit of Jiggery Pokery,,English,,"Mortal End: A Simmering Pit of Jiggery Pokery is filled with mystery and humour, a tantalising sense of suspense, absurd darkness and larger than life characters, which is no doubt what captured this award-winning Hollywood producer's imagination.Synopsis:""A lightning storm sparks a fire deep in Phooka Wood.The following morning, Mortal End’s self righteous rector Ænus P. Wordsworth, his sidekick Savant Poe and a motley crew of villagers venture into the wood to see what damage has been done.To their amazed befuddlement, right in the centre of the seared earth is a giant mound of molten toffee and within it, a selection of human remains.Ænus P. Wordsworth takes it upon himself to find out who these bones belong to and how they came to be there. In doing so, he uncovers a horrific tale of murder, incest and cannibalism that spreads throughout the neighbouring villages that surround Phooka Wood.Their investigation takes them to all corners of their roundabout world; from Mortal End to the oozing Hamlet of Stifle and Little Napoo. Along their colourful journey, we are introduced to a larger than life cast from Doc Sheare the barber surgeon, Verrye Brutall the handsome woodsman, Beliala Bigswoln the publican’s daughter, Baron Rubigo Bluebeard and Umbra the Bogyman.Everyone seems to have a secret that they are trying to hide that could give clues to the horror of Phooka Wood. Even Ænus P. Wordsworth has something to hide!""Why does guilt hang heavy in this village like offal in a stew? What secret has the God-fearing Ænus P. Wordsworth kept so carefully? Where have all the children gone? These and many other questions will be answered when you read Mortal End.What readers are saying about Mortal End: A Simmering Pit of Jiggery Pokery:""It's a smidge of Dickens, shaken but not stirred with ""A League of Gentlemen"", sort of starcrossed with a bit of Neil Gaiman, plus a soupcon of Terry Pratchett. And totally and utterly your own!”“Mortal End is the funniest and most disturbing adult fairytale ever written.”""My imagination is being flooded with the most enormous canvas of human depravity… and I am finding that it fills me with delight.”""Despite it's subject matter it is light-hearted in it's delivery and the clever way the writer expresses herself is a joy to behold.""""Love the incredibly clever mind of Toula Mavridou-Messer. Excited to read her next book as well!”""Love the prose, the most colourful, creepy, characters in their deliciously rancid world.""""Toula's imagination knows no bounds. Her characters are original and fascinating and leap off the page. She is a smart writer with the ability to make a story exciting and mysterious and will take your breath away."" - LA WRITERS CENTERMortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, the debut novel from Toula Mavridou-Messer, was written in the space of three weeks after two car crashes in just one hour. Even the rescue serviceman who came to collect her from the mangled wreckage was hesitant about transporting her, saying, ""Things happen in threes, don't they?""""It's a sign,"" thought Toula, as those crashes came during the return journey from a residential crime writing course she attended, given by best-selling author Val McDermid. She had been battling a major problem faced by so many would-be authors - that of actually finishing a project and then doing something with it.Facing death head on seems to have been the antidote, although not necessarily recommended as a remedy for all. Every time Toula was faced with either a blank page or the option of walking away from the type-writer, she remembered that she had been spared a fate worse than death...or in fact, death and that small fact kept her chained to her desk.Fortunately she saw the funny side and hopefully so will you when you read Mortal End: A Simmering Pit Of Jiggery Pokery, available from Amazon, Kindle and Barnes & Noble.",,,07/27/14,July 28th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,"['Mystery', 'Fantasy']",,B00M7JABLK,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407025016l/22854779.jpg,4.29,[],100.0,1.0,,22854779-mortal-end,,,,,90.0,31.0,178,,100 Percent Publishing,"['21', '4', '3', '0', '3']",,,[],,

The comic strip reached out to adults with its gentle and droll sense of humor.

  A SCANDINAVIAN MIDCENTURY CLASSIC BACK IN PRINTWho Will Comfort Toffle? is the timeless, magical tale of the wistful wallflower, Toffle–too shy to speak to anyone and too fearful of the world he is watching from afar.

His insecurity continues to only serve his isolation until he has the courage to overcome his fears by reaching out to another frightened introvert, the mesmerizing Miffle. Who Will Comfort Toffle? is an endearing, introspective story that will speak to readers of all ages—anyone who has ever needed a friend to pull them out of their shell.Joining Drawn & Quarterly’s archival series of Moomin The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip, Moomin, Mymble & Little My, and the Moomintroll chapter books is the glorious reprinting of the Tove Jansson classic children’s book Who Will Comfort Toffle? with a loving translation by British poet Sophie Hannah.

Tracy Chevalier (Goodreads Author),Girl with a Pearl Earring,,English,,"With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s.

He has been described by the Baltimore Sun as the ""master of the non-fiction narrative."" This powerful and inspiring new book shows how one person can make a difference, as Kidder tells the true story of a gifted man who is in love with the world and has set out to do all he can to cure it.At the center of Mountains Beyond Mountains stands Paul Farmer. Doctor, Harvard professor, renowned infectious-disease specialist, anthropologist, the recipient of a MacArthur ""genius"" grant, world-class Robin Hood, Farmer was brought up in a bus and on a boat, and in medical school found his life’s calling: to diagnose and cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. This magnificent book shows how radical change can be fostered in situations that seem insurmountable, and it also shows how a meaningful life can be created, as Farmer—brilliant, charismatic, charming, both a leader in international health and a doctor who finds time to make house calls in Boston and the mountains of Haiti—blasts through convention to get results.Mountains Beyond Mountains takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes minds and practices through his dedication to the philosophy that ""the only real nation is humanity""—a philosophy that is embodied in the small public charity he founded, Partners in Health. He enlists the help of the Gates Foundation, George Soros, the U.N.’s World Health Organization, and others in his quest to cure the world. At the heart of this book is the example of a life based on hope, and on an understanding of the truth of the Haitian proverb ""Beyond mountains there are mountains"": as you solve one problem, another problem presents itself, and so you go on and try to solve that one too.""Mountains Beyond Mountains unfolds with the force of a gathering revelation,"" says Annie Dillard, and Jonathan Harr says, ""[Farmer] wants to change the world.

Tracy Lynn,Snow: A Retelling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,,English,,"""ONCE UPON A TIME"" IS TIMELESS  The Duchess Jessica's childhood began with a tragedy: her mother's death. Her father, heartbroken at the loss of his beloved wife, could not bear to raise the child. Largely ignored, Jessica spent the first eleven years of her life running free on the family estate, cared for only by the servants.  Then her father decides to remarry, bringing an end to Jessica's independence. At first her new stepmother just seems overly strict. But as Jessica grows into a beautiful young woman, it becomes clear that her stepmother is also wildly -- and murderously -- jealous of her.  Jessica escapes to London. Going by the name Snow to hide from her family, she falls in love with an odd band of outcasts who accept her into their makeshift family.

Tracy Michele Leininger,Alone Yet Not Alone,,English,,"Autumn of 1755 bestowed to the Leiningers’ world, not only its rich beauties, but also a rewarding harvest. On this particular day the whole valley seemed to rejoice in the fullness of the season—but suddenly Barbara and Regina’s peaceful frontier life is changed forever. General Braddock and his army had been defeated and soon the Pennsylvania settlers would suffer the bloody effects of the French and Indian War. On October 16, 1755, a band of Indians, led by Allegheny warriors, stormed through Buffalo Valley, burned the Leiningers’ log cabin, and captured the sisters. Few survived the Penn’s Creek Massacre and even fewer lived to tell the story. Regina makes a promise to her older sister just before they are unwillingly separated—each to endure different fates. Barbara is taken deep into the wilderness, but holds on to the hope that she will find her little sister. Though she is adopted into the Indian tribe, there is a longing deep inside that cannot be denied. She must escape—but the penalty if caught is certain death. No one expresses Barbara’s apprehensions better than her own words, written in 1759: “If one could not believe that there is a God, who helps and saves from death, one had better let running away alone...The extreme probability that the Indians would pursue and recapture us, was two to one compared with the dim hope that, perhaps, we would get through...even if we did escape the Indians, how would we ever succeed in passing through the wilderness, unacquainted with a single path or trail…""",,,,August 1st 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Christian', 'Christian Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult', 'Adventure', 'Native Americans', 'Juvenile']",,9781929241361,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316636403l/912147.jpg,4.12,[],94.0,1.0,,912147.Alone_Yet_Not_Alone,,,,,94.0,1146.0,203,,His Seasons,"['507', '354', '215', '54', '16']",,,[],,

Tremper Longman III,How to Read the Psalms,,English,,"The Psalms possess an enduring fascination for us. For frankness, directness, intensity and intimacy, they are unrivaled in all of Scripture. Somehow the psalmists seem to have anticipated all our awe, desires and frustrations. No wonder Christians have used the Psalms in worship from the earliest times to the present. Yet the Psalms cause us difficulties when we look at them closely. Their poetry is unfamiliar in form. Many images they use are foreign to us today. And the psalmists sometimes express thoughts that seem unworthy of Scripture. Tremper Longman gives us the kind of help we need to overcome the distance between the psalmists' world and ours. He explains the various kinds of psalms, the way they were used in Hebrew worship and their relationship to the rest of the Old Testament.

Tremper Longman III,How to Read Proverbs,,English,,"Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife.A perverse person spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.Go to the ant, you lazybones; consider its ways, and be wise. Everyday we make choices on the path of life. Proverbs are memorable capsules of wisdom, chiseled in words and polished through use by those who have traveled that path ahead of us. But the proverbs of the Bible make a greater claim than ""a penny saved is a penny earned."" They are woven into the web of divine revelation, rooted in the ""fear of the Lord"" that is the beginning of wisdom. While many proverbs speak to us directly, we can gain much greater insight by studying the book of Proverbs as a whole, understanding its relationship to ancient non-Israelite wisdom and listening to its conversation with the other great voices of wisdom in Scripture--Job and Ecclesiastes. In How to Read Proverbs Tremper Longman III provides a welcome guide to reading and studying, understanding and savoring the Proverbs for all their wisdom.

But we miss the point if we focus on what seems strange to us. And we distort the message if we demand that this book answer questions that are strange to it. To read Genesis intelligently, we must consider the questions, the literature and the times in which Genesis was written. In How to Read Genesis Tremper Longman III provides a welcome guide to reading and studying, understanding and savoring this panorama of beginnings--of both the world and of Israel.

"Tremper Longman III, John H. Walton, Stephen O. Moshier (Contributor)","The Lost World of the Flood: Mythology, Theology, and the Deluge Debate",,,,"""The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth . . . and the ark floated on the face of the waters"" (Gen 6:17-18 NRSV). In modern times the Genesis flood account has been probed and analyzed for answers to scientific, apologetic, and historical questions. It is a text that has called forth ""flood geology,"" fueled searches for remnants of the ark on Mount Ararat, and inspired a full-size replica of Noah's ark in a theme park. Some claim that the very veracity of Scripture hinges on a particular reading of the flood narrative. But do we understand what we are reading? Longman and Walton urge us to ask what the biblical author might have been saying to his ancient audience. Our quest to rediscover the biblical flood requires that we set aside our own cultural and interpretive assumptions and visit the distant world of the ancient Near East. Responsible interpretation calls for the patient examination of the text within its ancient context of language, literature, and thought. And as we return from that lost world to our own, we will need to ask whether geological science supports the notion of flood geology. To read Longman and Walton is to put our feet on firmer interpretive ground. Without attempting to answer all of our questions, they lift the fog of modernity and allow the sunlight to reveal the true contours of the text. As with other books in the Lost World series, The Lost World of the Flood is an informative and enlightening journey toward a more responsible reading of a timeless biblical narrative.",The Lost World Series #5,,,April 3rd 2018,[],Paperback,"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Old Testament', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Christianity']",,9780830852000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518174438l/36688744.jpg,4.13,[],60.0,1.0,,36688744-the-lost-world-of-the-flood,,,,,96.0,249.0,192,,IVP Academic,"['85', '121', '34', '9', '0']",,,[],,

There are no secrets, no quiet moments. There is no privacy. Behind the veil of work and life, Democracy, free enterprise, and the roar of restaurants, bars, and blockbuster movies there are the Watchers a secret branch of the US government with the sole task of spying on the American public through hidden cameras, tapped phones, the Internet, satellites, and even safe, sensible modern appliances. Then one day a young man named Joe Blake looks back through the monitor, locks eyes with an aging Watcher and says, ""I know you're out there. I know you're listening."" Systems at the Watcher compound go dark, malfunctions run rampant, and the agency begins a meticulous investigation into Joe's life. Through the surveillance record we watch as he grows into a troubled rock star witnessing the downward spiral of the American economy from the road. We watch his fight against a corrupt corporate takeover of a government formally by and for the people, and we see the end of our way of life in the small compromises that go overlooked or unnoticed. Joe declares war on the system, but can he complete his mission before the Watchers track him down through his own past?

Trevor Noah,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,,English,,"The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.",,,,November 15th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Africa', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race', 'South Africa']",,9780385689229,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911l/29780253.jpg,4.45,"['Evergreen Teen Book Award Nominee (2019)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2019)', 'NAACP Image Award for Debut Author and for Biography / Auto-biography (2017)', 'Thurber Prize for American Humor (2017)']",1673.0,19.0,,29780253-born-a-crime,,,,,96.0,389493.0,289,,Doubleday Canada,"['237649', '111515', '26564', '6906', '6859']",,,['Johannesburg (South Africa)'],,

    ALL WARS HAVE RULES 
  
  
    Rule Number One: No killing innocent bystanders. 
  
  
    Rule Number Two: No killing anyone under the age of eighteen. 
  
  
    BREAK THE RULES, BECOME THE TARGET 
  
  Since the age of eighteen, Joseph has been assassinating people on behalf of a cause that he believes in but doesn't fully understand. The War is ageless, hidden in the shadows, governed by a rigid set of rules, and fought by two distinct sides-one good, one evil. The only unknown is which side is which. Soldiers in the War hide in plain sight, their deeds disguised as accidents or random acts of violence amidst an unsuspecting population ignorant of the brutality that is always inches away.
  Killing people is the only life Joseph has ever known, and he's one of the best at it. But when a job goes wrong and he's sent away to complete a punishingly dangerous assignment, Joseph meets a girl named Maria, and for the first time in his life his singleminded, bloody purpose fades away.
  Before Maria, Joseph's only responsibility was dealing death to the anonymous targets fingered by his superiors. Now he must run from the people who have fought by his side to save what he loves most in this world. As Children of Paranoia reaches its heart-in-throat climax, Joseph will learn that only one rule remains immutable: the only thing more dangerous than fighting the War...is leaving it.

Trezza Azzopardi,The Hiding Place,,English,,"A finalist for the prestigious Man Booker Prize, The Hiding Place -- Welsh novelist Trezza Azzopardi's lyrical tale of an immigrant family in Cardiff -- has been compared to Frank McCourt's bleak, stirring memoir Angela's Ashes. But The Hiding Place need not ""hide"" behind any ready-made comparisons; Azzopardi's astonishing, tension-filled debut stands assuredly on its own as a work of tremendous power and originality. The Hiding Place is narrated by Dolores, the youngest of six daughters born to a Maltese immigrant father and a Welsh mother. With one hand permanently disfigured by a fire when she was only one month old -- the hand is beautifully described by the author as ""a closed white tulip standing in the rain; a cutoff creamy marble in the shape of a Saint; a church candle with its tears flowing down the bulb of wrist"" -- Dolores has always been treated as an outcast. Her father, Frankie Gauci, is an incorrigible gambler who bets ""more than he can afford to lose."" On the day Dolores is born, he loses his half-share of a caf&eacute, as well as the apartment above it where his family lives. Everything in Frankie's life is potential currency, including his family; he even sells his second-oldest daughter Marina to gangster Joe Medora in exchange for a house and money to pay off his debts. Dolores's mother, Mary, is driven to the edge of insanity as she watches the world around her collapse, helpless to save even her children from her husband's vices. At times, The Hiding Place paints a phantasmagoric portrait of cruelty, but Trezza Azzopardi's gracefully exacting prose saves her tale from becoming a shock-fest of the sort you would expect on daytime television talk shows. Azzopardi forges profundity through delicately interwoven double-sided images: rabbits that are the children's playthings, until they are brutally slaughtered by their father; trunks, rooms, and cages that can either protect or ensnare; and most abundantly and most significantly, fire, which can warm as well as ravage. Even Dolores's older sister Fran is sent away to a home for being a pyromaniac, craving risk like her father, ""gambling on how hot, how high, on how long she can bear it."" While some readers may wonder how Dolores is able to relate events that happened when she was so young, it is easy to associate these stories with the phantom pains she feels in her missing fingers, her ability to ""miss something [she] never knew."" The story comes to us in a dreamlike tapestry, weaving together different times and perspectives. Consequently, the narrative is fragmented, leaving the reader with half-tellings, missing details, stories that unfold only in the retelling, and a sense that the only fact we can be certain of is the profound meaning she imparts through them. The Hiding Place is as much a portrait of a family's destruction as it is an exploration of how memory bends and buckles under the weight of ruin, and how ""blame can be twisted like a flame in draught; it will burn and burn.""",,,11/06/00,December 7th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Coming Of Age', 'Adult Fiction', 'Abuse', 'Adult', 'Drama', 'Family']",,9780802138590,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428510243l/268016.jpg,3.54,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2000)', 'Orange Prize Nominee for Longlist (2001)', 'Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2000)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (2000)', 'Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize (2001)']",91.0,1.0,,268016.The_Hiding_Place,,,,,85.0,1473.0,288,,Grove Press,"['278', '501', '477', '168', '49']",,,"['Cardiff, Wales (United Kingdom)']",,
Tri Wibowo,Gunung Makrifat : Memoar Para Pencari Tuhan,,,,"Novel ini lahir dari pengembaraan dan pengalaman di jalan tarekat sufi; dari perenungan dan dialog batin yang tak usai-usai–berkesudahan. Kisah dalam novel sufistik ini sederhana, namun penuh dengan perbincangan tentang hidup dan Tuhan, tentang keruhanian, perjalanan intelektual, dan pergolakan batin; juga dialog mengenai ajaran kesufian dari para syekh sufi agung seperti Muhyiddin Ibn ‘Arabi, Maulana Rumi, Syekh Manshur al-Hallaj, dan Syekh Fariduddin Atthar; serta tentang misteri mistis yang hadir dalam setiap perjalanan ruhani.Plotnya memang dibuat sederhana, agar pembaca lebih fokus pada muatan pemikiran dan lanskap batin, pada ‘rasa’ ruhani (zawq), yang tak kasat mata. Sang pendaki gunung, tokoh dalam novel ini, tak sekadar berkisah, namun ia mengajak pembacanya untuk melihat sisi lain dari duka dan kepedihan–tepatnya, sisi yang indah dari kesedihan di jalan spiritual, yang akan mengantarkan sang salik pada cinta dan pencerahan. Dalam pengembaraan dan perenungannya yang panjang dan menyakitkan, sang pendaki gunung pada akhirnya menyadari sebagian dari makna tersembunyi di balik ajaran tasawuf yang tampak anggun sekaligus samar dan gaib.

Tristan Egolf,Kornwolf,,English,,"Tristan Egolf's new novel is a book about the return of an old curse — the Kornwolf, a ferocious werewolf whose nocturnal rampaging becomes increasingly impossible to ignore. Kornwolf takes the reader for a good old-fashioned romp in the stubble — a journey through the slums and honky tundra of rural Pennsylvania, where nothing quite passes for good or bad, sublime or dismal, discrete or brash. And then the monotony breaks. Something — a freak of creation — is running amok in the fields. To solve the mystery, three generations of prodigal sons — a writer and hometown boy who swore he'd never come back to Penn's Woods; a middle-aged former pugilist who runs a decrepit boxing gym; and a misfit, mute, beaten-down Amish boy — are brought together by the light of a blue moon, in a town called Blue Ball. On one level this is a masterfully orchestrated, hilarious, and compelling take on the classic horror yarn, on another, Kornwolf is a social satire of suburban sprawl, closed minds, and all manners and varieties of self-satisfaction — Amish, civilian, or... other — in the best tradition of Tom Robbins and George Saunders.",,,11/06/05,November 29th 2005,['Owen Brynmore'],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Werewolves', 'Horror', 'American Fiction', 'Novels']",,9780802170163,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347258466l/24675.jpg,3.58,[],65.0,1.0,,24675.Kornwolf,,,,,85.0,468.0,400,,"Grove Press, Black Cat","['88', '181', '130', '52', '17']",,,['Pennsylvania (United States)'],,

Instead, Joel meets his morose stepmother, Amy, eccentric cousin Randolph, and a defiant little girl named Idabel, who soon offers Joel the love and approval he seeks.Fueled by a world-weariness that belied Capote’s tender age, this novel tempers its themes of waylaid hopes and lost innocence with an appreciation for small pleasures and the colorful language of its time and place.This new edition, featuring an enlightening Introduction by John Berendt, offers readers a fresh look at Capote’s emerging brilliance as a writer of protean power and effortless grace.From the Hardcover edition.",,,10/28/48,February 1st 1994,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Southern Gothic', 'Literature', 'LGBT', 'American', 'Gothic', 'Southern', 'Literary Fiction', '20th Century']",,9780679745648,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329028916l/2287.jpg,3.8,[],709.0,8.0,,2287.Other_Voices_Other_Rooms,,,,,91.0,12946.0,232,,Vintage,"['3430', '4800', '3580', '940', '196']",,,[],,

"Tucker Carlson (Author, Narrator)",Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution,,English,,"6 Hours and 32 MinutesThe popular FOX News star of Tucker Carlson Tonight offers his signature fearless and funny political commentary on how America’s ruling class has failed everyday Americans.“You look on in horror, helpless and desperate. You have nowhere to go. You’re trapped on a ship of fools.”—From the Introduction In Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution, Tucker Carlson tells the truth about the new American elites, a group whose power and wealth has grown beyond imagination even as the rest of the country has withered. The people who run America now barely interact with it. They fly on their own planes, ski on their own mountains, watch sporting events far from the stands in sky boxes. They have total contempt for you. “They view America the way a private equity firm sizes up an aging conglomerate,” Carlson writes, “as something outdated they can profit from. When it fails, they’re gone.” In Ship of Fools, Tucker Carlson offers a blistering critique of our new overlords. Traditional liberals are gone, he writes. The patchouli-scented hand-wringers who worried about whales and defended free speech have been replaced by globalists who hide their hard-edged economic agenda behind the smokescreen of identity politics. They’ll outsource your job while lecturing you about transgender bathrooms. Left and right, Carlson says, are no longer meaningful categories in America. “The rift is between those who benefit from the status quo, and those who don’t.” Our leaders are fools, Carlson concludes, “unaware that they are captains of a sinking ship.” But in the signature and witty style that viewers of Tucker Carlson Tonight have come to enjoy, his book answers the all-important question: How do we put the country back on course?",,,,October 2nd 2018,[],Audio CD,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Political Science', 'American History', 'American', 'Social Science', 'Economics', 'Adult']",,9781508246350,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1534693596l/35182973._SX318_.jpg,4.3,[],98.0,1.0,,35182973-ship-of-fools,,,,,95.0,4439.0,7,,Simon & Schuster Audio,"['2355', '1368', '499', '123', '94']",,,[],,

  The Book That Inspired The Movie
 My name is Tucker Max, and I am an asshole. I get excessively drunk at inappropriate times, disregard social norms, indulge every whim, ignore the consequences of my actions, mock idiots and posers, sleep with more women than is safe or reasonable, and just generally act like a raging dickhead. But, I do contribute to humanity in one very important way: I share my adventures with the world. from the IntroductionActual reader feedback:  ""I find it truly appalling that there are people in the world like you. You are a disgusting, vile, repulsive, repugnant, foul creature. Because of you, I don't believe in God anymore. No just God would allow someone like you to exist."" ""I'll stay with God as my lord, but you are my savior. I just finished reading your brilliant stories, and I laughed so hard I almost vomited. I want to bring that kind of joy to people. You're an artist of the highest order and a true humanitarian to boot. I'm in both shock and awe at how much I want to be you.""

Tupelo Hassman (Goodreads Author),Girlchild,,English,,"Rory Hendrix is the least likely of Girl Scouts. She hasn’t got a troop or even a badge to call her own.  But she’s checked the Handbook out from the elementary school library so many times that her name fills all the lines on the card, and she pores over its surreal advice (Disposal of Outgrown Uniforms; The Right Use of Your Body; Finding Your Way When Lost) for tips to get off the Calle:  that is, Calle de los Flores, the Reno trailer park where she lives with her mother, Jo, the sweet-faced, hard-luck bartender at the Truck Stop.Rory’s been told she is “third generation in a line of apparent imbeciles, feeble-minded bastards surely on the road to whoredom.” But she’s determined to prove the County and her own family wrong. Brash, sassy, vulnerable, wise, and terrified, she struggles with her mother’s habit of trusting the wrong men, and the mixed blessing of being too smart for her own good. From diary entries, social worker’s reports, half-recalled memories, story problems, arrest records, family lore, Supreme Court opinions, and her grandmother’s letters, Rory crafts a devastating collage that shows us her world while she searches for the way out of it.

"Tyler Hamilton, Daniel Coyle (Goodreads Author)","The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs",,English,,"The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cycling—and the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong—by former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle.Over the course of two years, Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anything—and take any risk, physical, mental, or moral—to gain the edge they need to win.Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world’s best-liked and top-ranked cyclists—a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stages—and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrong’s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrong’s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by Armstrong’s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacle—winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics—his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.From the exhilaration of his early, naïve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sport’s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong.A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, The Secret Race is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.",,,09/01/12,September 5th 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Cycling', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult']",,9780345530417,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344963275l/15823426.jpg,4.35,"['William Hill Sports Book of the Year (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)']",98.0,1.0,,15823426-the-secret-race,,,,,98.0,14442.0,290,,Bantam,"['7115', '5676', '1381', '169', '101']",,,[],,

Téa Obreht (Goodreads Author),The Tiger's Wife,,English,,"Weaving a brilliant latticework of family legend, loss, and love, Téa Obreht, the youngest of The New Yorker’s twenty best American fiction writers under forty, has spun a timeless novel that will establish her as one of the most vibrant, original authors of her generation.In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zóra begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather’s recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel. Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather’s final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with “the deathless man,” a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. “These stories,” Natalia comes to understand, “run like secret rivers through all the other stories” of her grandfather’s life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.",,,,March 8th 2011,['Natalia Stefanovic'],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Literary Fiction', 'Book Club', 'War', 'Contemporary', 'Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction']",,9780385343831,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382570044l/8366402.jpg,3.4,"['Orange Prize for Fiction (2011)', 'Internationaler Literaturpreis – Haus der Kulturen der Welt Nominee (2012)', 'Indies Choice Book Award for Adult Debut (2012)', 'NAIBA Book of the Year for Fiction (2011)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2012)', '本屋大賞 for Translated Fiction (2013)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (2011)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2011)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee (2013)', 'Metų verstinė knyga Nominee (2012)']",986.0,13.0,,8366402-the-tiger-s-wife,,,,,81.0,90521.0,338,,Random House,"['14718', '29323', '29061', '12625', '4794']",,,['Balkans'],,

"Tōson Shimazaki, William E. Naff (Translator)",Before the Dawn,,,,"Although Before the Dawn is the story of the author's family and of the Meiji restoration, it is much more than that; the aftermath of the events that form its context have fundamentally altered the nature of the world we live in. Its author was a man of sophistication and erudition even though he was not given to virtuoso displays of either quality. He created this novel out of his personal and artistic needs, and out of his sense of the need of Japan and the world community to know the story he tells in it. Japan has been richly served by the original. But Toson had a worldwide as well as a Japanese audience in mind when he wrote Before the Dawn. This translation has been done in the hope of contributing to that undertaking.Before the Dawn looks back on the adventure, turmoil, and tragedy of the mid-nineteenth century with a clear and unsentimental vision, but it speaks of those times in tones of tact, humility, and deference. It is a celebration of the humanity of its characters and the richness, complexity, and diversity of the lives they lived during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate and the first two decades of the Meiji era. For all the weight of its historical concerns, it maintains its lyrical tone even when the subject is external threat, internal political turmoil, the grinding hardship of maintaining the old post system, or the bitter disappointments that the new age brought so many of those who had worked hardest and sacrificed most to bring it into being. It has been followed not only by scholarly studies but also by an immense outpouring of historical fiction, family and local histories, and other publications drawing on the rich store of old diaries and official records preserved throughout the country. These later works often illuminate the period from points of view that were not accessible to any of Toson's characters, but Before the Dawn remains the standard against which all others are measured. --from the Introduction",,,April 1929,July 1st 1988,[],Paperback,"['Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction']",,9780824811648,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347592600l/335940.jpg,4.07,[],18.0,1.0,,335940.Before_the_Dawn,,,,,98.0,43.0,816,,University of Hawaii Press,"['16', '15', '11', '1', '0']",,,[],,
