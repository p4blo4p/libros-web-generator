1861: The Civil War Awakening,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Civil War', 'American History', 'War', 'American Civil War', 'Historical', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Law']","As the United States marks the 150th anniversary of our defining national drama, 1861 presents a gripping and original account of how the Civil War began.1861 is an epic of courage and heroism beyond the battlefields. Early in that fateful year, a second American revolution unfolded, inspiring a new generation to reject their parents’ faith in compromise and appeasement, to do the unthinkable in the name of an ideal. It set Abraham Lincoln on the path to greatness and millions of slaves on the road to freedom.The book introduces us to a heretofore little-known cast of Civil War heroes—among them an acrobatic militia colonel, an explorer’s wife, an idealistic band of German immigrants, a regiment of New York City firemen, a community of Virginia slaves, and a young college professor who would one day become president.

1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'American History', 'World History', 'Anthropology', 'Historical', 'Economics', 'Audiobook', 'Environment']","From the author of 1491—the best-selling study of the pre-Columbian Americas—a deeply engaging new history of the most momentous biological event since the death of the dinosaurs. More than 200 million years ago, geological forces split apart the continents. Isolated from each other, the two halves of the world developed radically different suites of plants and animals. When Christopher Columbus set foot in the Americas, he ended that separation at a stroke. Driven by the economic goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new homes across the oceans. The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is the reason there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland, and chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures the colonists knew nothing about hitched along for the ride. Earthworms, mosquitoes, and cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions, and African grasses; bacteria, fungi, and viruses; rats of every description—all of them rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like before, changing lives and landscapes across the planet. Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, silver from the Americas, mined by African and Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the first time that goods and people from every corner of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served created a new world economically.As Charles C. Mann shows, the Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent human history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological and economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated imperial China, convulsed Africa, and for two centuries made Mexico City—where Asia, Europe, and the new frontier of the Americas dynamically interacted—the center of the world. In such encounters, he uncovers the germ of today’s fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy to culture wars.In 1493, Charles Mann gives us an eye-opening scientific interpretation of our past, unequaled in its authority and fascination",,,,August 9th 2011,[],Hardcover,,9780307265722,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327900945l/9862761.jpg,4.1,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)'],267.0,4.0,,,,94.0,16016.0,557,Alfred A.

Mann radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in 1492.Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school, the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather, there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man’s first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.We all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.",,,,March 11th 2014,[],Hardcover,,9780062265425,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451446393l/18505796.jpg,3.92,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2014)'],174.0,2.0,,,,91.0,80582.0,256,It Books,"['26140', '31426', '15963', '4560', '2493']",,[],,['Dan Harris']

It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.

He's been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don't: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that only the undead can.Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little afraid, but the fed made it plain that there is only one way out.

1st to Die,,Fiction,"Four crime-solving friends face off against a killer in San Francisco in the Women's Murder Club novel that started James Patterson's thrilling series. Each one holds a piece of the puzzle: Lindsay Boxer is a homicide inspector in the San Francisco Police Department, Claire Washburn is a medical examiner, Jill Bernhardt is an assistant D.A., and Cindy Thomas just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle. But the usual procedures aren't bringing them any closer to stopping the killings. So these women form a Women's Murder Club to collaborate outside the box and pursue the case by sidestepping their bosses and giving each other a hand. The four women develop intense bonds as they pursue a killer whose crimes have stunned an entire city. Working together, they track down the most terrifying and unexpected killer they have ever encountered--before a shocking conclusion in which everything they knew turns out to be devastatingly wrong.

1st to Die,,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Murder Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Detective', 'Adult']","James Patterson, bestselling author of the Alex Cross novels Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, and Pop Goes the Weasel, offers the first of a new series dubbed The Women's Murder Club, featuring a four-woman team that occasionally works outside the system. None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.--Tom Piccirilli",Women's Murder Club #1,,03/05/01,May 20th 2005,"['Lindsay Boxer', 'Claire Washburn', 'Jill Bernhardt', 'Cindy Thomas', 'Warren Jacobi']",Paperback,,9780446696616,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522906581l/13137._SY475_.jpg,4.08,[],818.0,12.0,,,,94.0,296188.0,424,Grand Central Publishing,"['121017', '101106', '56399', '12036', '5630']",,"['San Francisco, California (United States)']",,['James Patterson']

102 Minutes: The Untold Story of the Fight to Survive Inside the Twin Towers,,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'American History', 'True Crime', 'Terrorism', 'Biography', 'Survival', 'Historical', 'War', 'Politics']","The dramatic and moving account of the struggle for life inside the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, when every minute countedAt 8:46 am on September 11, 2001, 14,000 people were inside the twin towers-reading e-mails, making trades, eating croissants at Windows on the World. Over the next 102 minutes, each would become part of a drama for the ages, one witnessed only by the people who lived it-until now. Of the millions of words written about this wrenching day, most were told from the outside looking in. New York Times reporters Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have taken the opposite-and far more revealing-approach. Reported from the perspectives of those inside the towers, 102 Minutes captures the little-known stories of ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to save themselves and others. Beyond this stirring panorama stands investigative reporting of the first rank. An astounding number of people actually survived the plane impacts but were unable to escape, and the authors raise hard questions about building safety and tragic flaws in New York's emergency preparedness.Dwyer and Flynn rely on hundreds of interviews with rescuers, thousands of pages of oral histories, and countless phone, e-mail, and emergency radio transcripts. They cross a bridge of voices to go inside the infernos, seeing cataclysm and heroism, one person at a time, to tell the affecting, authoritative saga of the men and women-the nearly 12,000 who escaped and the 2,749 who perished-as they made 102 minutes count as never before.

100 Common Sense Policies to make BRITAIN GREAT again,,['Politics'],"Our way of life is under threat from a hidden enemy, and the people who are trying to destroy our country never take a day off, so if we hope to make BRITAIN GREAT again, neither should you or I.People in this country are getting angry, and in this book I analyse their views and justify them in the words of the bloke who goes to football on a Saturday afternoon, enjoys a few pints with his mates before the game and puts the world to rights.I haven’t watered any of my Policies down, or bent them to suit the do-gooders, I promise you that. What I have done, however, is put full integrity into the writing of this book. You, like me, may feel something needs to be done about the following issues;•	Grooming Gangs•	Terrorist Activity•	Extremism•	Female Genital Mutilation•	Modern Slavery•	Acid Attacks•	Immigration – respect for the home nation•	Immigration – get a job!•	Racism•	Stop ‘n’ Search – Knife Crime•	Refugees •	Burglary•	The Windrush Generation•	Education•	The NHS•	Benefit Cheats•	Ex-Servicemen Sleeping Rough•	Bullies•	Religion•	The Union JackI’ve no doubt there will be people who disagree with my Policies, and that’s okay. We’re not all supposed to agree. But there are issues right now that need addressing. We read about them in the papers, we listen to radio hosts discuss them on phone-in programmes and we talk about them to our mates at work and in the pub. I also speak to a lot of football supporters from various clubs and I know most are in accordance with my views.I am deadly serious that if the majority of the Policies I propose here were adopted, Great Britain would be a safer place to live and, of course, GREAT again. And isn’t this what we all want? A safer place for our children and our grandchildren?From time to time I tend to get a little frustrated in the book, and if my language upsets you then I apologise, but far better you read it with full emotion than a half-hearted attempt to hold myself in check.

1970s Bollywood: The 50 Must See Hindi Movies,,[],"Bollywood in the 1970’s stands out because it was the true dawn of modern Indian cinema. Unlike the decades that came before and after it, the seventies straddled the cultures of the East and the West and made it just perfect for the palates of both sides. Although suspense and action films dominated, drama and romance were not neglected. In other words Hindi movies from this decade have something for everyone to enjoy. Wet saris in the rain. Bikinis at the beach. Pre-marital sex. Arranged marriages. Youth rebelling against their parents. Heroes who wronged their heroines. Heroes who didn’t. Heroines who were the vamps. Heroines who were self-sacrificing saints. Vicious outlaw villains in the mountains. White collar office worker crooks. Funky R&B beats fused with Indian sounds. Traditional dancing with a veil. Striptease dancing with hot pants. You name it. The writer who was weaned on Indian movies and Indian food had her first Bollywood experience on the big screen before she started school. This book, 1970’s Bollywood: The 50 Must See Hindi Movies lists the crème de la crème of the decade. The 1970’s boast the biggest, most influential and legendary stars of Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Hema Malini, Zeenat Aman, Dharmendra, Rekha, Shashi Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and more all became superstars during this time.

But in today's accelerated world, with its competing priorities, information overload, and confounding options, we can easily find ourselves steered by impulse, stress, or expedience. Are our decisions the right ones? Or are we being governed, time and time again, and against our best intentions, by the demands of the moment? A transformative new approach to decision making, 10-10-10 is a tool for reclaiming your life at home, in love, and at work. The process is clear, straightforward, and transparent.

Whether it is used by college students or busy mothers or senior business executives, artists, government administrators, or entrepreneurs, 10-10-10 has shown its effectiveness in decisions large and small, routine and radical, consistently changing lives for the better.
