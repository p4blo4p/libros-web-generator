Esther Freud,Hideous Kinky,,,,"The debut novel from the author of Summer at Gaglow, called ""a near-seamless meshing of family feeling, history and imagination"" by the New York Times Book Review. Escaping gray London in 1972, a beautiful, determined mother takes her daughters, aged 5 and 7, to Morocco in search of adventure, a better life, and maybe love. Hideous Kinky follows two little English girls -- the five-year-old narrator and Bea, her seven-year-old sister -- as they struggle to establish some semblance of normal life on a trip to Morocco with their hippie mother, Julia. Once in Marrakech, Julia immerses herself in Sufism and her quest for personal fulfillment, while her daughters rebel -- the older by trying to recreate her English life, the younger by turning her hopes for a father on a most unlikely candidate.

Eudora Welty,One Writer's Beginnings,,English,,"Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance.

Eufrain McPoonin,Thrown Away: the Walking Papers,,English,,"In 1992, Jeffrey McPoe plummets below the 40-50 feet deep cliff with his car, one heart-pounding event ahead of his disaster. As the investigator himself, it turned the other way around; he has just become the interrogated guy and the embassy's object of investigation. As the probe tracks his frantic race toward proving his innocence, he is tormented by mad visions and by the knowledge that his time in the embassy is running out, determined to fight back for his vindication. Responding to little more than the primitive quest for justice at any cost, he retreats ever deeper into the cradle of his own government, one which never has eyes glowed bright green in the headlight, and bares no fangs to bite for his case. ""Thrown Away"" takes you on a journey of investigation and an avowed loyalty of one of the Consular Investigators of the U.S. Embassy of two and a half decades.",,Final Edition,12/19/13,June 4th 2014,[],Paperback,[],,9781499709476,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402112904l/22437126.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,22437126-thrown-away,,,,,100.0,1.0,122,,Onofre M.

"Eugene B. Sledge, Paul Fussell (Contributor)",With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,,English,,"In his own book, Wartime, Paul Fussell called With the Old Breed ""one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war."" John Keegan referred to it in The Second World War as ""one of the most arresting documents in war literature."" And Studs Terkel was so fascinated with the story he interviewed its author for his book, ""The Good War."" What has made E.B. Sledge's memoir of his experience fighting in the South Pacific during World War II so devastatingly powerful is its sheer honest simplicity and compassion.Now including a new introduction by Paul Fussell, With the Old Breed presents a stirring, personal account of the vitality and bravery of the Marines in the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa. Born in Mobile, Alabama in 1923 and raised on riding, hunting, fishing, and a respect for history and legendary heroes such as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene Bondurant Sledge (later called ""Sledgehammer"" by his Marine Corps buddies) joined the Marines the year after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and from 1943 to 1946 endured the events recorded in this book. In those years, he passed, often painfully, from innocence to experience.Sledge enlisted out of patriotism, idealism, and youthful courage, but once he landed on the beach at Peleliu, it was purely a struggle for survival. Based on the notes he kept on slips of paper tucked secretly away in his New Testament, he simply and directly recalls those long months, mincing no words and sparing no pain. The reality of battle meant unbearable heat, deafening gunfire, unimaginable brutality and cruelty, the stench of death, and, above all, constant fear. Sledge still has nightmares about ""the bloody, muddy month of May on Okinawa."" But, as he also tellingly reveals, the bonds of friendship formed then will never be severed.Sledge's honesty and compassion for the other marines, even complete strangers, sets him apart as a memoirist of war. Read as sobering history or as high adventure, With the Old Breed is a moving chronicle of action and courage.",,,11/28/81,October 25th 1990,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'World War II', 'Military History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'American History']",,9780195067149,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297640051l/771332.jpg,4.44,[],633.0,7.0,,771332.With_the_Old_Breed,,,,,97.0,28805.0,326,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['17109', '8419', '2533', '473', '271']",,,[],,

Sledge continues his story where With the Old Breed left off and recounts the compelling conclusion of his Marine career.After Japan's surrender in 1945, Sledge and his company were sent to China to maintain order and to calm the seething cauldron of political and ideological unrest created by opposing factions. His regiment was the first Marine unit to return to the ancient city of Peiping (now Beijing) where they witnessed the last of old China and the rise of the Communist state. Sledge also recounts the difficulty of returning to his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, and resuming civilian life while haunted by shadows of close combat. Through the discipline of writing and the study of biology, he shows how he came to terms with the terrifying memories that had plagued him for years.Poignant and compelling, China Marine provides a frank depiction of the real costs of war, emotional and psychological as well as physical, and reveals the enduring bond that develops between men who face the horrors of war.",,,05/30/02,July 1st 2003,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'China', 'Autobiography']",,9780195167764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428794437l/421398.jpg,4.22,[],99.0,1.0,,421398.China_Marine,,,,,97.0,854.0,167,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['396', '281', '154', '17', '6']",,,[],,

Eugene Rogan,"The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, 1914-1920",,English,,"In 1914 the Ottoman Empire was depleted of men and resources after years of war against Balkan nationalist and Italian forces. But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The Great War spelled the end of the Ottomans, unleashing powerful forces that would forever change the face of the Middle East.In The Fall of the Ottomans, award-winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region’s crucial role in the conflict. Bolstered by German money, arms, and military advisors, the Ottomans took on the Russian, British, and French forces, and tried to provoke Jihad against the Allies in their Muslim colonies. Unlike the static killing fields of the Western Front, the war in the Middle East was fast-moving and unpredictable, with the Turks inflicting decisive defeats on the Entente in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Gaza before the tide of battle turned in the Allies’ favor. The great cities of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and, finally, Damascus fell to invading armies before the Ottomans agreed to an armistice in 1918.The postwar settlement led to the partition of Ottoman lands between the victorious powers, and laid the groundwork for the ongoing conflicts that continue to plague the modern Arab world. A sweeping narrative of battles and political intrigue from Gallipoli to Arabia, The Fall of the Ottomans is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the Great War and the making of the modern Middle East.",,,,March 10th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War I', 'Politics', 'Military History', 'World History', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Islam']",,9780465023073,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426972194l/24481072.jpg,4.14,['MHM Book of the Year Nominee (2016)'],99.0,1.0,,24481072-the-fall-of-the-ottomans,,,,,97.0,2855.0,512,,Basic Books,"['1021', '1298', '460', '57', '19']",,,[],,

Eugenio Corti,The Red Horse,,English,,"Eugenio Corti A literary phenomenon in Italy, The Red Horse a European bast-seller, was voted the best Italian novel of the decade in a public survey. Its success had gone far beyond Italy, as the book has been translated into Spanish, French, Japanese and three other languages. This epic historical novel about World War II and after, written from the author's own personal experiences as an Italian Freedom Fighter, is a profoundly moving account of the war, those who fought in it on both sides, and the effects the war had on families in the author's hometown in Italy. On a wider scale, it is a faithful witness to the actual events of the war - including the role of historical personages who appear, the Russian campaign, the Nazi barbarism, the Communist gulag, the North Italian resistance, and political life in the two decades following the war. This world, filled with powerful personalities, drama and clashing armies, bathes in the light of the truth. What makes this truly historical novel, with its epic scope, a masterpiece is the underlying spiritual dimensions of the protagonist, his family and friends, which illuminates the ongoing tragedy of the war and its aftermath. In the end, it is a story of faith and hope in a world reduced to barbarism and cruelty. Born in 1921 in Lombardy, Eugenio Corti joined the Italian Freedom Fighters.

Euripides,Αλκηστισ,"African Americans, Jews, and American Popular Song",,Alcestis (Greek mythology),"Euripides of Athens (ca. 485-406 BC), famous in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations wrote nearly ninety plays. Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes. Alcestis is the story of a woman who agrees--in order to save her husband's life--to die in his place. Medea is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with Cyclops, a satyr play--the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction. In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides---parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art--cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves.

In Orestes, the most popular of the tragedian's plays in the ancient world, Euripides explores theemotional consequences of Orestes' murder of his mother on the individuals concerned, and makes the tale resonate with advice to Athens about the threat to democracy posed by political pressure groups. The Suppliant Women is a commentary on the politics of empire, as the Athenian king Theseusdecides to use force of arms rather than persuasion against Thebes.

Eva Brann,"The Ways of Naysaying: No, Not, Nothing, and Nonbeing",,English,,"No, that diminutive but independent vocable, begins its great role early in human life and never loses it. For not only can it head a negative sentence, announcing its judgement, or answer a question, implying its negated content, it can, and mostly does, in the beginning of speech, express an assertion of the resistant will-sometimes just that and nothing more. The adult antiphony to the toddler's incessant no is another no, that of preventive command, and the great commandments of later life continue to be prohibitions: Nine of the Ten Commandments are in the negative. Eva Brann explores nothingness in the third book of her trilogy, which has treated imagination, time and now naysaying.

It shapes entire civilizations and transforms the world, one individual at a time.  Yet, all too often we allow learning to become just a long succession of the three T s: texts, tests and tedium.  Have we lost touch with the wonders of human curiosity, ingenuity and creativity which will ultimately determine the success of our schools, our businesses and society?

Eva Márquez (Goodreads Author),Sweetest Taboo,,English,,"Isabel Cruz was fifteen years old when she met Tom Stevens. She was 15 when they started dating, and 16 when she lost her virginity to him. By the time she turned 18 and went to college, everything had fallen apart.This hadn’t been an ordinary love, though. Not a love between two dear friends, or even high school sweethearts. This had been the most taboo sort of love there was: a relationship between a student and her teacher. Isabel started her high school career as a normal student, but set her sights on Tom Stevens as soon as she met him, and pursued him with an intense – and sometimes reckless – fascination. When he finally approached her after swim practice and told her that he shared her feelings, it was the start of a forbidden and dangerous relationship.Join Isabel as she makes her way through this dark love story, hiding from teachers, lying to her parents, and defying the authorities to make a life with the man she loves. Watch as she discovers the wonders of love and romance, and the terrible betrayal of jealous friends. And cry with her when she learns the hard truth about life and the people in her world. Sweetest Taboo is inspired by the true and tragic stories of students who fall in love with their teachers, and live with the hard truths of forbidden romances. In a world full of after-school specials on sexual predators, this touching book seeks a different path, casting both student and teacher in a gentle light, and showing that true love may lie at the base of even the most illicit romance.",Sweetest Taboo #1,,09/18/12,October 1st 2012,[],Paperback,"['Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Coming Of Age', 'Drama', 'Teachers', 'New Adult', 'Love Story', 'Fiction']",,B009OKSNYC,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355597104l/15754577.jpg,3.4,[],98.0,1.0,,15754577-sweetest-taboo,,,,,78.0,489.0,295,,Terra-Mía Press,"['106', '135', '139', '65', '44']",,,[],,

Eva Schloss,After Auschwitz,,English,,"Eva was arrested by the Nazis on her fifteenth birthday and sent to Auschwitz. Her survival depended on endless strokes of luck, her own determination and the love and protection of her mother Fritzi, who was deported with her.When Auschwitz was liberated, Eva and Fritzi began the long journey home. They searched desperately for Eva's father and brother, from whom they had been separated. The news came some months later. Tragically, both men had been killed.Before the war, in Amsterdam, Eva had become friendly with a young girl called Anne Frank. Though their fates were very different, Eva's life was set to be entwined with her friend's for ever more, after her mother Fritzi married Anne's father Otto Frank in 1953.This is a searingly honest account of how an ordinary person survived the Holocaust. Eva's memories and descriptions are heartbreakingly clear, her account brings the horror as close as it can possibly be.But this is also an exploration of what happened next, of Eva's struggle to live with herself after the war and to continue the work of her step-father Otto, ensuring that the legacy of Anne Frank is never forgotten.",,,11/05/13,April 11th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'Memoir', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'Religion']",,9781444760682,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366276890l/17828703.jpg,4.35,[],75.0,1.0,,17828703-after-auschwitz,,,,,98.0,2567.0,336,,Hodder & Stoughton,"['1331', '867', '311', '41', '17']",,,[],,

Let the reader beware. This is a shocking book - not for its candor and daring but for its cruelty and scorn, its shattering impact, and its terrifying vision of reality. What begins as a vacation idyll gradually turns into a dark parable of modern society, revealing the insensate barbarity of man.The opening is as bright as summer, as calm as a cobra dozing in the sun. But, as summer and compassion wane, the author strips away the pretense of youth and lays bare the blunt, primeval urge to crush, defile, betray. The tragic, inevitable outcome exposes the depths of moral corruption and the violation of the soul.In this tale of depravity, Evan Hunter has written a novel that is a work of art.

Evan S. Connell,Son of the Morning Star: General Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn,,,,"On a scorching June Sunday in 1876, thousands of Indian warriors - Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho - converged on a grassy ridge above the valley of Montana's Little Bighorn River. On the ridge five companies of United States cavalry - 262 soldiers, comprising officers and troopers - fought desperately but hopelessly. When the guns fell silent, no soldier - including their commanding officer, Lt Col. George Armstrong Custer - had survived. Custer's Last Stand is among the most enduring events in American history - 130 years after the fact, books continue to be written and people continue to argue about even the most basic details surrounding the Little Bighorn. Evan S. Connell, whom Joyce Carol Oates has described as 'one of our most interesting and intelligent American writers', wrote what continues to be the most reliable - and compulsively readable - account of the subject.

He follows four men throughout: Admiral William (""Bull"") Halsey, the macho, gallant, racist American fleet commander; Admiral Takeo Kurita, the Japanese battleship commander charged with making what was, in essence, a suicidal fleet attack against the American invasion of the Philippines; Admiral Matome Ugaki, a self-styled samurai who was the commander of all kamikazes and himself the last kamikaze of the war; and Commander Ernest Evans, a Cherokee Indian and Annapolis graduate who led his destroyer on the last great charge in the last great naval battle in history.""Sea of Thunder"" climaxes with the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the biggest naval battle ever fought, over four bloody and harrowing days in October 1944. We see Halsey make an epic blunder just as he reaches for true glory; we see the Japanese navy literally sailing in circles, torn between the desire to die heroically and the exhausted, unacceptable realization that death is futile; we sail with Commander Evans and the men of the USS ""Johnston"" into the jaws of the Japanese fleet and exult and suffer with them as they torpedo a cruiser, bluff and confuse the enemy -- and then, their ship sunk, endure fifty horrific hours in shark-infested water.Thomas, a journalist and historian, traveled to Japan, where he interviewed veterans of the Imperial Japanese Navy who survived the Battle of Leyte Gulf and friends and family of the two Japanese admirals. From new documents and interviews, he was able to piece together and answer mysteries about the Battle of LeyteGulf that have puzzled historians for decades. He writes with a knowing feel for the clash of cultures.""Sea of Thunder"" is a taut, fast-paced, suspenseful narrative of the last great naval war, an important contribution to the history of the Second World War.",,,11/01/06,November 7th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'Naval History', 'Japan', 'American History', 'Biography']",,9780743252218,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388265335l/37623.jpg,4.12,['Theodore And Franklin D.

Evan Wright (Goodreads Author),"Generation Kill: Devil Dogs, Iceman, Captain America, and the New Face of American War",,English,,"
  Another nameless town, another target for First Recon. It's only five in the afternoon, but a sandtorm has plunged everything into a hellish twilight of murky, red dust. On rooftops, in alleyways lurk militiamen with machine guns, AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade. Artillery bombardment has shattered the town's sewers and rubble is piled up in lagoons of human excrement. It stinks. Welcome to Iraq...
Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam. They were a new breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears-soldiers raised on hip hop, Internet porn, Marilyn Manson, video games and The Real World, a band of born-again Christians, dopers, Buddhists, and New Agers who gleaned their precepts from kung fu movies and Oprah Winfrey. Cocky, brave, headstrong, wary, and mostly unprepared for the physical, emotional, and moral horrors ahead, the ""First Suicide Battalion"" would spearhead the blitzkrieg on Iraq, and fight against the hardest resistance Saddam had to offer.

Eve Ensler,The Good Body,,English,,"Botox, bulimia, breast implants: Eve Ensler, author of the international sensation The Vagina Monologues, is back, this time to rock our view of what it means to have a “good body.” “In the 1950s,” Eve writes, girls were “pretty, perky. They had a blond Clairol wave in their hair. They wore girdles and waist-pinchers. . . . In recent years good girls join the army. They climb the corporate ladder. They go to the gym. . . . They wear painful pointy shoes. They don’t eat too much. They . . . don’t eat at all. They stay perfect. They stay thin. I could never be good.”The Good Body starts with Eve’s tortured relationship with her own “post-forties” stomach and her skirmishes with everything from Ab Rollers to fad diets and fascistic trainers in an attempt get the “flabby badness” out. As Eve hungrily seeks self-acceptance, she is joined by the voices of women from L.A. to Kabul, whose obsessions are also laid bare: A young Latina candidly critiques her humiliating “spread,” a stubborn layer of fat that she calls “a second pair of thighs.” The wife of a plastic surgeon recounts being systematically reconstructed–inch by inch–by her “perfectionist” husband. An aging magazine executive, still haunted by her mother’s long-ago criticism, describes her desperate pursuit of youth as she relentlessly does sit-ups.Along the way, Eve also introduces us to women who have found a hard-won peace with their bodies: an African mother who celebrates each individual body as signs of nature’s diversity; an Indian woman who transcends “treadmill mania” and delights in her plump cheeks and curves; and a veiled Afghani woman who is willing to risk imprisonment for a taste of ice cream. These are just a few of the inspiring stories woven through Eve’s global journey from obsession to enlightenment. Ultimately, these monologues become a personal wake-up call from Eve to love the “good bodies” we inhabit.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/01/04,November 9th 2004,[],Hardcover,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Plays', 'Womens', 'Drama', 'Gender Studies', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Womens Studies', 'Theatre']",,9780375502842,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428178281l/531495.jpg,3.67,[],61.0,1.0,,531495.The_Good_Body,,,,,86.0,2076.0,112,,Villard,"['545', '668', '570', '226', '67']",,,[],,
Eve Ensler,I am an Emotional Creature,,English,,"In this daring, provocative, and insightful book, bestselling author and internationally acclaimed playwright Eve Ensler writes fictional monologues and stories inspired by girls around the globe. Moving through a world of topics and emotions, these voices are fierce, alive, tender, complicated, imaginative, and smart. Girls today often find themselves in a struggle between remaining strong and true to themselves and conforming to society’s expectations in an attempt to please. They are taught not to be too intense, too passionate, too smart, too caring, too open. They are encouraged to shut down their instincts, their outrage, their desires and their dreams, to be polite, to obey the rules. I Am an Emotional Creature is a celebration of the authentic voice inside every girl and an inspiring call to action for girls everywhere to speak up, follow their dreams, and become the women they were always meant to be.Among the girls Ensler creates are an American who struggles with peer pressure in a suburban high school; an anorexic blogging as she eats less and less; a Masai girl from Kenya unwilling to endure female genital mutilation; a Bulgarian sex slave, no more than fifteen, a Chinese factory worker making Barbies; an Iranian student who is tricked into a nose job; a pregnant girl trying to decide if she should keep her baby.Through rants, poetry, questions, and facts, we come to understand the universality of girls everywhere: their resiliency, their wildness, their pain, their fears, their secrets, and their triumphs.

Eve Forward,Villains by Necessity,,English,,"With the banishment of Evil from the realms, the final victory of Good is assured-unless a few stalwart antiheroes can save the world from a serious and potentially fatal imbalance. First novelist Forward explores the complications that arise from a surfeit of ""goodness"" in the world. The result is a skewed version of the epic fantasy that features an assassin, a thief, an evil sorceress, a dark knight, and an implacable druid as the villains-turned-heroes who must restore the delicate balance of opposing forces before their world disappears in a blinding flash of Goodness and Light. -- Library JournalForward's first novel gives the concept of the balance between good and evil a most ingenious twist: What if good were so totally triumphant that it became a worse danger than evil, and a band of unemployed evil characters had to go on a desperate quest to find the means of putting the saving bit of evil back into the world? The result of this twist is an almost straightforward quest tale, with numerous well-drawn characters (including a centaur who starts off as a secret agent for good and eventually joins the side of evil), great ingenuity about magic, very creditable world-building, and considerable wit. Although bearing its share of first-novel flaws, it has many more virtues, which include an underlying, serious examination of the good-evil dichotomy that is the basis of so many role-playing games. -- Roland Green",,,10/29/95,March 1st 1996,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Adventure', 'High Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Adult', 'Unfinished']",,9780812522280,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335913626l/401454.jpg,4.19,[],198.0,2.0,,401454.Villains_by_Necessity,,,,,93.0,1559.0,544,,Tom Doherty Assoc Llc,"['772', '448', '234', '66', '39']",,,[],,

Miss Margaret has been the Methodist church organist for almost 40 years and she truly loves the pipe organ she plays. In addition to valuing the tangible instrument, there is a deeper, more ethereal component to this situation. Miss Margaret uses the organ as a means of expression, one in which she pours her heart and soul into. After so many years of joined experience, she feels the organ actually contains a piece of her. Playing the old pipe organ has been a consistent source of joy the entire time she’s been the organist. Her beloved church has fallen into disrepair from years of haphazard neglect and a sect in the church advocates reconstruction using state of the art materials and technology. A rift forms between the church members who want to repair the church to its original state and the progressive sect who want to modernize as renovations take place. Decisions reach a crescendo when it is discovered that Miss Margaret’s cherished pipe organ needs complete restoration. It appears that progressive attitudes will prevail over the traditional frame of reference that the people in the town have historically lived by. Miss Margaret becomes painfully aware that times have changed while she seems to have been standing still.

You: a) Wish them luck, and walk away with your head held high (because that’s what society expects you to do)? b) Quietly seethe, but accept that there is just nothing you can do about it (because it easier for everyone if you do nothing)? c) Dig up dirt on the bitch (because someone like this would undoubtedly have dirt), use it to sabotage their relationship, then sit back with a glass of Pinot Grigio and watch them burn? Answer: C. Oh, totally C. ******Meet Scarlett Smyth. She’s drop-dead gorgeous, has a rocking body and has an above average IQ. She brags that she can ensnare any husband or taken male, and …she often does. She also is ambitious and has a penchant for anything expensive. When the shrewd and ambitious temptress lays eyes on Bradley Murdoch, she believes she has found her dream man and a ticket to the high life she’s entitled to. There are just two problems: 1) Bradley is married to Rival. Happily at that. 2) They have children. Adorable little girls. Do those facts deter Scarlett in any way? No, not at all. She is determined to steal Bradley, smoothly replace Rival in his life and show him how to really live life. In a calculating move, the seductress (she is so good at seduction, she is even penning a book on it) befriends the quiet and unassuming Rival and worms her way into Bradley’s life. There’s more: To expedite things, Scarlett the mistress, engineers a way to wipe Rival out of the picture - sends the clueless wife on a “vacation”. But Scarlett may have underestimated her opponent. When Rival realizes the extent of the betrayal, she decides, even though she lacks Scarlett’s genius IQ, not to turn the other cheek. In fact, she is determined to win back her husband, believing that he is a good man who is simply mistaking lust for love. She believes that someone like Scarlett has to have skeletons in her cupboards and she begins to snoop around, anything she can use against the other woman, anything that can help her exact revenge.What Rival doesn’t realize is: no one crosses Scarlett and gets away with it.

"Evelyn M. Monahan, Rosemary Neidel-Greenlee",And If I Perish: Frontline U.S. Army Nurses in World War II,,English,,"In World War II, 59,000 women voluntarily risked their lives for their country as U.S. Army nurses. When the war began, some of them had so little idea of what to expect that they packed party dresses; but the reality of service quickly caught up with them, whether they waded through the water in the historic landings on North African and Normandy beaches, or worked around the clock in hospital tents on the Italian front as bombs fell all around them. For more than half a century these women's experiences remained untold, almost without reference in books, historical societies, or military archives. After years of reasearch and hundreds of hours of interviews, Evelyn M. Monahan and Rosemary Neidel-Greenlee have created a dramatic narrative that at last brings to light the critical role that women played throughout the war. From the North African and Italian Campaigns to the Liberation of France and the Conquest of Germany, U.S. Army nurses rose to the demands of war on the frontlines with grit, humor, and great heroism.

Evelyn Waugh,The Complete Stories of Evelyn Waugh,,,Fiction,"A ""lavishly entertaining"" (Publishers Weekly) distillation of Waugh's genius--abundant evidence that one of the twentieth century's most admired and enjoyed English novelists was also a master of the short form. Evelyn Waugh's short fiction reveals in miniaturized perfection the elements that made him the greatest satirist of the twentieth century. The stories collected here range from delightfully barbed portraits of the British upper classes to an alternative ending to Waugh's novel A Handful of Dust; from a ""missing chapter"" in the life of Charles Ryder, the nostalgic hero of Brideshead Revisited, to a plot-packed morality tale that Waugh composed at a very tender age; from an epistolary lark in the voice of ""a young lady of leisure"" to a darkly comic tale of scandal in a remote (and imaginary) African outpost.",,,,2000.0,,,,0316926604,9780316926607,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HeLt9TIQx5UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,640.0,,,,743.0,,,,
Evelyn Waugh,The Sword of Honour Trilogy,,,Fiction,"(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) This trilogy of novels about World War II, largely based on his own experiences as an army officer, is the crowning achievement of Evelyn Waugh’s career. Its central character is Guy Crouchback, head of an ancient but decayed Catholic family, who at first discovers new purpose in the challenge to defend Christian values against Nazi barbarism, but then gradually finds the complexities and cruelties of war too much for him. Yet, though often somber, the Sword of Honour trilogy is also a brilliant comedy, peopled by the fantastic figures so familiar from Waugh’s early satires. The deepest pleasures these novels afford come from observing a great satiric writer employ his gifts with extraordinary subtlety, delicacy, and human feeling, for purposes that are ultimately anything but satiric.",,,,1994.0,,,,0679431365,9780679431367,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kSQCAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.24,,,,,,,,,,,,711.0,,,,1068.0,,,,

On both levels it's a superlatively well done book.” —Chicago Tribune Evelyn Waugh, author of the internationally acclaimed bestseller Brideshead Revisited and one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, considered Helena to be perhaps his finest novel.

Here he provides a “hindsight” glimpse into his unbelievable life, revealing his story of transformation: from almost complete disability (caused by cerebral palsy at birth) to a lifetime of fulfillment and self-realization. As Eyal often advises, “if I can do it, so can you!”At the age of 24, after enduring years of self pity, needy reliance on others, insecurity, and a strong belief that his life is just a product of one case of very bad luck, Eyal found another way to live. On this new path, which he calls “From Disable to Able,” Eyal has learned how to use the seemingly magical power of the subconscious, positive thinking, and imagination; all of which opened the door to a brand new world: one in which he retook control over his choices and actions in life. Eyal now leads a life enriched by taking practical and responsible actions. He says he has never felt happier, stronger, or more whole. Through a deep inner perspective, enhanced by a light and humoristic approach to life in the face of hardships, in this book Eyal provides you with a set of practical tools that allow you to go from a “fixation state-of-mind” to spiritual, mental and physical prosperity and freedom. Ask yourself the following questions:Are you happy?Is there love in your life?Do you feel content with what you do?Are you satisfied with your employment situation?Do you just make ends meet each month?Are you appreciated where you work?Are you aware of the huge potential that lies within you?Do you believe that your future is predetermined and cannot be changed?This book is for you if you’re ready to change your mindset, and delve into new and exciting life’s adventures.

Imprisoned for some weeks in a wire cage open to the elements, Pound suffered a nervous collapse from the physical and emotional strain. Out of the agony of his own inferno came the eleven cantos that became the sixth book of his modernist epic, The Cantos, themselves conceived as a Divine Comedy for our time. The Pisan Cantos were published in 1948 by New Directions and in the following year were awarded the Bollingen Prize for poetry by the Library of Congress. The honor came amid violent controversy, for the dark cloud of treason still hung over Pound, incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Yet there is no doubt that The Pisan Cantos displays some of his finest and most affecting writing, marking an elegaic turn to the personal while synthesizing the philosophical and economic political themes of his previous cantos.

"Eça de Queirós, Carlos Reis (Introdução)",A Cidade e as Serras,,Portuguese,,"Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #5José Maria de Eça de Queiroz (Póvoa de Varzim, 25 de novembro de 1845 — Neuilly-sur-Seine, 16 de agosto de 1900), escritor e ensaísta, foi um dos nomes mais importantes da literatura portuguesa. De nome completo José Maria de Eça de Queirós nasceu a Novembro de 1845, numa casa na Praça do Almada, em Póvoa de Varzim. O seu pai, José Maria de Almeida de Teixeira de Queirós, nascido no Brasil e vindo para Portugal com um ano de idade, provinha de uma família de magistrados perseguidos pelos seus ideais liberais que defendiam uma doutrina constitucional. Eça foi internado no Colégio da Lapa, no Porto, de onde saiu em 1861, com dezasseis anos, para a Universidade de Coimbra, onde estudou Direito. Num ambiente boémio da cidade universitária de Coimbra estes jovens reuniam-se para trocar ideias, livros e formas para renovar a vida política e cultural portuguesa, que estava a viver uma autêntica revolução social com a introdução dos novos meios de transportes ferroviários que traziam, todos os dias, novidades do centro da Europa, influenciando esta geração para novas ideologias e valores. Foi nesse grupo que Eça conheceu os futuros escritores e poetas, Teófilo Braga, Ramalho Ortigão, Guerra Junqueiro, Guilherme de Azevedo, Oliveira Martins, entre outros; mas sobretudo, foi aí que travou amizade com Antero de Quental, um jovem carismático a quem os membros do grupo chamavam de líder e que incentivou os restantes a seguir e a difundir as então recentes correntes ideológicas e literárias europeias: o Positivismo, o Socialismo e o Realismo-Naturalismo. Notabilizou-se pela originalidade e riqueza do seu estilo e linguagem, nomeadamente pelo realismo descritivo e pela crítica social constantes nos seus romances mas, tal como o crítico literário, Jacinto Prado Coelho disse: ""foi mais analista social do que psicólogo; ironizou Portugal porque muito o amava e o queria melhor.""",,,10/28/01,1992,"['Jacinto', 'José Fernandes', 'Jacinto Galião', 'Cintinho', 'Grilo', 'Joaninha']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Portugal', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'School', 'Adult', '19th Century']",,9789725681268,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1244543352l/1092477.jpg,3.74,[],294.0,4.0,,1092477.A_Cidade_e_as_Serras,,,,,88.0,5515.0,247,,Verbo,"['1454', '2037', '1367', '463', '194']",,,[],,
"Eça de Queirós, Ester de Lemos (Introdução)",Os Maias,,Portuguese,,"Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #15Os Maias é uma das obras mais conhecidas do escritor português Eça de Queiroz. O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acção de Os Maias passa-se em Lisboa, na segunda metade do século XIX, e apresenta-nos a história de três gerações da família Maia. A acção inicia-se no Outono de 1875, quando Afonso da Maia, nobre e pobre proprietário, se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recém formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descrição da casa - ""O Ramalhete,"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassóis, e não em algo fresco ou campestre, tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpático do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou, pois não se lhe conhecem defeitos. É um homem de carácter, culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. Após o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exílio por razões de ordem política. Há em Os Maias um retrato da Lisboa da epóca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequência até ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vá a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. É possível seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio Público, e que é descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o país uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa Olávia...), é tudo uma choldra ignóbil. Predomina uma visão de estrangeirado, de quem só valoriza as civilizações superiores - da França e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os políticos são mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boémios e dissolutos, retrógrados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boémios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto não conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois não há hipódromo à altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas não vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cúmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda há alguma esperanca implícita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e João da Ega dizem que o apetite humano é a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terão apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes está a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa não leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas começam a correr para apanhar o americano (eléctrico). Mais do que crítica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um país - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde A Cidade e as Serras, expõe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raízes rurais ancestrais não atingidas pela degradação da civilização, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'Os Maias.",,,10/28/88,April 2003,"['Carlos da Maia', 'João da Ega', 'Maria Eduarda', 'Afonso da Maia', 'Maria Monforte', 'Eusébiozinho', 'Alencar', 'Conde de Gouvarinho', 'Sousa Neto', 'Palma Cavalão', 'Dâmaso Salcede', 'Steinbroken', 'Cohen', 'Craft', 'Condessa de Gouvarinho', 'Cruges', 'Tancredo', 'Sr. Guimarães', 'Rufino']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Portugal', 'School', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']",,9789725681367,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg,4.02,"['PEN Translation Prize for Margaret Jull Costa (2008)', 'Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2008)']",2584.0,30.0,,1249630.Os_Maias,,,,,93.0,17143.0,681,,Verbo,"['6235', '6476', '3205', '925', '302']",,,[],,
"Eça de Queirós, Margaret Jull Costa (Translator)",The Crime of Father Amaro,,English,,"Eça de Queirs's novel is a lurid satire of clerical corruption in a town in Portugal during a period before and after the 1871 Paris Commune.""Young, virile Father Amaro arrives in Leira and is taken in as a lodger by São Joaneira. Her budding, devout, dewy-lipped daughter Amélia is soon lusted after by the young priest. What ensues is a secret love affair amidst a host of compelling minor characters: Canon Dias, a priest, glutton, and Sao Joaneira's lover; Dona Maria da Assuncao, a wealthy widow with a roomful of religious relics, agog at any hint of sex; Joao Eduardo, repressed atheist, free-thinker, and suitor to Amelia. Eca's incisive critique flies like a shattering mirror, jabbing everything from the hypocrisy of a rich and powerful Church, to the provincialism of Portuguese society of the time.Haunting, The Crime of Father Amaro is the ghost of a forgotten religion of tolerance, wisdom, and equality.

Having spent all of his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and native elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. Blackfoot Physics is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages--the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity's understanding.

  Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom.  But things have changed so there's nothing holding Jack in check any longer.  Other changes are occurring as well.  Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken's time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place.
   
  Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady.  Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality.  But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom's go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy.  
   
  Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby.  The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined.
   
  Now the stage is set for Jack's massive assault on Rasalom.  Jack knows he's got just one shot.  But it's not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn's child and minimize collateral damage.  So, he comes up with a foolproof plan.
   
  But fools are always with us….

F. Scott Fitzgerald,A Life in Letters,A New Collection Edited and Annotated by Matthew J. Bruccoli,,Biography & Autobiography,"A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary ""jazz age"" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.",,,,1995.0,,,,0684801531,9780684801537,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1oz-yAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.24,,,,,,,,,,,,528.0,,,,178.0,,,,

Scott Fitzgerald, un clasic al literaturii americane care azi este mai citit ca niciodată. Unele dintre acestea au fost oferite spre publicare revistelor importante din anii ’30, dar nu au apărut niciodată în timpul vieţii lui Fitzgerald. Altele au forma unor scenarii de film sau sinopsisuri după care nu s-a mai făcut nici un film. Altele nu au fost acceptate din cauză că subiectul abordat sau stilul lor diferea de ceea ce aşteptau editorii de la Fitzgerald. Au fost şi povestiri pierdute, ieşind la lumină abia în anii din urmă. Însă toate au fost pierdute într-un fel sau altul: pierdute în haosul chinuitor al existenţei greu încercate a lui Fitzgerald de la mijlocul anilor ’30; pierdute pentru cititori pentru că editorii din epocă nu înţelegeau sau nu acceptau ceea ce încerca el să scrie.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald wrote the novel as Trimalchio and submitted it to Maxwell Perkins, his editor at Scribner's, who had the novel set in type and sent the galleys to Fitzgerald in France. Fitzgerald then virtually rewrote the novel in galleys, producing the book we know as The Great Gatsby. This first version, Trimalchio, has never been published and has only been read by a handful of people. It is markedly different from The Great Gatsby: two chapters were completely rewritten for the published novel, and the rest of the book was heavily revised. Characterization is different, the narrative voice of Nick Carraway is altered and, most importantly, the revelation of Jay Gatsby's past is handled in a wholly different way. James L.W.

Included are classic novellas, such as ""The Rich Boy,"" ""May Day,"" and ""The Diamond as Big as the Ritz,"" as well as a remarkable body of work he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post and its sister ""slicks."" These stories can be read as an autobiographical journal of a great writer's career, an experience deepened by the illuminating introductory headnotes that Matthew Bruccoli has written for each story, placing it in its literary and biographical context.Together, these forty-three stories compose a vivid picture of a lost era, but their brilliance is timeless.

F.M. Christensen,Pornography: The Other Side,,English,,"A unique and important book. I have never read any work which analyzes the subject in such a manner. This book is more thorough and has a more liberated point of view than others which attempt to tackle this `hot potato' of the 1980s. Men should read this book. Women should read this book.Karen DeCrow, former President, NOWThis study slices like a laser through all the fog of rhetoric, disinformation, bias, and fear that has long enveloped all discussions of the subject of pornography in the US. No argument in favor of the censorship of such material can be considered valid unless the basic arguments of this study are answered. . . . This is a valuable resource for all academic libraries and could well become a fundamental weapon in the war to preserve the First Amendment. This book should be purchased by all but the smallest libraries; it may well be the most honest discussion of the subject ever written. ChoiceIn the continuing debate over pornography, two arguments stand out: that it is evil and should be censored, or that it is evil but censorship is a greater evil. F. M. Christensen presents the other side of this debate in what will surely be one of the most controversial books on the subject. Pornography: The Other Side convincingly argues that anti-pornography campaigns are themselves morally evil. The author defends this startling claim with a scientific persuasiveness. He successfully opens the pornography debate to include the whole picture, allowing the reader to grasp another side to this ongoing debate with concise, practical arguments. Students and scholars of all the social sciences, as well as the informed general reader, will find Pornography: The Other Side a source of stimulating ideas.Christensen concludes that pornography itself is not the fundamental issue for those who oppose it. Vehement opposition to pornography, according to this book, is a symptom of tragically mistaken beliefs about sex. What this book is really about, writes the author, is sex--and the evil effects on the lives of all of us which irrational attitudes toward that subject continue to have.",,,05/01/90,May 7th 1990,[],Paperback,[],,9780313360572,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347368571l/6850757.jpg,0.0,[],47.0,1.0,,6850757-pornography,,,,,,0.0,188,,Praeger Publishers,[],,,[],,

With her powers awakening, all vampires want to drag her down to the pit. But Lucian is territorial. She’s the first female Vessel… and he’s convinced she belongs to him. Saucy and tauntingly surprising, Black Moon captures the struggle between burning desire or denying the heart.

Thus begins Enaiat's remarkable and often punishing five-year ordeal.When ten-year-old Enaiatollah Akbari's small village in Afghanistan falls prey to Taliban rule in early 2000, his mother shepherds the boy across the border into Pakistan but has to leave him there all alone to fend for himself. Thus begins Enaiat's remarkable and often punish­ing five-year ordeal, which takes him through Iran, Turkey, and Greece before he seeks political asylum in Italy at the age of fifteen. Along the way, Enaiat endures the crippling physical and emotional agony of dangerous border crossings, trekking across bitterly cold mountain pathways for days on end or being stuffed into the false bottom of a truck. But not every­one is as resourceful, resilient, or lucky as Enaiat, and there are many heart-wrenching casualties along the way. Based on Enaiat's close collaboration with Italian novelist Fabio Geda and expertly rendered in English by an award-winning translator, this novel reconstructs the young boy's memories, perfectly preserving the childlike perspective and rhythms of an intimate oral history.

Discover The Spiritual Successor To ""The Origin Of Species."" Religion and science have been fighting an undeclared war for centuries. Ever since we stepped out of the dark ages and modern science started taking its first baby steps, people have been debating the connection between metaphysics and physics. And human evolution is one of the most controversial issues. Until now. This eye- opening book will offer you an in-depth understanding of evolution from a religio-scientific point of view. God The Evolver - Bridging The Gap Between Metaphysics & Science! If you are a serious free thinker without any religious or scientific prejudices, then this book is for you. If you are not afraid to step into spiritual no-man's land and test your knowledge, then this book will offer you a game-changing perspective. By combining religion, philosophy and science, author Faiz King has created a comprehensive guide to the struggle of religion and science. What Makes The Human Mind So Special? Back To Metaphysics. By the end of this book you will be able to understand the debate and realize that higher-order religious processes (e.g. Metaphysics) are necessary to realize the full extent of the rational and abstract properties of our human mind. And that's exactly what sets us apart from the rest of the creatures that live on this planet. God's Plan - How To Understand Centuries Of Evolution. After over 20 years of meticulous research, Faiz King has created the definitive successor to Charles Darwin's ""The Origin Of Species"" that is not afraid to take on this science giant and prove that Metaphysics (and subsequently God) is behind the development of modern science as we know it.

Fandy Hutari (Goodreads Author),Sandiwara dan Perang: Politisasi Terhadap Aktifitas Sandiwara Modern Masa Jepang,,Indonesian,,"FRAGMEN sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang terkuak dan memiliki arti dalam buku ini. Studi Fandy Hutari seperti menggenapi kerja H.B. Jassin dalam studi Kesusastraan di Masa Jepang (1969). Masa pendudukan Jepang (1942--1945) kerap diklaim sebagai masa menentukan untuk perubahan nasib kesusastraan dan sandiwara. A. Teeuw, Ajip Rosidi, Jakob Sumardjo, dan H.B. Jassin mengakui bahwa masa pendek itu telah memberi ruh lain dalam pembentukan sastra Indonesia modern. Bagaimana dengan nasib sandiwara?Peringatan H.B. Jassin (1969: 7): ""Menafikan kesusastraan dalam zaman Jepang adalah menafikan suatu wajah kehidupan dalam perjalanan membentuk sejarah."" Peringatan itu pantas menjadi dalil untuk kehadiran buku Sandiwara dan Perang sebagai studi atas nasib sandiwara dalam masa pendudukan Jepang. Penulis buku ini mengakui sejarah sandiwara pada masa Jepang tak mungkin diabaikan dalam alur sejarah teater Indonesia modern.Sandiwara pada masa itu kental dengan intervensi kekuasaan untuk propaganda. Wajah politis itu kerap terpinggirkan dan terabaikan dalam sejarah sandiwara modern Indonesia. Fandy Hutari dengan teliti mendata dan menafsirkan dalam konteks zaman 1940-an untuk mengetahui proses pembentukan sandiwara Indonesia modern dalam bayang-bayang kolonial.Penulis menelusuri sejarah sandiwara mulai dari 1925--1941 sebelum sampai pada fokus nasib sandiwara pada masa pendudukan Jepang. Tahun 1925 diakui penulis sebagai fase menentukan untuk pembaruan dalam jagat sandiwara. Pembaruan itu sebagai pembeda atas zaman stambul atau opera. Contoh pembaruan tampak pada Perkumpulan Sandiwara Miss Riboet Orion (1925) dengan pimpinan Tio Tek Djien dan Perkumpulan Sandiwara The Malay Opera Dardanella (1926) dengan pimpinan A. Piedro. Dua kelompok sandiwara itu terlibat dalam persaingan sengit untuk meraih perhatian publik dengan garapan pertunjukan modern.Pendudukan Jepang tahun 1942 menjadi titik balik untuk kehidupan sandiwara dalam wajah lain. Jepang memakai propaganda sebagai dalil untuk legitimasi kekuasaan. Sendenbu (Departemen Propaganda) dibentuk untuk menagani sistem dan operasionalisasi propaganda dengan memanfaatkan fil, surat kabar, pamflet, buku, poster, foto, siaran radio, pidato, seni pertunjukkan tradisional, dan seni sandiwara modern.Fandy Hutari menafsirkan bahwa sandiwara modern dipilih sebagai alat propaganda karena dapat menggelorakan perasaan orang banyak. Penguatan untuk propaganda dalam sandiwara tampak kentara mulai tahun 1944--1945.Sendenbu dalam praktek propaganda dibantu Keimin Bunka Shidoso (Kantor Pusat Kebudayaan) dengan tugas: (1) mempromosikan kesenian-kesenian tradisional Indonesia; (2) mendidik dan melatih seniman-seniman Indonesia; (3) memperkenalkan dan menyebarkan kebudayaan Jepang. Realisasi dari kerja Sendenbu itu adalah pendirian Sekolah Tonil di Jakarta pada tahun 1942. Sekolah ini memiliki tujuan mendidik penulis naskah profesional, aktor, dan kerabat sandiwara dengan orientasi untuk propaganda.Beberapa catatan menyebutkan bahwa sejak 1942 sandiwara seperti menemukan ruh kembali untuk mengisi fragmen sejarah Indonesia. Armijn Pane menengarai kebangkitan itu mendapati pengaruh dari program propaganda Jepang.Perkumpulan sandiwara pun tumbuh dengan gairah zaman antara lain Tjahaja Asia, Bintang Soerabaja, Dewi Mada, Tjahaja Timoer, Bintang Warnasari, Sinar Sari, Persafi, dan Maya. Perkumpulan Sandiwara Penggemar Maya berdiri pada 27 Mei 1944 dengan tokoh Usmar Ismail, El Hakim (Aboe Hanifah), Rosihan Anwar, D. Djajakoesoema, dan Surjo Soemanto. Kelompok ini jadi bukti pembaruan sandiwara modern di Indonesia meski susah melepaskan diri dari pengaruh kolonial Jepang dengan dalil propaganda.Konsep dan teknik propaganda dalam masa Jepang dijelaskan Fandy Hutari dalam tiga media: (1) Propaganda dalam pertunjukkan perkumpulan sandiwara; (2) propaganda melalui siaran sandiwara radio; dan (3) pesan propaganda dalam naskah lakon sandiwara.Dalil propaganda itu kentara dalam pengumuman di koran Asia Raya (20 September 1943) mengenai sayembara mengarang cerita sandiwara oleh Keimin Bunka Shidosho. Tema sayembara adalah anjuran tentang semangat cinta tanah air, keikhalasan berkorban demi kepentingan umum, dan semangat membela tanah air. Pemenang sayembara: F.A. Tamboenan (Poesaka Sedjati dari Seorang Ajah), J. Hoetagalung (Koeli dan Roomusya), A.M. Soekma Rahayoe (Banteng Bererong), S. Yamamato (Kemenangan Tertanggoeng), R. Srimoertono (Penginapan Noesantara), dan Nakao Masakozu (Seroean Zaman).

Hélène identifies strongly with Jane’s tribulations, and when she is lost in the pages of this wonderful book, she is able to ignore her tormentors. But when Hélène is humiliated on a class trip in front of her entire grade, she needs more than a fictional character to allow her to see herself as a person deserving of laughter and friendship.Leaving the outcasts’ tent one night, Hélène encounters a fox, a beautiful creature with whom she shares a moment of connection. But when Suzanne Lipsky frightens the fox away, insisting that it must be rabid, Hélène’s despair becomes even more pronounced: now she believes that only a diseased and dangerous creature would ever voluntarily approach her. But then a new girl joins the outcasts’ circle, Géraldine, who does not even appear to notice that she is in danger of becoming an outcast herself.

O these fashionable people!' Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions - as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story.

Farah Mendlesohn,Diana Wynne Jones,Children's Literature and the Fantastic Tradition,,Biography & Autobiography,"This study follows the aesthetic of the sublime from Burke and Kant, through Wordsworth and the Shelleys, into Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot and Hardy. Exploring the continuities between the romantic and Victorian ""periods"" that have so often been rather read as differences, the book demonstrate that the sublime mode enables the transition from a paradigm of overwhelming power exemplified by the body of the king to the pervasive power of surveillance utilized by the rising middle classes. While the domestic woman connected with the rise of the middle class is normally seen as beautiful, the book contends that the moral authority given to this icon of depth and interiority is actually sublime. The binary of the beautiful and the sublime seeks to contain the sublimity of womanhood by insisting on sublimity's masculine character. This is the book's most important claim: rather than exemplifying masculine strength, the sublime marks the transition to a system of power gendered as feminine and yet masks that transition because it fears the power it ostensibly accords to the feminine. This aesthetic is both an inheritance the Victorians receive from their romantic predecessors, and, more importantly, a broad historical phenomenon that questions the artificial boundaries between romantic and Victorian.",,,,2005.0,,,,0415970237,9780415970235,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0NVlQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.09,,,,,,,,,,,,240.0,,,,46.0,,,,

Fareed Zakaria,The Post-American World,,English,,"""This is not a book about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else."" So begins Fareed Zakaria's important new work on the era we are now entering. Following on the success of his best-selling The Future of Freedom, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the ""rise of the rest""—the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others—as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era?

Fatima Farheen Mirza (Goodreads Author),A Place for Us,,English,,"A Place for Us unfolds the lives of an Indian-American Muslim family, gathered together in their Californian hometown to celebrate the eldest daughter, Hadia's, wedding - a match of love rather than tradition. It is here, on this momentous day, that Amar, the youngest of the siblings, reunites with his family for the first time in three years. Rafiq and Layla must now contend with the choices and betrayals that lead to their son's estrangement - the reckoning of parents who strove to pass on their cultures and traditions to their children; and of children who in turn struggle to balance authenticity in themselves with loyalty to the home they came from.In a narrative that spans decades and sees family life through the eyes of each member, A Place For Us charts the crucial moments in the family's past, from the bonds that bring them together to the differences that pull them apart. And as siblings Hadia, Huda, and Amar attempt to carve out a life for themselves, they must reconcile their present culture with their parent's faith, to tread a path between the old world and the new, and learn how the smallest decisions can lead to the deepest of betrayals.A deeply affecting and resonant story, A Place for Us is truly a book for our times: a moving portrait of what it means to be an American family today, a novel of love, identity and belonging that eloquently examines what it means to be both American and Muslim -- and announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.",,,,June 12th 2018,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Family', 'Adult', 'India', 'Book Club', 'Novels']",,9781524763558,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1517006183l/36840397.jpg,4.15,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction and for Debut Author (2018)', 'Reading Women Award Nominee for Fiction (2018)']",193.0,2.0,,36840397-a-place-for-us,,,,,95.0,41131.0,385,,SJP for Hogarth,"['17225', '15435', '6387', '1580', '504']",,,[],,

Federico Moccia,Tre metri sopra il cielo,,Italian,,"Una grande storia d'amore. Un microcosmo di giovani vite arrabbiate che cerca di staccarsi da terra, di camminare ""tre metri sopra il cielo"". Le ragazze vestono Onyx, o qualunque sia l'ultima griffe in fatto di body, parlano di Avant, di Marsan e delle mode dell'ultimo minuto. I ragazzi invece girano in moto. Le ragazze si preparano a incontrare il ragazzo della loro vita. I ragazzi si sfidano in prove di resistenza fisica, di velocità, di rischio. Fino all'ultimo respiro. SUllo sfondo di una frenetica vita di clan, di banda (il mitico gruppo dei budokani: Schello, Pollo, Lucone), Step e Babi si incontrano. Babi è un'ottima studentessa, Step è un violento, un picchiatore, uno che passa i pomeriggi davanti al bar con gli amici o in palestra e la sera sulla moto o nella bisca dove si gioca a biliardo. Appartengono a due mondi diversi, ma finiscono per innamorarsi. Non è un rapporto semplice perché nessuno dei due cede facilmente. Eppure si trasformano. Babi è irriconoscibile agli occhi dei genitori. Step rivela aspetti che ben poco collimano con la sua immagine, faticosamente costruita, di superduro. E, in effetti, muscoli, palestra e violenza nascondono un trauma, un nodo irrisolto.Tre metri sopra il cielo è un romanzo di vite quotidiane, una commedia romantica, un ritratto moviemntatissimo di adolescenti allo sbando.Pubblicato da un piccolo editore romano, è circolato per anni in fotocopie, diventando un cult fra i giovani della capitale.""Il sole sta salendo, è una bella mattinata. Babi sta andando a scuola, Step non è ancora andato a dormire dalla notte prima. Un giorno come un altro. Ma al semaforo si trovano uno accanto all'altra.

Federico Moccia,Scusa ma ti chiamo amore,,Italian,,"Niki e le sue amiche sono all'ultimo anno di scuola. Malgrado abbiano la maturità ne combinano ogni giorno di tutti i colori. Sfilate, feste, rave e tutti i possibili eventi anche fuori Roma. Alex è un ""ragazzo"" di quasi trentasette anni. Si è lasciato da poco e senza un vero perché con la sua fidanzata storica. Intorno a lui ruota un mondo complicato e divertente: i suoi genitori, le sue sorelle sposate e con figli e poi i suoi tre amici Enrico, Flavio e Pietro, anche loro tutti già sposati ma ognuno con le proprie particolarità. Enrico è geloso, Flavio metodico, Pietro invece è in fissa con tutte le donne del mondo. Alex è un pubblicitario e ha delle grandi responsabilità all'interno della sua azienda. Ma è appena arrivato un giovane rampante che mette a repentaglio il suo lavoro. E tutto questo non sarebbe niente se quella mattina Alex non incontrasse Niki. O meglio, se i due non si scontrassero. Niki è una bella ragazza, è divertente, è intelligente, è spiritosa, è allegra. C'è solo un piccolo dettaglio. Ha diciassette anni. Vent'anni meno di Alex. E dopo l'incontro di quella mattina, nulla sarà più come prima. Il mondo adulto si scontra con quello degli adolescenti. Ed ecco mamme e figlie in una discussione continua, papà che sono ancora ragazzini e ragazzi giovanissimi che sono già troppo adulti. E ancora ragazze sognatrici, ragazze deluse, ragazze romantiche e ragazze troppo folli. E adulti che invece hanno messo da parte tutti i loro sogni e vivono, o meglio sopravvivono, senza avere il coraggio di fermarsi a riflettere. Questo romanzo è la voglia di ritrovare la propria libertà, la voglia di avere sentimenti veri, di amare senza convenzioni e senza troppi perché. È la quotidianità ma è anche il sogno. È la voglia di dire basta a quel domani che ogni giorno ci raccontiamo, nel quale siamo sempre sicuri che faremo qualcosa di speciale. Ma intanto i giorni passano e quel domani non arriva. Di lui non c'è traccia. E allora ecco la nostra fuga, la più bella, la più folle, la più pazza. Una fuga d'amore. E poi quel faro. Insomma, un tuffo dove l'acqua è più blu.

The Swiss Entrepreneur lived and worked in North Korea for seven years, one of the few foreign businessmen there. After the experience, Abt felt compelled to write A Capitalist in North Korea to describe the multifaceted society he encountered. North Korea, at the time, was heavily sanctioned by the UN, which made it extremely difficult to do business. Yet, he discovered that it was a place where plastic surgery and South Korean TV dramas were wildly popular and where he rarely needed to walk more than a block to grab a quick hamburger. He was closely monitored, and once faced accusations of spying, yet he learned that young North Koreans are hopeful - signing up for business courses in anticipation of a brighter, more open, future. In A Capitalist in North Korea, Abt shares these and many other unusual facts and insights about one of the world's most secretive nations.Author Felix Abt is a politically neutral businessman and, therefore, does not share partisan views about North Korea. He is, however, critical of unfair North Korea reporting and does what he can to contribute to a more objective view of a country he knows much better than the journalists and bloggers writing about it. Abt is a former investor at several legitimate Joint Venture companies in North Korea which are now being driven into bankruptcy by U.N.

Ferdiriva Hamzah,Cado-cado: Catatan Dodol Calon Dokter,,Indonesian,,"Apa jadinya kalo kamu harus hidup berdampingan dengan orang-orang yang mengalami gangguan jiwa di sebuah rumah sakit jiwa? Mungkin, sebagian dari kamu akan menjawab, “Jangan sampe deh!”. Tapi, bagi seorang ko-ass atau asisten dokter, mereka harus siap di tempatkan di mana saja, termasuk di rumah sakit jiwa.Hal inilah yang dialami Riva. Waktu kecil, Riva emang udah akrab dengan kata-kata gila. Karena itulah, saat ia harus ko-ass di ilmu kedokteran jiwa, ia sangat takut ketemu orang-orang berpenyakit jiwa ini, khususnya mereka yang mengidap skizofrenia.Begitu Riva sampai di tempat itu, ia pun disuruh untuk memeriksa beberapa pasien sakit jiwa yang udah menantinya. Satu masukan berharga yang ia dapatkan dari Budi—teman satu ko-assnya—adalah belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila!Akhirnya, Riva pun mengikuti saran Budi. Memang sih, saran itu benar-benar manjur dan ampuh. Terbukti, semua pasien yang ia tangani ternyata pada nurut semua, bahkan mereka tertawa dan bersikap begitu baik terhadapnya.Sayang, apa yang telah dilakukan Riva—nyanyi-nyanyi, lompat-lompat, dan menari-nari seperti orang gila—di hadapan pasiennya, ternyata sangat jauh dari bayangan suksesnya teori ‘belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila’. Karena, yang ia hadapi saat itu adalah pasien depresi ringan.Jelas aja mereka, bisa secepat itu tertawa. Coba kalau mereka adalah pasien skizofrenia yang benar-benar parah. Mungkin, belagak gila udah nggak akan mempan lagi!Menghadapi pasien sakit jiwa ini hanyalah salah satu pengalaman konyol dan aneh Ferdiriva Hamzah atau Riva saat ko-ass. Masih banyak pengalaman gokil lainnya yang bisa kamu temukan dalam buku Cado-Cado; Catatan Dodol Calon Dokter yang diterbitkan oleh Bukuné.Selama ko-ass itu, Riva harus menghadapi berbagai macam tingkah dari pasien-pasiennya. Ada yang pemarah, pemalu, periang, penggerutu, dan sebagainya. Mulai dari merawat pasien sakit jiwa, menghadapi pasien waria yang centil-centil, sampe pasien preman pernah dilalui Riva.
