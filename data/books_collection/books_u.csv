Unhinged,,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Retellings', 'Magic', 'Paranormal', 'Fairy Tales', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Fiction']","Alyssa Gardner has been down the rabbit hole and faced the bandersnatch. She saved the life of Jeb, the guy she loves, and escaped the machinations of the disturbingly seductive Morpheus and the vindictive Queen Red. Now all she has to do is graduate high school and make it through prom so she can attend the prestigious art school in London she's always dreamed of. That would be easier without her mother, freshly released from an asylum, acting overly protective and suspicious. And it would be much simpler if the mysterious Morpheus didn’t show up for school one day to tempt her with another dangerous quest in the dark, challenging Wonderland—where she (partly) belongs. As prom and graduation creep closer, Alyssa juggles Morpheus’s unsettling presence in her real world with trying to tell Jeb the truth about a past he’s forgotten. Glimpses of Wonderland start to bleed through her art and into her world in very disturbing ways, and Morpheus warns that Queen Red won’t be far behind. If Alyssa stays in the human realm, she could endanger Jeb, her parents, and everyone she loves. But if she steps through the rabbit hole again, she'll face a deadly battle that could cost more than just her head.",Splintered #2,,,January 7th 2014,"['Alyssa Victoria Gardner', 'Jebediah ""Jeb"" Holt', 'Mr. Mason', 'Alison Gardner', 'Thomas Gardner', 'Morpheus', 'Jenara Holt', 'Corbin', 'Mr. Lamb', 'Taelor Tremont', 'Chessie', 'Gossamer', 'Rabid White', 'Carpet Beetle', 'Sister Two Twid', 'Sister One Twid']",Hardcover,,9781613125342,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366994000l/17449197.jpg,4.22,[],620.0,7.0,,,,95.0,21931.0,387,Amulet Books,"['10429', '7164', '3332', '767', '239']",,"['Pleasance, Texas (United States)', 'The Nether Realm/Wonderland']",,['A.

REVIEWS:  ""It takes rare talent for a man to write a novel from a male POV and have it published to great critical and commercial acclaim. But it takes a miracle for that same male, or in this case males, to write a novel from the POV of a teenage girl and have it turn out as incredibly as did the new StoneHouse YA by Aaron Patterson and Chris White, AIREL. From the first sentence, I felt compelled to dive into this young woman's story and just as importantly, I felt like I personally knew her, which means I laughed, stressed and cried right along with her. A beautifully written and crafted fiction about teenage innocence, faith, loss and love. A must read for teens and adults alike."" --Vincent Zandri, International Bestselling Author of The Remains, The Innocent, and Concrete Pearl  ""I am happy to say that this novel is one of my favorites of its kind. I never thought I could read a novel like this and be so swept away! I am always willing to try new books, but I usually steer clear of this kind of novel. Not anymore! Not when I can be so engrossed into the character's story, like I was with the beautiful AIREL, that before I know, it's over.

  Not entitled to get angry? Really?
 It’s a radical, provocative idea: We’re not entitled to get offended or stay angry. The idea of our own “righteous anger” is a myth. It is the number one problem in our societies today and, as Dallas Willard says, Christians have not been taught out of it. As it turns out, giving up our “right” to be offended can be one of the most freeing, healthy, simplifying, relaxing, refreshing, stress-relieving, encouraging things we can do. In Unoffendable readers will find something of immeasurable value—a concrete, practical way to live life with less stress. They’ll adjust their expectations to fit human nature and replace perpetual anger with refreshing humility and gratitude. The book offers a unique viewpoint, challenging the idea that Christians can ever harbor “righteous anger” or that there evenis such a thing for believers. Few other books exist with such a radical, provocative proposal to consider. We have no right to anger. We are to get rid of it, period. Completely. And it is possible to choose to be “unoffendable.” Through the author’s winsome, humorous, and conversational style, this book doesn’t add another thing to do on a stressed-out person’s ever-growing list. Better, it actually seeks to lift religious burdens from readers’ backs and allow them to experience the joy of gratitude, perhaps for the first time, every single day of their lives.",,,04/01/15,April 14th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,,9780529123855,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440727387l/24648636._SY475_.jpg,4.47,[],100.0,1.0,,,,98.0,3114.0,198,Thomas Nelson,"['1904', '865', '272', '51', '22']",,[],,['Brant Hansen']
Ultimatum Of The Nameless God,,"['Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Urban Fantasy']","Taereun: Battleground of the Damned was never really a game. It was a testing ground to find minds and souls for the The Nameless God to use, and for tens of thousands of players, the game became reality, when they were put in the bodies of their characters. The Nameless God told them that he would return them to their real lives, if they fought through the Labyrinth of Yggr and freed his body from beneath the city of Haven. After searching for over 11 years, they found the Gate leading to Haven.After being murdered right before the gate to Haven was opened, Mark McGuinness wakes up in a hospital in his original body. As a child, he was in an automobile accident. A freak whose body rejects most medical treatments, he was left scarred and disfigured. Angry, bitter and disgusted with the world, he had used Taereun: Battleground of the Damned to take out his frustration and anger, so he would not lose control and hurt or kill someone in real life. The closest he had ever come to being happy was living as Talon, during the eleven year search for Haven.Having learned about the Power called ki, Mark McGuinness discovers that his human body is capable of channeling and using it. Once again armed with Power, he finds a way to travel from Earth to Taereun. He has questions he wants answered and people he owes. Whether mortal or divine, he will let no one and nothing stand in his way.WARNING: For Mature Audiences Only.

Ultimate Questions,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Self Help']","How to live meaningfully in the face of the unknowableWe human beings had no say in existing--we just opened our eyes and found ourselves here. We have a fundamental need to understand who we are and the world we live in. Reason takes us a long way, but mystery remains. When our minds and senses are baffled, faith can seem justified--but faith is not knowledge. In Ultimate Questions, acclaimed philosopher Bryan Magee provocatively argues that we have no way of fathoming our own natures or finding definitive answers to the big questions we all face.With eloquence and grace, Magee urges us to be the mapmakers of what is intelligible, and to identify the boundaries of meaningfulness. He traces this tradition of thought to his chief philosophical mentors--Locke, Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer--and shows why this approach to the enigma of existence can enrich our lives and transform our understanding of the human predicament. As Magee puts it, There is a world of difference between being lost in the daylight and being lost in the dark.The crowning achievement to a distinguished philosophical career, Ultimate Questions is a deeply personal meditation on the meaning of life and the ways we should live and face death.-- ""Library Journal""",,,02/22/16,March 1st 2016,[],Hardcover,,9780691170657,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445791997l/26597404.jpg,3.97,[],100.0,1.0,,,,94.0,225.0,144,Princeton University Press,"['69', '98', '44', '11', '3']",,[],,['Bryan Magee']

Underworld,,"['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century', 'Americana']","While Eisenstein documented the forces of totalitarianism and Stalinism upon the faces of the Russian peoples, DeLillo offers a stunning, at times overwhelming, document of the twin forces of the Cold War and American culture, compelling that ""swerve from evenness"" in which he finds events and people both wondrous and horrifying.Underworld opens with a breathlessly graceful prologue set during the final game of the Giants-Dodgers pennant race in 1951. Written in what DeLillo calls ""super-omniscience"" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter—the ""shot heard around the world""—and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand.""It's all falling indelibly into the past,"" writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that ""global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways,"" and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.Through fragments and interlaced stories—including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others—DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.",,,10/28/97,1999,[],Paperback,,9780330369954,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334304280l/11761.jpg,3.92,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for Fiction (1998)', 'American Book Award (1998)', 'William Dean Howells Medal (2000)', 'Ambassador Book Award for Fiction (1998)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (1997)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1997)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (1999)']",1850.0,24.0,,,,89.0,26760.0,827,Picador,"['9888', '8824', '5104', '1995', '949']",,[],,['Don Delillo']

Conjuring contemporary Venice in exquisite and alluring detail, this is widely hailed as the finest installment yet of the Commissario Guido Brunetti series.For over a decade, Donna Leon has topped European bestseller lists and captivated fans throughout the world with her series of mysteries featuring the shrewd, charismatic Commissario Guido Brunetti. Guiding us through contemporary Venice's dark undercurrents of personal politics, corruption, and intrigue, Donna Leon's is ""crime writing of the highest order: powerful, relevant and too full of human failings"" (The Guardian).This time, Commissario Brunetti faces an unsettling case that, because he is the father of a young son, hits him especially close to home. The body of a student has been found hanged in Venice's elite, highly cloistered military academy. The young man is the son of a doctor and former politician, a member of Parliament who had an impeccable integrity all too rare in Italian politics. Dr. Moro is clearly devastated by his son's death, but while both he and his apparently estranged wife seem convinced that the boy's death could not have been suicide, neither appears eager to help in the investigation of the mysterious circumstances in which he died. Bolstered by the help the elegant and crafty Signorina Elettra, and the cooking and sympathetic ear of his wife, Paola, Commissario Brunetti sets off on an investigation that gets him caught up in the strange and stormy politics of his country's powerful elite.When Brunetti plunges into Dr. Moro's political career and the circumstances of the doctor's estrangement from his wife, he discovers unsettling details. How to explain the mysterious hunting accident in which Signora Moro was involved, and the fact that her marriage crumbled so soon after? As he investigates, Brunetti is faced with a wall of silence, because the military, who protects its own, and civilians, even at the cost of their lives, are unwilling to talk. Is this the natural reluctance of Italians to involve themselves with the authorities, or is Brunetti facing something altogether darker?

Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior,,"['Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Sociology']","No matter what we do, however kind or generous our deeds may seem, a hidden motive of selfishness lurks--or so science has claimed for years. This book, whose publication promises to be a major scientific event, tells us differently. In Unto Others philosopher Elliott Sober and biologist David Sloan Wilson demonstrate once and for all that unselfish behavior is in fact an important feature of both biological and human nature. Their book provides a panoramic view of altruism throughout the animal kingdom--from self-sacrificing parasites to insects that subsume themselves in the superorganism of a colony to the human capacity for selflessness--even as it explains the evolutionary sense of such behavior.Explaining how altruistic behavior can evolve by natural selection, this book finally gives credence to the idea of group selection that was originally proposed by Darwin but denounced as heretical in the 1960s. With their account of this controversy, Sober and Wilson offer a detailed case study of scientific change as well as an indisputable argument for group selection as a legitimate theory in evolutionary biology.Unto Others also takes a novel evolutionary approach in explaining the ultimate psychological motives behind unselfish human behavior. Developing a theory of the proximate mechanisms that most likely evolved to motivate adaptive helping behavior, Sober and Wilson show how people and perhaps other species evolved the capacity to care for others as a goal in itself.A truly interdisciplinary work that blends biology, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology, this book will permanently change not just our view of selfless behavior but also our understanding of many issues in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.",,,1998,October 1st 1999,[],Paperback,,9780674930476,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347351180l/134244.jpg,3.82,[],25.0,1.0,,,,91.0,91.0,416,Harvard University Press,"['23', '37', '23', '8', '0']",,[],,"['Elliott Sober', 'David Sloan Wilson']"

Udah Putusin Aja!,,"['Islam', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Indonesian Literature', 'Muslims', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Inspirational']","Islam tidak pernah mengharamkan cinta. Islam mengarahkan cinta agar ia berjalan pada koridornya. Bila bicara cinta di antara lawan jenis, satu-satunya jalan adalah dengan pernikahan, yang dengannya cinta menjadi halal dan penuh keberkahan. Sebaliknya, Islam melarang keras segala jenis interaksi cinta yang tiada halal. Bukan karena apa pun, tapi karena Islam adalah agama yang memuliakan manusia dan mencegah kerusakan-kerusakan yang akan terjadi pada diri manusia itu sendiri.Sialnya, kaum Muslim kini hidup dalam kungkungan masyarakat yang sebagian besar salah kaprah dalam cinta. Karenanya tidak dikenal lagi kesakralan pernikahan dan kesucian diri, apalagi kehormatan dan kemuliaan jiwa. Semua sudah terganti dengan pergaulan bebas, ada yang menyebutnya pacaran, teman tapi mesra, dibalut dalam alasan kakak-adik, teman dekat, ataupun yang lainnya.#UdahPutusinAja, sebab apa pun namanya, kelak akan bersaksi seluruh bagian tubuh di depan Allah. Karenanya, sedari dini mari mendidik cinta, mengajarinya agar ia bersemi dalam taat, bukan direndahkan oleh maksiat.

What mankind does not know is that God did not create man on Earth, but rather on MARS! When Mars could not sustain life anymore, mankind had to escape the planet and colonized Earth. Many years later, a study was written about the survival of mankind in Sol Four (Mars) and its struggle in Sol Three (Earth). We proved to be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of abuse -- always holding on to our faith in God.Doctor Ajidan Edejem, after finding out that his world was going to die, embarks in the dangerous mission to rescue as many people as possible and search for a new world. All the while, the government wants to keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about the unavoidable doom.""We discovered that the seismic activity is increasing and becoming more frequent causing volcanic eruptions, which increase the volume of sulfates in the atmosphere and break down Ozone. In other words, the atmosphere of this planet is bleeding into space. At the rate these phenomena are taking place, life on Taerr will no longer be supported in less than a month's time. The only way for our species to survive is to travel to another habitable planet. In our research, we have found a planet close to ours with a similar atmosphere about three months away. We have prepared a fleet of ships to take as many citizens as possible to this new planet.

Permeating the cracks between the past and the present is the realm of Unspent Time. Pockets of 'should have been's and 'might have happened's. Time that was allotted but never spent. In this realm we find the stories that could have been true.Such as the story of Goki Feng Ho: the ancient Chinese art of decoding the meaning of car license plates. Or the tale of Matthew G., who skip-stones through life on the back of mysterious black-outs, blinking in and out of conscious existence at random. Or the story of little Kiala, whose aunt and caretaker disappears one day, leaving her as the sole Huntress to battle the giant octopi to feed her village. Or the heartbreaking story of the man responsible for choosing the colors of the insides of your shoes. As he toils away in obscurity, his work impacts society in ways we'll never fully comprehend. Or even care about. And let's not forget the story behind Unspent Time itself, the metaphysical ramifications of which will leave the scientific community feeling, well, mostly indifferent about it...What people are saying about the 'NoHope universe' books:""Extremely witty and clever writing that contains keen insights into human nature."" --California Chronicle""The antics in these books will leave the reader laughing.

Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader's Guide,,"['Religion', 'Nonfiction', 'Lds', 'Mormonism', 'Theology', 'Church', 'Spirituality', 'Lds Non Fiction', 'Inspirational', 'Christianity']","Mark Twain once derided the Book of Mormon as ""chloroform in print."" Long and complicated, written in the language of the King James version of the Bible, it boggles the minds of many. Yet it is unquestionably one of the most influential books ever written. With over 140 million copies in print, it is a central text of one of the largest and fastest-growing faiths in the world. And, Grant Hardy shows, it's far from the coma-inducing doorstop caricatured by Twain.In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy offers the first comprehensive analysis of the work's narrative structure in its 180 year history. Unlike virtually all other recent world scriptures, the Book of Mormon presents itself as an integrated narrative rather than a series of doctrinal expositions, moral injunctions, or devotional hymns. Hardy takes readers through its characters, events, and ideas, as he explores the story and its messages. He identifies the book's literary techniques, such as characterization, embedded documents, allusions, and parallel narratives. Whether Joseph Smith is regarded as author or translator, it's noteworthy that he never speaks in his own voice; rather, he mediates nearly everything through the narrators Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni. Hardy shows how each has a distinctive voice, and all are woven into an integral whole.As with any scripture, the contending views of the Book of Mormon can seem irreconcilable. For believers, it is an actual historical document, transmitted from ancient America. For nonbelievers, it is the work of a nineteenth-century farmer from upstate New York. Hardy transcends this intractable conflict by offering a literary approach, one appropriate to both history and fiction. Regardless of whether readers are interested in American history, literature, comparative religion, or even salvation, he writes, the book can best be read if we examine the text on its own terms.",,,06/06/03,April 7th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9780199731701,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347601908l/7571146.jpg,4.42,[],81.0,1.0,,,,97.0,467.0,368,"Oxford University Press, USA","['274', '133', '47', '7', '6']",,[],,['Grant Hardy']

Undoing Border Imperialism,,"['Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Activism', 'Race', 'Social Justice', 'Feminism', 'Theory', 'Philosophy', 'Academic', 'History']","""Harsha Walia has played a central role in building some of North America’s most innovative, diverse, and effective new move­ments. That this brilliant organizer and theorist has found time to share her wisdom in this book is a tremendous gift to us all."" —Naomi Klein, author of The Shock DoctrineUndoing Border Imperialism combines academic discourse, lived experiences of displacement, and movement-based practices into an exciting new book. By reformulating immigrant rights movements within a transnational analysis of capitalism, labor exploitation, settler colonialism, state building, and racialized empire, it provides the alternative conceptual frameworks of border imperialism and decolonization. Drawing on the author’s experiences in No One Is Illegal, this work offers relevant insights for all social movement organizers on effective strategies to overcome the barriers and borders within movements in order to cultivate fierce, loving, and sustainable communities of resistance striving toward liberation. The author grounds the book in collective vision, with short contributions from over twenty organizers and writers from across North America.""Border imperialism is an apt conceptualization for capturing the politics of massive displacement due to capitalist neoglobalization. Within the wealthy countries, Canada’s No One Is Illegal is one of the most effective organizations of migrants and allies. Walia is an outstanding organizer who has done a lot of thinking and can write—not a common combination. Besides being brilliantly conceived and presented, this book is the first extended work on immigration that refuses to make First Nations sovereignty invisible."" —Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, author of Indians of the Americas and Blood on the Border""Harsha Walia’s Undoing Border Imperialism demonstrates that geography has certainly not ended, nor has the urge for people to stretch out our arms across borders to create our communities. One of the most rewarding things about this book is its capaciousness—astute insights that emerge out of careful organizing linked to the voices of a generation of strugglers, trying to find their own analysis to build their own movements to make this world our own. This is both a manual and a memoir, a guide to the world and a guide to the organizer’s heart."" —Vijay Prashad, author of The Darker Nations: A People’s History of the Third World""This book belongs in every wannabe revolutionary’s war backpack. I addictively jumped all over its contents: a radical mixtape of ancestral wisdoms to present-day-grounded organizers theoriz­ing about their own experiences. A must for me is Walia’s decision to infuse this volume’s fight against border imperialism, white supremacy, and empire with the vulnerability of her own personal narrative. This book is a breath of fresh air and offers an urgently needed movement-based praxis. Undoing Border Imperialism is too hot to be sitting on bookshelves; it will help make the revolution."" —Ashanti Alston, Black Panther elder and former political prisonerOther Contributors: Yogi Acharya, Carmen Aguirre, Tara Atluri, Annie Banks, Mel Bazil, Nazila Bettache, Adil Charkaoui, Yen Chu, Karen Cocq, Jessica Danforth, Ruby Smith Diaz, Nassim Elbardouh, Craig Fortier, Harjap Grewal, Mostafa Henaway, Freda Huson, Syed Khalid Hussan, Jane Kirby, Aylwin Lo, Karla Lottini, Alex Mah, Robyn Maynard, Graciela Flores Mendez, Cecily Nicholson, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, Toghestiy, Sozan Savehilaghi, Mac Scott, Lily Shinde, and Rafeef Ziadah.",Anarchist Intervention Series #6,,11/12/13,February 15th 2014,[],Kindle Edition,,9781849351348,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393637318l/20937784.jpg,4.49,[],79.0,1.0,,,,97.0,307.0,340,AK Press,"['196', '75', '27', '8', '1']",,[],,"['Harsha Walia', 'Andrea Smith']"

Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche,,"['Nonfiction', 'Japan', 'History', 'Japanese Literature', 'True Crime', 'Asia', 'Religion', 'Journalism', 'Cults', 'Crime']","It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack. In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and arguably Japan’s most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe—from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, Underground is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world’s most perceptive writers.",,,03/20/97,2003,[],Paperback,,9780099461098,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1443692668l/17801._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],390.0,5.0,,,,95.0,14720.0,309,Vintage,"['4026', '6167', '3734', '685', '108']",,['Japan'],,"['Haruki Murakami', 'Alfred Birnbaum', 'Philip Gabriel']"

"Ursula, Under",,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult', 'Family', 'China', '19th Century']","In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a dangerous rescue effort draws the ears and eyes of the entire country. A two-and-a-half-year-old girl has fallen down a mine shaft--the only sound is an astonished tiny intake of breath from Ursula as she goes down, like a penny into the slot of a bank, disappeared, gone. It is as if all hope for life on the planet is bound up in the rescue of this little girl, the first and only child of a young woman of Finnish extraction and her Chinese-American husband. One TV viewer following the action notes that the Wong family lives in a decrepit mobile home and wonders why all this time and money is being wasted on that half-breed trailer-trash kid. In response, the novel takes a breathtaking leap back in time to visit Ursula's most remarkable ancestors: a third-century-B.C. Chinese alchemist; an orphaned playmate of a seventeenth-century Swedish queen; Professor Alabaster Wong, a Chautauqua troupe lecturer (on exotic Chinese topics) traveling the Midwest at the end of the nineteenth century; her great-great-grandfather Jake Maki, who died at twenty-nine in a Michigan iron mine cave-in; and others whose richness and history are contained in the induplicable DNA of just one person--little Ursula Wong.Ursula's story echoes those of her ancestors, many of whom so narrowly escaped not being born that her very existence--like ours--comes to seem a miracle.

Unimaginably rich, invariably swathed in a magnificent purple dressing-gown, Uncle oversees a vast ramshackle castle full of friendly kooks while struggling to fend off the sneak attacks of the incorrigible (and ridiculous) Badfort Crowd. Each Uncle story introduces a new character from Uncle’s madcap world: Signor Guzman, careless keeper of the oil lakes; Noddy Ninety, an elderly train conductor and the oldest student of Dr. Lyre’s Select School for Young Gentlemen; the proprietors of Cheapman’s Store (where motorbikes are a halfpenny each) and Dearman’s Store (where the price of an old milk jug goes up daily); along with many others. But for every delightful friend of Uncle, there is a foe who is no less deliriously wicked. Luckily the misbegotten schemes of the Badfort Crowd are no match for Uncle’s superior wits. Quentin Blake’s quirky illustrations are the perfect complement to J.P. Martin’s stories, each one of a perfect length for bedtime reading.

Ulysses,,Fiction,"Written over a seven-year period, from 1914 to 1921, this book has survived bowdlerization, legal action and controversy. The novel deals with the events of one day in Dublin, 16th June 1904, now known as ""Bloomsday"". The principal characters are Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom and his wife Molly. Ulysses has been labelled dirty, blasphemous and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it not quite obscene enough to disallow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's ""cloacal obsession"". None of these descriptions, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in its own way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, Ulysses is also a compulsively readable book.",,,,2000.0,,,0141182806,9780141182803,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HD3cW0XWvz0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.74,,,,,,,,,933.0,,,1447.0,,,['James Joyce']

De un día para otro, el marido de Rachel vendió sin avisarle la casa en la que vivían y se llevó a los cinco niños al extranjero. Ella tardó un año en volver a verlos, y su pánico era tan intenso que se tambaleaba por la acera a medida que se acercaba a su encuentro. Hace ahora justo veinte años de la ruptura, este preciso fin de semana en que tres de los hijos de Rachel –Ellen y los gemelos Joe y Michael–, ya adultos, cada uno de ellos sumido en su particular crisis personal, se han reunido en la casa materna. Desde aquella separación traumática, a los Kinsella no se les dan bien las despedidas, aunque tampoco las reuniones, en las que los ecos del pasado los desbordan. Inevitablemente, con esos recuerdos tan vivos para Rachel, no es de extrañar que una conversación casual, en el porche, después de cenar, derive en una confesión sobre los acontecimientos que propiciaron aquella ruptura; lo que sin duda ella no espera es que sus hijos tengan también algo que contarle…En Un amor cualquiera, Jane Smiley retoma el universo de las relaciones familiares, centrándose esta vez en el miedo que sentimos a herir de forma irreparable, con nuestras decisiones más íntimas, a aquellos a quienes más amamos. En una narración que se despliega como una espiral de revelaciones emocionales que Rachel va desgranando a lo largo de un fin de semana, Smiley nos muestra las formas en que se desarrollan los amores comunes y corrientes, aquellos que vivimos todos los días, y con exactitud, paciencia y ternura desmonta el mito de la familia perfecta.",,,10/14/89,2020,[],Paperback,,9788417517700,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1589884890l/53443162._SY475_.jpg,3.85,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Fiction (1990)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (1989)']",96.0,1.0,,,,93.0,1469.0,128,Editorial Sexto Piso,"['377', '608', '384', '82', '18']",,[],,"['Jane Smiley', 'Francisco González López']"

Her new husband, Dean Perry, is besotted with her, but his son, Alex, and daughter-in-law Lisa are troubled by how little they know about her. Who is she?

But he’s harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he’s keeping all to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a husband’s attempt to turn an old friend’s wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In “Only Goodness,” a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked stories—a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate—we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome.

Under the Big Black Sun: A Personal History of L.A. Punk,,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Punk', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Rock N Roll', 'Essays', 'Art']","Under the Big Black Sun explores the nascent Los Angeles punk rock movement and its evolution to hardcore punk as it’s never been told before. Authors John Doe and Tom DeSavia have woven together an enthralling story of the legendary west coast scene from 1977-1982 by enlisting the voices of people who were there. The book shares chapter-length tales from the authors along with personal essays from famous (and infamous) players in the scene. Additional authors include: Exene Cervenka (X), Henry Rollins (Black Flag), Mike Watt (The Minutemen), Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey (The Go-Go’s), Dave Alvin (The Blasters), Jack Grisham (TSOL), Teresa Covarrubias (The Brat), Robert Lopez (The Zeros, El Vez), as well as scencesters and journalists Pleasant Gehman, Kristine McKenna, and Chris Morris. Through interstitial commentary, John Doe “narrates” this journey through the land of film noir sunshine, Hollywood back alleys, and suburban sprawl—the place where he met his artistic counterparts Exene, DJ Bonebrake, and Billy Zoom—and formed X, the band that became synonymous with, and in many ways defined, L.A. punk.Under the Big Black Sun shares stories of friendship and love, ambition and feuds, grandiose dreams and cultural rage, all combined with the tattered, glossy sheen of pop culture weirdness that epitomized the operations of Hollywood’s underbelly. Readers will travel to the clubs that defined the scene, as well as to the street corners, empty lots, apartment complexes, and squats that served as de facto salons for the musicians, artists, and fringe players that hashed out what would become punk rock in Los Angeles.",,,,April 26th 2016,[],Hardcover,,9780306824081,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456379376l/25898106.jpg,4.08,['Grammy Award Nominee for Best Spoken Word Album (2017)'],82.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1484.0,277,Da Capo Press,"['513', '633', '280', '53', '5']",,"['Los Angeles, California (United States)']",,"['John Doe', 'Tom Desavia']"

He interweaves the careers of his characters and the events of their time with a narrative verve and breathtaking technical skill that make U.S.A. among the most compulsively readable of modern classics.A startling range of experimental devices captures the textures and background noises of 20th-century life: ""Newsreels"" with blaring headlines; autobiographical ""Camera Eye"" sections with poetic stream-of-consciousness; ""biographies"" evoking emblematic historical figures like J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, John Reed, Frank Lloyd Wright, Thorstein Veblen, and the Unknown Soldier. Holding everything together is sheer storytelling power, tracing dozens of characters from the Spanish-American War to the onset of the Depression.The U.S.A. trilogy is filled with American speech: labor radicals and advertising executives, sailors and stenographers, interior decorators and movie stars. Their crisscrossing destinies take in wars and revolutions, desperate love affairs and harrowing family crises, corrupt public triumphs and private catastrophes, in settings that include the trenches of World War I, insurgent Mexico, Hollywood studios in the silent era, Wall Street boardrooms, and the tumultuous streets of Boston just before the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti.",The U.S.A.

Under the Banner of Heaven,,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Book Club', 'Cults', 'Historical']","A Story of Violent FaithA multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.",,,07/10/03,2004,[],Paperback,,9780330419123,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356441391l/10847.jpg,4.0,['Colorado Book Award for General Nonfiction (2004)'],657.0,11.0,,,,94.0,156956.0,400,Pan MacMillan,"['51785', '65206', '30565', '6638', '2762']",,['Utah (United States)'],,['Jon Krakauer']

The cover has worked and he has caught the eye of a wiry little drug dealer who thinks he might be a useful ally. But undercover and cut off from the support of the woman he loves, Sara Linton, Will finds his demons catching up with him. Although she has no idea where Will has gone, or why, Sara herself has come to Macon because of a cop shooting: Her stepson, Jared, has been gunned down in his own home. Sara holds Lena, Jared’s wife, responsible: Lena, a detective, has been a magnet for trouble all her life, and Jared’s shooting is not the first time someone Sara loved got caught in the crossfire. Furious, Sara finds herself involved in the same case that Will is working without even knowing it, and soon danger is swirling around both of them. In a novel of fierce intensity, shifting allegiances, and shocking twists, two investigations collide with a conspiracy straddling both sides of the law. Karin Slaughter’s latest is both an electrifying thriller and a piercing study of human nature: what happens when good people face the unseen evils in their lives.",Will Trent #7,,05/29/13,July 2nd 2013,"['Sara Linton', 'Lena Adams', 'Will Trent', 'Jared Long']",Hardcover,,9780345539472,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361517437l/16071767.jpg,4.19,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Mystery & Thriller (2013)'],250.0,3.0,,,,97.0,27566.0,379,Delacorte Press,"['11025', '11624', '4188', '581', '148']",,"['Macon, Georgia (United States)']",,['Karin Slaughter']

  In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.
On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.",,,,11/16/10,"['Louie Zamperini', 'Russell Allen Phillips', 'Pete Zamperini', 'Stanley Pillsbury', 'Harry Brooks', 'Payton Jordan', 'Anthony Zamperini', 'Louise Zamperini', 'Francis McNamara (Mac)', 'William Harris', 'Fred Garrett', 'Frank Tinker', 'Thorbjørn Christiansen', 'Sylvia Zamperini Flammer', 'Virginia Zamperini', 'Lynn Moody', 'Cecy Perry', 'Cynthia Zamperini (Applewhite)', 'Harry Read', 'Yukichi Kano']",Hardcover,,9781400064168,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115l/8664353.jpg,4.36,"['Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography (2010)', ""Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Young Adults (2014)"", 'Indies Choice Book Award for Nonfiction (2011)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for NonFiction (2011)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2015)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)']",24200.0,290.0,,,,95.0,767063.0,492,Random House,"['452057', '202821', '71163', '21654', '19368']",,[],,['Laura Hillenbrand']

Rising out of the stony canyons of Nevada, Utopia is a world on the cutting edge of technology. A theme park attracting 65,000 visitors each day, its dazzling array of robots and futuristic holograms make it a worldwide sensation. But ominous mishaps are beginning to disrupt the once flawless technology. A friendly robot goes haywire, causing panic, and a popular roller coaster malfunctions, nearly killing a teenaged rider. Dr. Andrew Warne, the brilliant computer engineer who designed much of the park’s robotics, is summoned from the East Coast to get things back on track.On the day Warne arrives, however, Utopia is caught in the grip of something far more sinister. A group of ruthless criminals has infiltrated the park’s computerized infrastructure, giving them complete access to all of Utopia’s attractions and systems. Their communication begins with a simple and dire warning: If their demands are met, none of the 65,000 people in the park that day will ever know they were there; if not, chaos will descend, and every man, woman, and child will become a target. As one of the brains behind Utopia, Warne finds himself thrust into a role he never imagined–trying to save the lives of thousands of innocent people. And as the minutes tick away, Warne’s struggle to outsmart his opponents grows ever more urgent, for his only daughter is among the unsuspecting crowds in the park.Lincoln Child evokes the technological wonders of Utopia with such skill and precision it is hard to believe the park exists only in the pages of this extraordinary book.

Untangled: Guiding Teenage Girls Through the Seven Transitions into Adulthood,,"['Parenting', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Family', 'Education', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Feminism', 'Childrens']","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Lisa Damour, Ph.D., director of the internationally renowned Laurel School’s Center for Research on Girls, pulls back the curtain on the teenage years and shows why your daughter’s erratic and confusing behavior is actually healthy, necessary, and natural. Untangled explains what’s going on, prepares parents for what’s to come, and lets them know when it’s time to worry. In this sane, highly engaging, and informed guide for parents of daughters, Dr. Damour draws on decades of experience and the latest research to reveal the seven distinct—and absolutely normal—developmental transitions that turn girls into grown-ups, including Parting with Childhood, Contending with Adult Authority, Entering the Romantic World, and Caring for Herself. Providing realistic scenarios and welcome advice on how to engage daughters in smart, constructive ways, Untangled gives parents a broad framework for understanding their daughters while addressing their most common questions, including • My thirteen-year-old rolls her eyes when I try to talk to her, and only does it more when I get angry with her about it. How should I respond? • Do I tell my teen daughter that I’m checking her phone? • My daughter suffers from test anxiety. What can I do to help her? • Where’s the line between healthy eating and having an eating disorder? • My teenage daughter wants to know why I’m against pot when it’s legal in some states. What should I say? • My daughter’s friend is cutting herself. Do I call the girl’s mother to let her know?  Perhaps most important, Untangled helps mothers and fathers understand, connect, and grow with their daughters. When parents know what makes their daughter tick, they can embrace and enjoy the challenge of raising a healthy, happy young woman.Praise for Untangled“Finally, there’s some good news for puzzled parents of adolescent girls, and psychologist Lisa Damour is the bearer of that happy news. [Untangled] is the most down-to-earth, readable parenting book I’ve come across in a long time.”—The Washington Post “Anna Freud wrote in 1958, ‘There are few situations in life which are more difficult to cope with than an adolescent son or daughter during the attempt to liberate themselves.’ In the intervening decades, the transition doesn’t appear to have gotten any easier which makes Untangled such a welcome new resource.”—The Boston Globe “Damour offers a hopeful, helpful new way for parents to talk about—and with—teenage girls. . . . Parents will want this book on their shelves, next to established classics of the genre.”—Publishers Weekly“For years people have been asking me for the ‘girl equivalent of Raising Cain,’ and I haven't known exactly what to recommend. Now I do.”—Michael Thompson, Ph.D., co-author of Raising Cain “An essential guide to understanding and supporting girls throughout their development. It’s obvious that Dr. Damour ‘gets’ girls and understands the best way for any adult to help them navigate the common yet difficult challenges so many girls face.”—Rosalind Wiseman, author of Queen Bees & Wannabes “A gem. From the moment I read the last page I’ve been recommending it to my clients (including those with sons!) and colleagues, and using it as a refreshing guide in my own work with teenagers and their parents.”—Wendy Mogel, Ph.D., author of The Blessing of a Skinned Knee",,,02/02/16,February 9th 2016,[],Hardcover,,9780553393057,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453058988l/25614847.jpg,4.49,[],62.0,1.0,,,,99.0,6706.0,352,Ballantine Books,"['3941', '2225', '465', '60', '15']",,[],,['Lisa Damour']

But Coin sees Eric's heir as a threat to be eliminated by any means -- magical or mundane -- so Jayné had better start believing in something to save her own life.  Aided in her mission by a group of unlikely companions -- Aubrey, Eric's devastatingly attractive assistant; Ex, a former Jesuit with a lethal agenda; Midian, a two-hundred-year-old man who claims to be under a curse from Randolph Coin himself; and Chogyi Jake, a self-styled Buddhist with mystical abilities -- Jayné finds that her new reality is not only unexpected, but often unexplainable. And if she hopes to survive, she'll have to learn the new rules fast -- or break them completely....",The Black Sun's Daughter #1,,,December 2nd 2008,"['Aubrey', 'Jayné Heller', 'Midian Clark', 'Ex', 'Chogyi Jake']",Paperback,,9781416575979,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1322122858l/4476999.jpg,3.53,[],99.0,1.0,,,,85.0,5076.0,357,Pocket Books,"['1028', '1630', '1640', '554', '224']",,"['Denver, Colorado (United States)']",,['M.

It’s chaotic, ruthless, and tragic. This story takes love and kills its innocence, steals away the pure moments, and crushes the hearts of the broken. A story born in childhood, tying one girl to one boy, leads to a destructive path—that hurts more than it doesn’t, that shatters more than it heals—testing the love that binds the two through a lifetime. Tegen Matthews is the daughter of Dorothy Kelley, a club whore in the Hell’s Horsemen. A plain little girl, Tegen falls into the gritty world of the motorcycle club. When she meets a sweet, caring boy, she embraces the warmth and affection he shows her. Cage West is the son of the president of the Hell’s Horsemen. Tall and blond with deep brown eyes, as he grows up Cage realizes the power of his dimpled smile and smooth drawl. With one chance encounter, Tegen becomes forever tied to Cage. Following is a wayward journey that is filled with regrets, mistakes, and heartache, pulling at the threads that hold them together. Cage and Tegen fight hard but love harder, and in the end, what matters is where the journey takes one girl and one boy, who have been twined with one another since the beginning. This is Tegen and Cage’s story. Love doesn’t erase a broken heart, and it sure doesn’t change people.

Un altro scrivere: lettere 1904-1924,,[],"Kafka e Max Brod si conobbero, non ancora ventenni, nel 1902. Da quel primo incontro nacque un'amicizia che durò fino alla morte di Kafka nel 1924. Fu un rapporto asimmetrico: da un lato un intellettuale -Brod- che andava riscuotendo un crescente successo fino ad apparire agli occhi dei suoi contemporanei una figura di prima grandezza nella cultura praghese di lingua tedesca, dall'altro uno scrittore che viveva con un misto di vergogna ed orgogliosa consapevolezza il proprio straordinario talento. Fu, però, anche un rapporto decisivo per la vita e l'esistenza postuma di entrambi. Senza Kafka, il nome di Brod sarebbe oggi noto solo a pochi specialisti. Senza Brod, l'opera di Kafka ci sarebbe giunta dimezzata: fu infatti lui a tradire, con provvida infedeltà, le volontà testamentarie dell'amico, che gli aveva chiesto di distruggere tutte le sue carte.Le lettere qui raccolte insieme per la prima volta non soltanto documentano con insolita vivezza questa amicizia, ma forniscono anche una chiave preziosa per l'opera e per la biografia di uno dei massimi scrittori del XX secolo. La vita di Kafka non ci appare qui, secondo uno stereotipo che lo stesso Brod ha contribuito a diffondere, come quella di un santo, ma sotto il segno dell'ironia e della leggerezza. In un fitto intreccio di confidenze, aneddoti, riflessioni, Kafka condivide con Brod ogni aspetto della sua esistenza, dalla composizione dei romanzi fino alle sue tormentate storie d'amore. Nelle reciproche incomprensioni, nelle differenze nel modo di guardare alla vita e alla scrittura, la disparità fra i due autori affiora di continuo, tanto che davvero potrebbe sembrare, come osservò una volta Walter Benjamin, che Kafka abbia voluto porre con questa amicizia un punto di domanda accanto alla sua vita. Ma tanto più grande è la tensione che separa queste due esistenze, tanto più luminose le scintille che il genio di Kafka sa farne scaturire. E l'amicizia con Brod è anche il luogo dove poteva manifestarsi un affetto che, come Kafka scrive a Felice Bauer, «ha le sue radici nel profondo, laggiù dove la letteratura ancora non c'è, in quanto vi è di più umano».",,La quarta prosa,,April 5th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9788854500952,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349189511l/16060850.jpg,5.0,[],100.0,1.0,,,,100.0,1.0,448,Neri Pozza,[],,[],,"['Max Brod', 'Franz Kafka', 'Marco Rispoli', 'Luca Zenobi']"

Heinlein Award-winning SF writer Michael Flynn returns to space opera with Up Jim River. There is a river on Dangchao Waypoint, a small world out beyond Die Bold. It is a longish river as such things go, with a multitude of bayous and rapids and waterfalls, and it runs through many a strange and hostile country. Going up it, you can lose everything.Going up it, you can find anything. The Hound Bridget ban has vanished and her employer, the Kennel (the mysterious superspy agency of the League) has given up the search. But her daughter, the harper Mearana, has not. She enlists the scarred man, Donovan, to aid her in her search. With the reluctant assent and financial aid of the Kennel, they set forth. Bridget ban was following hints of an artifact that would “protect the League from the Confederacy for aye.” Mearana is eager to follow that trail, but Donovan is reluctant, because whatever is at the end of it made a Hound disappear. What it would do to a harper and a drunk is far too easy to imagine. Donovan’s mind had been shattered by Those of Name, the rulers of the Confederacy, and no fewer than seven quarreling personalities now inhabit his skull. How can he hope to see her through safely?

Ulysses S. Grant,The Unlikely Hero,Biography & Autobiography,"One of the first two volumes in Harper's Eminent Lives series, Korda brings his acclaimed storytelling talents to the life of Ulysses S. Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant's character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant's life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general's tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant's presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general's second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even–handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history.",,,,2004.0,,,0060590157,9780060590154,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rvaqxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.88,,,,,,,,,176.0,,,410.0,,,['Michael Korda']

She, herself, is tiny-like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. She has a remarkable face and wears the thickest corrective lenses anyone has ever seen. Her posture is suggestive of some spinal problem. Her breasts are perfect; perhaps implants. She is strangely erotic yet somehow grotesque, vulnerable yet threatening. Her hitchhikers are a mixed bunch of men-trailer trash and travelling postgrads, thugs and philosophers. But Isserley is only interested in whether they have families and whether they have muscles. Then, it's only a question of how long she can endure her pain--physical and spiritual--and their conversation. Michel Faber's work has been described as a combination of Roald Dahl and Franz Kafka, as Somerset Maugham shacking up with Ian McEwan.

Untouchables,My Family's Triumphant Journey Out of the Caste System in Modern India,Biography & Autobiography,"Every sixth human being in the world today is an Indian, and every sixth Indian is an untouchable. For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. In Untouchables, Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents -- their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables -- the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. Compelling and deeply compassionate, Untouchables is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today.",,,,2005.0,,,0743270797,9780743270793,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k9hfQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.82,,,,,,,,,320.0,,,299.0,,,['Narendra Jadhav']

Ridding society of troublesome teens while simltaneously providing much-needed tissues for transplant might be convenient, but its morality has finally been brought into question.

A futuristic Frankenstein, Cam struggles with a search for identity and meaning and wonders if a rewound being can have a soul.

Noam Chomsky is universally accepted as one of the preeminent public intellectuals of the modern era. Over the past thirty years, broadly diverse audiences have gathered to attend his sold-out lectures. Now, in Understanding Power, Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel have assembled the best of Chomsky's recent talks on the past, present, and future of the politics of power. In a series of enlightening and wide-ranging discussions, all published here for the first time, Chomsky radically reinterprets the events of the past three decades, covering topics from foreign policy during Vietnam to the decline of welfare under the Clinton administration. And as he elucidates the connection between America's imperialistic foreign policy and the decline of domestic social services, Chomsky also discerns the necessary steps to take toward social change. With an eye to political activism and the media's role in popular struggle, as well as U.S. foreign and domestic policy, Understanding Power offers a sweeping critique of the world around us and is definitive Chomsky.

Is a serial butcher loose in Virginia? That's what the panicked public thinks, thanks to a local TV reporter who got the leaked news from her boyfriend, Scarpetta's vile rival, Investigator Percy Ring. But the butchered bodies are so many red herrings intended to throw idiots like Ring off the track. Instead of a run-of-the-mill serial killer, we're dealing with a shadowy figure who has plans involving mutant smallpox, mass murder, and messing with Scarpetta's mind by e-mailing her gory photos of the murder scenes, along with cryptic AOL chat-room messages. The coolest innovation: Scarpetta's gorgeous genius niece, Lucy, equips her with a DataGlove and a VPL Eyephone, and she takes a creepy virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene.Unnatural Exposure boasts brisk storytelling, crackling dialogue, evocative prose about forensic-science sleuthing, and crisp character sketches, both of familiar characters like Scarpetta's gruff partner Pete Marino and bit players like the landfill employee falsely accused by Ring. Plus, let's face it: serial killers are old hat. Cornwell's most vivid villains are highly plausible backstabbing colleagues like Ring, who plots to destroy Lucy's FBI career by outing her as a lesbian. Some readers object to the rather abrupt ending, but, hey, it's less jarring than Hannibal's, and it's the logical culmination of Cornwell's philosophy about human nature. To illuminate the novel's finale, read Cornwell's remarks on paranoia in her Amazon.com interview. --Tim Appelo",Kay Scarpetta #8,,08/06/97,2000,"['Kay Scarpetta', 'Pete Marino', 'Lucy Farinelli', 'Benton Wesley', 'Keith Pleasants', 'Inspector Percy Ring']",Paperback,,9780751530490,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383293921l/232145.jpg,4.06,[],70.0,1.0,,,,96.0,53733.0,370,Time Warner,"['19359', '20843', '11558', '1590', '383']",,"['United States of America', 'Richmond, Virginia (United States)']",,['Patricia Cornwell']

With United as One, this action-packed series comes to a surprising, breathtaking, and utterly satisfying conclusion. The Garde didn’t start this war, but they’ll do whatever it takes to end it once and for all. . . . The Mogadorians have invaded Earth. Their warships loom over our most populated cities, and no country will risk taking them head on. The Garde are all that stand in the way, but they’ll need an army of their own to win this fight. They’ve teamed up with the US military, but it might not be enough. The Garde need reinforcements, and they’ve found them in the most unexpected place. Teenagers from across the globe, like John Smith’s best friend, Sam, have developed abilities. So John and the others must get to them before the Mogs, because if they don’t their enemies will use these gifted teens for their own sinister plan. But after all the Mogadorians have taken from John—his home, his family, his friends, and the person he loves most—he might not want to put any more lives in danger. He’s got nothing left to lose, and he’s just discovered he has been given an incredible new Legacy. Now he can turn himself into the ultimate weapon.

Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'LGBT', 'Mental Health', 'Biography Memoir', 'Mental Illness', 'Psychology', 'Queer']","“I didn’t decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .” Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying. In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn’t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point. Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder. From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues. In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",,,,November 1st 2010,[],Paperback,,9781439177808,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1292739170l/9219901.jpg,3.84,['Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2010)'],98.0,1.0,,,,91.0,37743.0,320,Atria Books,"['11128', '13852', '9204', '2548', '1011']",,[],,['Portia de Rossi']

Did he, in other words, diminish beauty? Far from it, says acclaimed scientist Richard Dawkins; Newton's unweaving is the key to much of modern astronomy and to the breathtaking poetry of modern cosmology. Mysteries don't lose their poetry because they are solved: the solution often is more beautiful than the puzzle, uncovering deeper mysteries. With the wit, insight, and spellbinding prose that have made him a best-selling author, Dawkins takes up the most important and compelling topics in modern science, from astronomy and genetics to language and virtual reality, combining them in a landmark statement of the human appetite for wonder.

In Underland, he delivers his masterpiece: an epic exploration of the Earth’s underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself.In this highly anticipated sequel to his international bestseller The Old Ways, Macfarlane takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind. Traveling through “deep time”—the dizzying expanses of geologic time that stretch away from the present—he moves from the birth of the universe to a post-human future, from the prehistoric art of Norwegian sea caves to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, from Bronze Age funeral chambers to the catacomb labyrinth below Paris, and from the underground fungal networks through which trees communicate to a deep-sunk “hiding place” where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come. Woven through Macfarlane’s own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls “the awful darkness within the world.”Global in its geography and written with great lyricism and power, Underland speaks powerfully to our present moment. Taking a deep-time view of our planet, Macfarlane here asks a vital and unsettling question: “Are we being good ancestors to the future Earth?” Underland marks a new turn in Macfarlane’s long-term mapping of the relations of landscape and the human heart. From its remarkable opening pages to its deeply moving conclusion, it is a journey into wonder, loss, fear, and hope.

Unseen: The Gift of Being Hidden in a World That Loves to Be Noticed,,"['Christian', 'Nonfiction', 'Faith', 'Christian Living', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Christian Non Fiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development']","How do we find contentment in God when we feel so hidden?
  Sara Hagerty unfolds the truths found in the biblical story of Mary of Bethany to discover the scandalous love of God and explore the spiritual richness of being hidden in him.
Every heart longs to be seen and understood. Yet most of our lives is unwitnessed. We spend our days working, driving, parenting. We sometimes spend whole seasons feeling unnoticed and unappreciated.In Unseen, Sara Hagerty suggests that this is exactly what God intended. He is the only One who truly knows us. He is the only One who understands the value of the unseen in our lives. When this truth seeps into our souls, we realize that only when we hide ourselves in God can we give ourselves to others in true freedom--and know the joy of a deeper relationship with the God who sees us.Our culture applauds what we can produce, what we can show, what we can upload to social media. Only when we give all of ourselves to God--unedited, abandoned, apparently wasteful in its lack of productivity--can we live out who God created us to be. As Hagerty writes, ""Maybe my seemingly unproductive, looking-up-at-Him life produces awe among the angels.""Through an eloquent exploration of both personal and biblical story, Hagerty calls us to offer every unseen minute of our lives to God. God is in the secret places of our lives that no one else witnesses. But we've not been relegated to these places. We've been invited.We may be ""wasting"" ourselves in a hidden corner today: The cubicle on the fourth floor. The hospital bedside of an elderly parent. The laundry room. But these are the places God uses to meet us with a radical love. These are the places that produce the kind of unhinged love in us that gives everything at His feet, whether or not anyone else ever proclaims our name, whether or not anyone else ever sees.God's invitation is not just for a season or a day. It is the question of our lives: ""When no one else applauds you, when it makes no sense, when you see no results--will you waste your love on Me?""",,,,August 29th 2017,[],Hardcover,,9780310339977,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494544701l/33098666._SY475_.jpg,4.36,[],98.0,1.0,,,,97.0,1501.0,240,Zondervan,"['823', '452', '181', '38', '7']",,[],,['Sara Hagerty']

When he meets her again two years later, he begins to believe in fate. But, as he prepares for a potential shot at a championship fight, there’s not time in his life or career for a woman.  Shane fights his inner demons by using his fists. On the street or in the ring, Shane does what he does best, he wins at any cost. Unlike Kace, Shane can’t seem to lose.

A remote uncharted island halfway around the world seemed like a perfectly logical place to get away from it all. Calia Reed wasn't part of Owen's plans.

Just a high school graduate, she knows she can’t compete with other girls in the interview room, with their glossy degrees, glamorous appearances and polished looks. Clad in a long ‘chaadar’ and sporting a makeup-free face, Romaisa knows she is a misfit. Till she is spotted by the Prince Charming. Nabeel Sikandar, the knight in shining armor for Romaisa, hires her instantly as his secretary. Besotted with her, he marries her just after a month, against all odds.

Widowed after few short months of marriage, Romaisa soon realizes how her life before Nabeel wasn’t half as bad. Humiliated, insulted, rejected and tortured, Romaisa passively endures, keeping her little daughter as her connection to sanity.

Born in a rural village in 1940, Wangari Maathai was already an iconoclast as a child, determined to get an education even though most girls were uneducated. We see her studying with Catholic missionaries, earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the United States, and becoming the first woman both to earn a PhD in East and Central Africa and to head a university department in Kenya. We witness her numerous run-ins with the brutal Moi government. She makes clear the political and personal reasons that compelled her, in 1977, to establish the Green Belt Movement, which spread from Kenya across Africa and which helps restore indigenous forests while assisting rural women by paying them to plant trees in their villages. We see how Maathai’s extraordinary courage and determination helped transform Kenya’s government into the democracy in which she now serves as assistant minister for the environment and as a member of Parliament.

Up and Down California in 1860-1864: The Journal of William H. Brewer,,"['History', 'Travel', 'Nonfiction']","In 1860 William Brewer, a young Yale-educated teacher of the natural sciences and a recent widower, eagerly accepted an offer from Josiah Whitney to assist in the first geological survey of the state of California. Brewer was not a geologist, but his training in agriculture and botany made him an invaluable member of the team. He traveled more than fourteen thousand miles in the four years he spent in California and spent much of his leisure time writing lively, detailed letters to his brother back East. These warmly affectionate letters, presented here in their entirety, describe the new state in all its spectacular beauty and paint a vivid picture of California in the mid-nineteenth century.

Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work - until now.
  Universal Principles of Design
 is the first cross-disciplinary reference of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, this book pairs clear explanations of the design concepts featured with visual examples of those concepts applied in practice. From the 80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, 100 design concepts are defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge.This landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.",,,,October 1st 2003,[],Hardcover,,9781592530076,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328754391l/130730.jpg,4.15,[],197.0,2.0,,,,94.0,5191.0,216,Rockport Publishers,"['2309', '1742', '823', '222', '95']",,[],,"['William Lidwell', 'Jill Butler', 'Kritina Holden']"
Under and Alone: The True Story of the Undercover Agent Who Infiltrated America's Most Violent Outlaw Motorcycle Gang,,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Motorcycle', 'Autobiography', 'History']","In 1998, William Queen was a veteran law enforcement agent with a lifelong love of motorcycles and a lack of patience with paperwork. When a ""confidential informant"" made contact with his boss at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, offering to take an agent inside the San Fernando chapter of the Mongols (the scourge of Southern California, and one of the most dangerous gangs in America), Queen jumped at the chance, not realizing that he was kicking-starting the most extensive undercover operation inside an outlaw motorcycle gang in the history of American law enforcement.Nor did Queen suspect that he would penetrate the gang so successfully that he would become a fully ""patched-in"" member, eventually rising through their ranks to the office of treasurer, where he had unprecedented access to evidence of their criminal activity. After Queen spent twenty-eight months as ""Billy St. John,"" the bearded, beer-swilling, Harley-riding gang-banger, the truth of his identity became blurry, even to himself.During his initial ""prospecting"" phase, Queen was at the mercy of crank-fueled criminal psychopaths who sought to have him test his mettle and prove his fealty by any means necessary, from selling (and doing) drugs, to arms trafficking, stealing motorcycles, driving getaway cars, and, in one shocking instance, stitching up the face of a Mongol ""ol' lady"" after a particularly brutal beating at the hands of her boyfriend.Yet despite the constant criminality of the gang, for whom planning cop killings and gang rapes were business as usual, Queen also came to see the genuine camaraderie they shared. When his lengthy undercover work totally isolated Queen from family, his friends, and ATF colleagues, the Mongols felt like the only family he had left. ""I had no doubt these guys genuinely loved Billy St. John and would have laid down their lives for him. But they wouldn't hesitate to murder Billy Queen.""From Queen's first sleight of hand with a line of methamphetamine in front of him and a knife at his throat, to the fearsome face-off with their decades-old enemy, the Hell's Angels (a brawl that left three bikers dead), to the heartbreaking scene of a father ostracized at Parents' Night because his deranged-outlaw appearance precluded any interaction with regular citizens, Under and Alone is a breathless, adrenaline-charged read that puts you on the street with some of the most dangerous men in America and with the law enforcement agents who risk everything to bring them in.",,,11/06/05,March 28th 2006,[],Paperback,,9780345487520,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320416108l/104522.jpg,4.12,[],65.0,2.0,,,,97.0,4238.0,260,Fawcett Books,"['1587', '1739', '786', '103', '23']",,[],,['William Queen']
