U.L. Harper (Goodreads Author),In Blackness (Book 1),,English,,"The truth of our bloody future will reveal itself…in blackness.Lenny and Saline are merely kids when their parents move them in with, Busek, an old family friend they’ve never met. A few months later their parents are dead and they’re left alone to cope in the small town of San Pedro. It doesn’t help that Busek beats his son, Dustin, and doesn’t seem to care for them.Flash forward almost a decade. Although the three kids are now young adults and good enough friends, they’ve each found their own way to deal with their situation.Saline has hidden the fact for years that she’s Born Again Christian. Ironically, a group of Christians offers her a chance to visit her old hometown for a supposed religious gathering. But it’s not who is gathering there that sends her running for her life but rather what is gathering.Suddenly feeling the same pull towards their old town as his sister, Lenny follows Saline. On his travels he discovers the truth about his urge to be there and why that might mean the end of him.Back home, Dustin immerses himself in the intricacies of San Pedro. He and local anarchists are on the frontlines of an odd discovery, which on the outset seems like simple yet awkward workings of the city council. Instead they’ve stumbled upon an event that will change the world as we know it.In Blackness is the predecessor to In Blackness: The Reinvention of Man, the second installment of three books chronicling the alien apocalypse.",,,06/18/11,July 1st 2011,[],Paperback,['Horror'],,9781614344384,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311386292l/12086913.jpg,3.67,[],100.0,1.0,,12086913-in-blackness,,,,,81.0,36.0,286,,Booklocker.com,"['9', '15', '5', '5', '2']",,,[],,
"U.R. Ananthamurthy, A.K. Ramanujan (Translator)",Samskara: A Rite for a Dead Man,,English,,"Made into a powerful, award-winning film in 1970, this important Kannada novel of the sixties has received widespread acclaim from both critics and general readers since its first publication in 1965. As a religious novel about a decaying brahmin colony in the south Indian village of Karnataka, Samskara serves as an allegory rich in realistic detail, a contemporary reworking of ancient Hindu themes and myths, and a serious, poetic study of a religious man living in a community of priests gone to seed. A death which stands as the central event in the plot brings in its wake a plague, many more deaths, live questions with only dead answers, moral chaos, and the rebirth of one man. The volume provides a useful glossary of Hindu myths, customs, Indian names, flora, and other terms.

As Roberto explores the different cabinets in the hold, he remembers chapters from his youth: Ferrante, his imaginary evil brother; the siege of Casale, that meaningless chess move in the Thirty Years' War in which he lost his father and his illusions; and the lessons given him on Reasons of State, fencing, the writing of love letters, and blasphemy.In this fascinating, lyrical tale, Umberto Eco tells of a young dreamer searching for love and meaning; and of a most amazing old Jesuit who, with his clocks and maps, has plumbed the secrets of longitudes, the four moons of Jupiter, and the Flood.",,,09/28/94,June 5th 2006,"['Roberto della Griva', 'Roberto de la Grive', 'Tycho Brahe', 'Monsieur Gaffarel', 'Arthénice', 'Escondida', 'Marquis de Cinq-Mars', 'Monsieur de Saint-Savin', 'Monsieur de Toiras']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Italian Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Italy']",,9780156030373,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435151040l/10506._SY475_.jpg,3.47,[],330.0,4.0,,10506.The_Island_of_the_Day_Before,,,,,83.0,13689.0,528,,Mariner Books,"['2522', '4344', '4484', '1747', '592']",,,[],,

Umberto Eco,On Ugliness,,English,,"In the mold of his acclaimed ""History of Beauty,"" renowned cultural critic Umberto Eco's ""On Ugliness"" is an exploration of the monstrous and the repellant in visual culture and the arts. What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder?Eco's encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly, revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we're most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton's Satan to Goethe's Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs, hermits, and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky, kitsch, and camp, and the aesthetics of excess and vice. With abundant examples of painting and sculpture ranging from ancient Greek amphorae to Bosch, Brueghel, and Goya among others, and with quotations from the most celebrated writers and philosophers of each age, this provocative discussion explores in-depth the concepts of evil, depravity, and darkness in art and literature.",,,10/29/07,October 30th 2007,[],Hardcover,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'History', 'Art History', 'Essays', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Reference', 'Historical']",,9780847829866,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320443510l/520738.jpg,3.85,[],235.0,4.0,,520738.On_Ugliness,,,,,85.0,17626.0,456,,Rizzoli International Publications,"['6927', '4811', '3326', '1380', '1182']",,,[],,

Blogs, tweets and newspaper articles appear daily on the subject, many of them repetitive, most of them admitting they don't know what will happen. Amidst the twittering, the thoughts of Jean-Claude Carrière and Umberto Eco come as a breath of fresh air. There are few people better placed to discuss the past, present and future of the book. Both of them avid book collectors with a deep understanding of history, they have explored through their work, both written and visual, the many and varied ways in which ideas have been represented through the ages.This beautifully produced book, an object of desire in itself, is the transcription of a long conversation between the two men in which they discuss a vast range of subjects, from what can be defined as the first book, to the idea of the library, the burning of books both accidental and deliberate, and what will happen to knowledge and memory when infinite amounts of information are available at the click of a mouse. En route there are delightful digressions into personal anecdote about everything from Eco's first computer to the book Carrière is most sad to have sold.Readers will close this book feeling that they have had the privilege of eavesdropping on an intimate discussion between two great minds. And while, as Carrière says, the one certain thing about the future is that it is unpredictable, it is clear from this conversation that, in some form or other, the book will survive.

Umberto Galimberti,L'ospite inquietante. Il nichilismo e i giovani,,Italian,,"Un libro sui giovani, perché i giovani, anche se non sempre lo sanno, stanno male. E non per le solite crisi esistenziali che costellano la giovinezza, ma perché un ospite inquietante, il nichilismo, si aggira tra loro, penetra nei loro sentimenti, confonde i loro pensieri, cancella prospettive e orizzonti, fiacca la loro anima, intristisce le passioni rendendole esangui. Le famiglie si allarmano, la scuola non sa più cosa fare. Solo il mercato si interessa di loro per condurli sulle vie del divertimento e del consumo, dove ciò che si consuma è la loro stessa vita, che più non riesce a proiettarsi in un futuro capace di far intravedere una qualche promessa. Va da sé che, se il disagio non è del singolo individuo, l'origine non è psicologica ma culturale. Perciò inefficaci appaiono i rimedi elaborati dalla nostra cultura, sia nella versione religiosa perché Dio è davvero morto, sia nella versione illuminista perché non sembra che la ragione sia oggi il regolatore dei rapporti tra gli uomini. Resta solo la 'ragione strumentale' che garantisce il progresso tecnico, ma non un ampliamento dell'orizzonte di senso per la latitanza del pensiero e l'aridità del sentimento. C'è una via d'uscita? Si può mettere alla porta l'ospite inquietante? Sì, se sapremo insegnare ai giovani l''arte del vivere', come dicevano i Greci, che consiste nel riconoscere le proprie capacità e nell'esplicitarle e vederle fiorire secondo misura.

Unica Zürn,The Man of Jasmine & Other Texts,,English,,"In 1970, Unica Zurn, the companion and lover of the Surrealist artist Hans Bellmer, threw herself from the sixth floor window of their apartment in Paris. Her suicide was the culmination of thirteen years of mental crises which are described with disarming, honest lucidity in 'The Man Of Jasmine', subtitled Impressions from a Mental Illness. Zurn's mental collapse was initiated when she encountered in the real world her childhood fantasy figure ""the man of jasmine"": he was the writer Henri Michaux, and her meeting him plunged her into a world of hallucination in which visions of her desires, anxieties and events from her unresolved past simply overwhelmed her present life. Her return to ""reality"" was constantly interrupted by alternate visionary and depressive periods. Zurn's compelling narrative also reveals her uneasy relationship with words and language, which she attempted to resolve by the compulsive writing of anagrams. Anagrams allowed her to dissect the language of everyday, to personalise it, and to make it reveal hidden at its core astonishing messages, threats and evocations. They formed the basis of her interpretation of the split between her inner & outer lives and underpin the texts included in this selection. The Man of Jasmine is certainly one of the greatest descriptions of mental collapse, but it is much more. Zurn's familiarity with Surrealist conceptions of the psyche, and her extraordinary self-possession during the most alarming experiences are allied to vivid descriptive powers which make this a literary as well as a psychological masterpiece.",,,01/01/71,December 1st 1994,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Womens', 'France']",,9780947757809,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1174843391l/445155.jpg,4.28,[],67.0,1.0,,445155.The_Man_of_Jasmine_Other_Texts,,,,,95.0,267.0,202,,Serpent's Tail,"['130', '99', '25', '10', '3']",,,[],,

Dark Spring is the story of a young girl's simultaneous introduction to sexuality and mental illness, revealing a different aspect of the ""mad love"" so romanticized by the (predominantly male) Surrealists. Unica Zurn (1916-1970) emigrated in 1953 from her native Berlin to Paris in order to live with the artist Hans Bellmer. There she exhibited drawings as a member of the Surrealist group and collaborated with Bellmer on a series of notorious photographs of her nude torso bound with string.

"Ursula K. Le Guin, David Naimon, Núria Molines Galarza (Translator)",Conversaciones sobre la escritura,,Spanish,,"Poco antes de fallecer en enero de 2018, Ursula K. Le Guin mantuvo una serie de conversaciones con su amigo David Naimon sobre el acto más profundo e íntimo que puede llevar a cabo una mente creativa: el de escribir. Es a través del ejercicio de la escritura, que se alimenta del poder de la imaginación, como transmitimos las mejores historias. Naimon y Le Guin planeaban reunir sus charlas en un libro que funcionara como un diálogo amistoso sobre el placer de imaginar y la vocación de escribir, dirigido a todo aquel que quisiera indagar en el misterio de la creación. Para Ursula fue su última obra –aunque no pudo revisarlo por completo, sí llegó a supervisar una buena parte del texto–, y para David Naimon el cumplimiento de un sueño: había accedido a la sabiduría de la mejor escritora americana de ciencia ficción y fantasía del siglo XX, y con este libro la podía compartir con el resto del mundo.Estas conversaciones sobre la escritura están divididas en tres bloques temáticos: el primero sobre la narrativa o la ficción (el oficio de escribir, la estética del texto, la filosofía que se filtra en la ficción de obras mayores como La mano izquierda de la oscuridad o las novelas del ciclo de Terramar), el segundo sobre la poesía y el componente lírico de la prosa de Le Guin y, finalmente, sobre su acercamiento productivo y caudaloso al género del ensayo y la crítica literaria. Cada forma de escribir tiene su método, su oficio y su misterio, y de manera tan amena como cándida la autora comparte su visión sobre ese fuego invisible que mantiene la imaginación siempre activa. Además, el libro se convierte en un breviario de observaciones lúcidas sobre temas tan diversos como las guerras culturales, el papel de la mujer en la literatura, la presencia de la naturaleza en las historias de Le Guin, y una sólida defensa del género fantástico. Todo ello hace que este testamento del pensamiento de Le Guin funcione también como un valioso manual de inspiración y motivación para una vida atenta y creativa.",,,04/03/18,January 27th 2020,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'Books About Books', 'Poetry', 'Literary Criticism', 'Feminism', 'Criticism', 'Womens', 'Crafts']",,9788412073843,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579716714l/50627133._SY475_.jpg,4.25,"['Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work (2019)', 'Locus Award for Non-Fiction (2019)']",95.0,1.0,,50627133-conversaciones-sobre-la-escritura,,,,,98.0,932.0,104,,Alpha Decay,"['408', '368', '139', '16', '1']",,,[],,

The fifth novel and sixth book of the Earthsea Cycle is The Other Wind. The sorcerer Alder has the power of mending, but it may have become the power of destruction: every night he dreams of the wall between the land of the living and the land of the dead, and the wall is being dismantled. If the wall is breached, the dead will invade Earthsea. Ged, once Archmage of Earthsea, sends Alder to King Lebannen. Now Alder and the king must join with a burned woman, a wizard of forbidden lore, and a being who is woman and dragon both, in an impossible quest to save Earthsea. Ursula K.

"Uschi Obermaier, Natalia Avelon (Sprecher)",High Times,,,,"Sie war die weibliche Ikone der 68er-Bewegung, dazu Model, Muse, Groupie, Lebenshungrige. Das Bett teilte sie mit Mick Jagger und Keith Richards, kaum eine Droge hat sie ausgelassen -- sie stand für die neue, freizügige Weiblichkeit, die alles konnte und alles machte. In High Times schildert Uschi Obermaier in authentischem Erzählton Episoden aus ihrem wilden Leben. Grundlage sind 50 Stunden Interview mit dem Journalisten und Drehbuchautor Olaf Kraemer aus dem Jahr 1992. Das Material lag dann fast 15 Jahre auf Eis, weil es sowohl ihr selbst als auch zahlreichen deutschen Verlagen zu drastisch erschien. Nun hat sie es doch publiziert, in ihrem ganz eigenen Sound, der perfekt zu dem rasanten Leben passt, das jahrzehntelang wie ein Roadmovie im Zeitraffer ablief. Zu Anfang sehen wir die kleine Uschi in Sendling, schon damals war sie von den ""wilden Jungs"" im Ort fasziniert. Da gab's die ersten Kellerpartys, geraucht wurde ""Judenstrick"" und nebenbei ""so'n bisschen an den Titties angefasst"". Dann kam der erste Sex, Sex in der Kirche, im Freien, in der Isetta, überall wurde ""rumgemacht"", die Entdeckung der Lust hatte etwas Religiöses. Es folgte der Sprung nach München, sie ""eroberte die Welt an der Seite eines Mannes"", im Big Apple wurde bis morgens gesoffen, gekifft, gesnift und geliebt. Immer schon wollte Uschi Obermaier Verbotenes ausprobieren. Sie ging mit den durchreisenden Musikern aufs Hotelzimmer, schmiss LSD-Trips und machte die ersten Foto-Shootings. 1968 begegnete ihr mit Rainer Langhans die erste große Liebe, Stichwort: Kommune 1 in Berlin. Für die Medien waren sie ""das schönste Paar der APO"" (Stern). Dabei war Uschi Obermaier hoffnungslos unpolitisch und blieb für die übrigen Kommunarden immer das dumme Fotomodell, das bei den endlosen Gruppensessions regelmäßig einschlief. Schließlich ging es zurück nach München, Mick Jagger und Keith Richards klingelten in derselben Nacht an ihrer Tür -- Ersterer machte damals das Rennen, zu dem geplanten Dreier mit David Bowie ist es niemals gekommen. Es folgten die zehn intensiven und selbstzerstörerischen Jahre mit Dieter Bockhorn, dem wilden Prinzen aus Hamburg, mit dem sie nach Indien reiste und im Wohnmobil durch die USA tourte, der aber immer mehr in seiner Drogensucht versank. High Times steht für Sex, Drugs, Rock'n Roll -- dennoch werden Voyeure in dem Buch weniger auf ihre Kosten kommen, dafür aber all diejenigen, die sich ein authentisches Bild einer ganz ungewöhnlichen Stil-Ikone machen wollen.-- Henrik Flor, Literaturtest",,,01/01/94,,[],,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'German Literature']",,9783000261381,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357919449l/6467235.jpg,3.7,[],95.0,1.0,,6467235-high-times,,,,,86.0,97.0,,,,"['27', '30', '26', '12', '2']",,,[],,

Auf Spurensuche in der Wohnung des Verstorbenen stieß Linde nämlich auf detaillierte Pläne des Ex-Kommilitonen zu einem politischen Fanal, der Sprengung der Berliner Siegessäule! Linde findet das Paket mit dem Sprengstoff! In etwas konstruierter Figurenkonstellation stellt Uwe Timm dem Grabredner als hedonistisches Gegenmodell die abgehobene Lichtdesignerin Iris (""ich verkaufe Licht!"" -- spätestens nach einem solchen Satz flieht jeder halbwegs vernünftige Mann), als junge Geliebte zur Seite. Generationen übergreifend ergehen sich beide nun in Reflexionen über Tod, Prosecco und Klassenkampf, über äußere wie innere Verfallsprozesse und die traurigen Reste einer Gesellschaftsutopie, die heute entweder im Alkoholismus aufgeweicht ist, oder gut betucht in raunenden Esoterikzirkeln ihre neue Innerlichkeit feiert. Eines beherrscht Uwe Timm wie auch sein Protagonist perfekt: das Referieren. Mit großem, weltmüdem Gestus wird der Weg vom Agit-Prop zum satten Bildungsbürgertum durchmessen, Handlungsstränge, kaum aufgenommen, gehen wieder verloren -- und so, liebe Trauergemeinde (wie der Leser oft angesprochen wird), werden wir allmählich von grenzenloser Trauer erfüllt über etwas, was, stringenter erzählt, ein Generationen-Thriller mit brisanter hochexplosiver Altlast hätte werden können. Stattdessen werden wir in ein philosophierendes Agit-Quasselseminar gesetzt, der weinerlichen Nabelschau eines luxuriös lebensüberdrüssigen Mittfünfzigers mit Vaterproblemen, der in larmoyanter Süffisanz über seltene Rotweine schwadroniert, die Farbe Rot esoterisch ausleuchtet und Montaigne-Zitate zum Besten gibt, bis er am Ende sein Sprengstoffpaket doch noch loswird. --Ravi Unger",,,11/06/01,October 31st 2003,[],Paperback,"['German Literature', 'Novels', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Germany', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary']",,9783423131254,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181247999l/1132180.jpg,3.75,[],94.0,1.0,,1132180.Rot,,,,,89.0,277.0,432,,Dtv,"['72', '102', '73', '22', '8']",,,['Berlin (Germany)'],,
Uwem Akpan,Say You're One of Them,,English,,"Uwem Akpan's stunning stories humanize the perils of poverty and violence so piercingly that few readers will feel they've ever encountered Africa so immediately. The eight-year-old narrator of ""An Ex-Mas Feast"" needs only enough money to buy books and pay fees in order to attend school. Even when his twelve-year-old sister takes to the streets to raise these meager funds, his dream can't be granted. Food comes first. His family lives in a street shanty in Nairobi, Kenya, but their way of both loving and taking advantage of each other strikes a universal chord. In the second of his stories published in a New Yorker special fiction issue, Akpan takes us far beyond what we thought we knew about the tribal conflict in Rwanda. The story is told by a young girl, who, with her little brother, witnesses the worst possible scenario between parents. They are asked to do the previously unimaginable in order to protect their children. This singular collection will also take the reader inside Nigeria, Benin, and Ethiopia, revealing in beautiful prose the harsh consequences for children of life in Africa. Akpan's voice is a literary miracle, rendering lives of almost unimaginable deprivation and terror into stories that are nothing short of transcendent.",,,06/05/08,September 18th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Africa', 'Historical Fiction', 'Nigeria', 'War', 'African Literature', 'Rwanda', 'Contemporary', 'Kenya']",,9780316113786,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266709325l/2296567.jpg,3.53,"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee for Longlist (2008)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Fiction (2009)', 'PEN Open Book Award (2009)', 'Paris Book Festival for Compilation/Anthology (2010)', 'Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Fiction (2009)', ""Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book in Africa (2009)""]",457.0,7.0,,2296567.Say_You_re_One_of_Them,,,,,84.0,14429.0,358,,"Little, Brown and Company","['2917', '4826', '4327', '1674', '685']",,,"['Benin', 'Kenya', 'Ethiopia', 'Rwanda', 'Nigeria', 'Africa']",,
Uzodinma Iweala,Beasts of No Nation,,English,,"The harrowing, utterly original debut novel by Uzodinma Iweala about the life of a child soldier in a war-torn African country—now a critically-acclaimed Netflix original film directed by Cary Fukunaga (True Detective) and starring Idris Elba (Mandela, The Wire).As civil war rages in an unnamed West-African nation, Agu, the school-aged protagonist of this stunning debut novel, is recruited into a unit of guerilla fighters. Haunted by his father’s own death at the hands of militants, which he fled just before witnessing, Agu is vulnerable to the dangerous yet paternal nature of his new commander.While the war rages on, Agu becomes increasingly divorced from the life he had known before the conflict started—a life of school friends, church services, and time with his family, still intact. As he vividly recalls these sunnier times, his daily reality continues to spin further downward into inexplicable brutality, primal fear, and loss of selfhood. In a powerful, strikingly original voice, Uzodinma Iweala leads the reader through the random travels, betrayals, and violence that mark Agu’s new community.
