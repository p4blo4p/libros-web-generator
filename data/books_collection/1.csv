Damaged by the parents that should have taught him unconditional love; they imprisoned him with violence and disregard. Even now, Shame struggles to find both the independence and love he deserves. Knowing the blood that runs through him is stained merely by reputation, Hem seeks acceptance while he searches for ways to redeem himself in the eyes of those that have judged him his entire life. Together the two have committed themselves to one purpose; protecting those they love the most. Mace Cash is Hem’s younger sister.

When Hem and Shame meet Doc, the President of Lights of Peril Motorcycle Club, their lives take a dramatic turn. Finally escaping from a past that has controlled them, they find themselves living free. But neither of them have known peace for long... This is their story of love, loyalty, and heartbreak.

He sometimes thinks back to his boyhood pirating days, but he doesn't miss Teague's scrutiny or the constant threat of the noose. Besides, he doesn't have much choice-he broke the Code when he freed a friend who had been accused of rogue piracy, and he can no longer show his face in Shipwreck Cove. When Jack's ship is attacked by pirates and his captain dies in the altercation, he suddenly finds himself in command. The wily sailor's skillful negotiations with the pirate captain-who turns out to be a woman from his past-result in a favorable outcome that puts Jack in line for an official promotion.  After making port in Africa, Jack is summoned by Cutler Beckett, who makes him captain of a ship called the Wicked Wench. Beckett gives Jack an assignment. He has heard a legend about a magical island named Zerzura whose labyrinthine bowels are said to contain a glorious treasure. Beckett suspects that one of his house slaves, a girl named Ayisha, is from Zerzura. He asks Jack to take her along on his voyage and seduce her into divulging the island's whereabouts. In payment for his services, Beckett promises Jack a share of the treasure.  But this task isn't as easy as Jack initially believes. Before she agrees to reveal the location of her home, Ayisha insists that Jack take her to the New World to rescue her brother, who has been sold into slavery in the Bahamas. Their voyage is long and arduous, and as they weather a vicious storm and a surprise attack from an old pirate foe, Jack grows to respect and admire Ayisha's bravery. He knows that Beckett intends to enslave her people after robbing them of their treasure, and Jack's moral compass revolts at the idea. It might be possible to deliver Ayisha safely to Zerzura, obtain some of the treasure, and convince Beckett that he never found it . . . but the greedy E. I. T.

A.J. Jacobs,The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible,,English,,"From the bestselling author of ""The Know-It-All"" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, ""The Year of Living Biblically"" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable.

The thirty-six protect us. Without them, humanity would perish. But the thirty-six do not know they are the chosen ones. In Beijing, a monk collapses in his chamber, dead.

Similar deaths are reported around the world—the victims all humanitarians, all with the same death mark. In Venice, an enterprising Italian policeman links the deaths, tracing the evidence. Who is killing good people around the world? In Copenhagen, police are preparing for a world climate summit when they receive the Interpol alert. The task falls to veteran detective Niels Bentzon: Find the “good people” of Denmark and warn them. But Bentzon is a man who is trained to see the worst in humanity, not the good. One by one, people are crossed off his list. He senses their secrets and wrongdoings. Just as Bentzon is ready to give up, he meets Hannah Lund, a brilliant astrophysicist mourning the death of her son and the implosion of her marriage. With Hannah’s help, Bentzon begins to piece together the puzzle of these far-flung deaths. A pattern emerges. It is, they realize, a perfectly executed plan of murder. There have been thirty-four deaths—two more to come if the legend is true. According to the pattern, Bentzon and Hannah can predict the time and place of the final two murders.

A.M. Homes,This Book Will Save Your Life,,English,,"From the author of Music for Torching-an uplifting and apocalyptic tale set in Los Angeles about one man's efforts to bring himself back to life  Since her debut in 1989, A. M. Homes has been among the boldest and most original voices of her generation, acclaimed for the psychological accuracy and unnerving emotional intensity of her storytelling. Her keen ability to explore how extraordinary the ordinary can be is at the heart of her touching and funny new novel, her first in six years.  Richard Novak is a modern-day Everyman, a middle-aged divorcé trading stocks out of his home. He has done such a good job getting his life under control that he needs no one- except his trainer, nutritionist, and housekeeper. He is functionally dead and doesn't even notice until two incidents-an attack of intense pain that lands him in the emergency room, and the discovery of an expanding sinkhole outside his house-conspire to hurl him back into the world. On his way home from the hospital, Richard forms the first of many new relationships: He meets Anhil, the doughnut shop owner, an immigrant who dreams big. He finds a weeping housewife in the produce section of the supermarket, helps save a horse that has fallen into the sinkhole, daringly rescues a woman from the trunk of her kidnapper's car, and, after the sinkhole claims his house and he has to relocate to a Malibu rental, he befriends a reluctant counterculture icon. In the end, Richard is also brought back in closer touch with his family-his aging parents, his brilliant brother, the beloved ex-wife whom he still desires, and finally, before the story's breathtaking finale, with his estranged son Ben.

They have been uneasy rivals since childhood. Then one day George's loses control so extravagantly that he precipitates Harry into an entirely new life. In May We Be Forgiven, Homes gives us a darkly comic look at 21st-century domestic life — at individual lives spiraling out of control, bound together by family and history. The cast of characters experience adultery, accidents, divorce, and death. But it is also a savage and dizzyingly inventive satire on contemporary America, whose dark heart Homes penetrates like no other writer — the strange jargons of its language, its passive aggressive institutions, its inhabitants' desperate craving for intimacy and their pushing it away with litigation, technology, paranoia. At the novel's heart are the spaces in between, where the modern family comes together to re-form itself.

Byatt,The Children's Book,,English,,"Shortlisted for the Man Booker PrizeA spellbinding novel, at once sweeping and intimate, from the Booker Prize–winning author of Possession, that spans the Victorian era through the World War I years, and centers around a famous children’s book author and the passions, betrayals, and secrets that tear apart the people she loves.When Olive Wellwood’s oldest son discovers a runaway named Philip sketching in the basement of the new Victoria and Albert Museum—a talented working-class boy who could be a character out of one of Olive’s magical tales—she takes him into the storybook world of her family and friends.But the joyful bacchanals Olive hosts at her rambling country house—and the separate, private books she writes for each of her seven children—conceal more treachery and darkness than Philip has ever imagined. As these lives—of adults and children alike—unfold, lies are revealed, hearts are broken, and the damaging truth about the Wellwoods slowly emerges. But their personal struggles, their hidden desires, will soon be eclipsed by far greater forces, as the tides turn across Europe and a golden era comes to an end.Taking us from the cliff-lined shores of England to Paris, Munich, and the trenches of the Somme, The Children’s Book is a deeply affecting story of a singular family, played out against the great, rippling tides of the day. It is a masterly literary achievement by one of our most essential writers.",,,04/21/09,October 6th 2009,"['Olive Wellwood', 'Tom Wellwood', 'Dorothy Wellwood', 'Julian Cain', 'Humphrey Wellwood', 'Philip Warren', 'Elsie Warren', 'Prosper Cain', 'Benedict Fludd', 'Florence Cain', 'Pomona Fludd', 'Imogen Fludd', 'Griselda Wellwood', 'Charles Wellwood', 'Hedda Wellwood', 'Phyllis Wellwood', 'Violet Grimwith', 'Florian Wellwood', 'Robin Wellwood', 'Henry Wellwood', 'Basil Wellwood', 'Katharina Wellwood', 'Seraphita Fludd', 'Marian Oakeshott', 'Robin Oakeshott', 'Anselm Stern', 'Toby Youlgreave', 'Herbert Methley', 'Augustus Steyning']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', 'Books About Books', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Unfinished', 'Contemporary']",,9780307272096,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320548114l/6280379.jpg,3.67,"['Booker Prize Nominee (2009)', 'James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction (2009)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2009)']",212.0,3.0,,6280379-the-children-s-book,,,,,85.0,14753.0,675,,Knopf,"['3938', '5020', '3587', '1452', '756']",,,['England'],,

But after a god’s corruption empowered their demon goddess, Sokka, her manipulations have brought the Kurintor to the brink of extinction.  Can the Keepers of Nine awaken the Kurintor descendants in time to defend the Fifth Kingdom, or will the eidolons Sokka has sent forth destroy them?  It isn’t prophecy, destiny, or a birthright, that will decide the fate of the mortal world.  It is choice.  “An attention to atmosphere and psychological insights is just one of the strengths that lend a touch of the fantastic to even ordinary scenes and descriptions.” D. Donovan – Midwest Book Review  “I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan. Some days I believe I’ve simply read too much in these genres, so it’s just too difficult to find a new writer, book, or series that can really excite or surprise me. Then, on other days, I read a book like Kurintor Nyusi by Aaron-Michael Hall. Suddenly, I’m excited by a new writer and I’m seeing new things in one of my favorite genres.” R.

Aaron-Michael Hall (Goodreads Author),The Rise of Nazil: Complete Epic Fantasy Trilogy: Gritty Epic Fantasy,,,," 
  INTERNATIONAL EPIC FANTASY AWARD-WINNER
 
  
Before Nazil’s rise...came its destruction.The liberation of a world ignited the Zon’tul demon’s hunger to consume it.The battles fought in The Rise of Nazil were the presage of an impending war. A war not for land, wealth, or power, but for the fate of the mortal world which hung tethered to a brittle filament, separating the Nether from the mortal. As the gods continued to weaken, the demons began their rise.What began with Mah’saahc’s awakening in Seed of Scorn, crept across Faélondul, devouring and possessing the souls of men, incessantly seeking the Blood of Oisin needed to breach the threshold between realms.The sacrifices and bonds that once held the Benoists’ together could be the catalyst which tears them apart. The darkness is coming, and once the sides are chosen, neither can win...without dying.If you love the intrigue and treachery of George R.R. Martin, the epic battles and characterization of R.A. Salvatore, and the exceptional world-building, politics, and magical systems of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, The Rise of Nazil trilogy will captivate you from start to finish.Step away from the ordinary and immerse yourself in a unique and enthralling diverse epic fantasy. 
  Faélondul Awaits
 “The Rise of Nazil is an epic fantasy that should be shelved next to the works of R.A. Salvatore and J. R. R. Tolkien. This book was the best read of 2015.” -Mudville Dames“The Rise of Nazil is a complex work, with the violence, intricate treacheries, and modern sensibilities of The Game of Thrones.” -Amazon“This is the best epic fantasy trilogy I’ve read in over a decade. The plot twists, deep characters, amazing prose, superb dialogue, and worldbuilding are mere elements in the vast tapestry Hall creates. This trilogy defies categorization.”  -Amazon“This is a complex plot at its best. The character development is perfect.” -Readers’ Favorite

  Innocence was never meant for the addictive…
Addiction was something Krit Corbin accepted as part of his nature a long time ago. He decided to embrace it and flip his finger at the rules. Women had always been the number one thing on his list of addictions. He couldn’t get enough. Being the lead singer in a rock band had only made access to his favorite addiction that much easier. Being alone was the only thing Blythe Denton understood. The small town minister’s family that raised her hadn’t accepted her as their own. The minister’s wife had always made sure Blythe understood just how unworthy she was of love. When Blythe is sent away to college and given a chance to finally be free of living as an unwanted burden, she looks forward to having peace in her life. Being alone isn’t something that bothers her. She escapes reality in the stories she writes.However, the ridiculously sexy tattooed guy who keeps throwing parties in the apartment above hers is driving her crazy. For starters, he doesn’t treat her like she would expect a guy with a different woman always hanging on his arm to treat someone as uninteresting as her. She looks nothing like the gorgeous women she sees parading in and out of his apartment, but for some strange reason he keeps showing up at her door.During a party at his apartment, Krit’s new neighbor comes to the door with her long brown hair pulled up in a messy knot and a pair of glasses perched on her cute little nose. She wants him to turn down the music, but he convinces her to stay.
  Krit Corbin may have just found his biggest addiction yet. And Blythe Denton realizes too late that she’s finally been claimed.

Abdul Haleem Sharar,Firdaus e Bareen / فردوس بریں,,Urdu,,"The book was first published in 1899. The story of Husain and Zammarrud fallen in the grip of the Assassins take us back to the last days of Hasan Bin Sabah's merciless followers, at the end of which the sect's stronghold, the famous fort of Alamoot, was destroyed by the even more merciless Mongol hordes. Sharar writes famously in the style of a Walter Scott novel, the novel itself being a new literary form in his day. But there are shades of an earlier indigenous genre - the Dastaan - in his work. Yet although he tells a gripping tale, part Scott and part Dastaan, he is not unaware of character. Husain may be credulous, and smitten silly by his love for Zammarrud, but he can still ask Shaikh Vujoodi intelligent questions which the Shaikh can only parry by the display of great wrath and superhuman knowledge. Husain's credulity in accepting his answers immediately has a lot to do with his fear that he would not be allowed to visit his beloved in 'Paradise.' There is a definite modern streak in Sharar's work. His treatment of Zamarrud is different from the usual portrayal of female characters in his day. Zamarrud has a mind of her own. She is observant and intelligent and capable of rebuffing her lover when he sounds credulous and foolish. No old fashioned perceptions of female 'duty' or the superior status of men holds her back from realizing that she is more clear-headed than Husain. She is moreover not mild of manner or adulatory of her man, as the prototypes of female perfection tend to be in Urdu literature of the day. Yet non of this detracts from her femininity, as she runs around 'like a delicate, fleet-footed doe' but fully determined to have her way. Much has been written about the Assassins in English and other languages. Sharar's novel has its own charm, and given a chance it should become a very popular book. Translated into Tajik, Sharar's works have quite a lot of readers in Tajikistan, where they are also the subject of a Ph.D. dissertation by Vladimir Lanikin.",,,10/30/99,2014,[],Hardcover,"['Classics', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351148739l/15726423.jpg,4.01,[],97.0,1.0,,15726423-firdaus-e-bareen,,,,,90.0,173.0,165,,Sang e Meel Publications,"['75', '51', '29', '10', '8']",,,[],,

"Abdul Malik Mujahid, Darussalam",200 Golden Hadith,,English,,"Get this book from iBook store by following URL http://goo.gl/eNxGwdEvery Muslim is aware of the importance of the Prophet’s hadiths. Islam is based on two major sources: the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and the latter is available to us in the form of hadiths. The Prophet said, “Whoever comes to know one hadith of mine should spread it.” However, the Prophet also told us to be careful when spreading his hadiths so as not to alter any component of it, otherwise, “he can take his seat in the hellfire.”Within this book I have incorporated 200 small hadiths of the Prophet. The reason for choosing the smaller hadiths of the Prophets is so that the youth can easily become accustomed to the words of the Prophet. All the hadiths concern the important matters of the religion, which every person should have knowledge of. I have come to the realization that many youth from among the Muslims have not memorized even one hadith of the Prophet. For this reason I have chosen smaller hadiths so that they can be easily memorized by them and they can spread them to others. This way our relatives and our friends can memorize some words of the Prophet which will bring them benefit in the hereafter.This book has purposely not been organized into any specific categories. Experience through the years has taught me that this style of non-categorization is easier for the general masses who are not scholars or students of knowledge. I am also aware that many languages exists out there in which the hadiths of the Prophet have not yet been translated.

"Abdul-Jabbar Khan, Danyal Nicholson (Editor)",What is Numerology?,,English,,"It should be known that human beings by nature have a concern and a strong desire to control the future as well as to seek to prevent loss of control. Mankind by nature, seeks order in a world or in an environment where that order may be threatened. Humans look for meaning in things. They look for a well-ordered system as well as patterns. Everything has divine coding that can slowly be unravelled through Numerology. Though it is permissible in Islam, crossing the limits is unacceptable. What is meant here by transgressing pass the boundaries is when numerologists delve into impermissible acts such as Astrology, Tarot reading, psychic reading, magic, and all those sciences and occultic acts that are completely impermissible in the revealed law. Just because the human hands have divine coding in them, it does not make palm reading permissible. Just because we all have star signs, it does not render horoscopic readings permissible. There is divine wisdom in the acts that are forbidden and even the acts that are permissible within the revealed law of Islam that step beyond the comprehension of the human intellect. If we follow this religious law, we will be safe and will not be imprisoned by the ego and desires, Satan and the world. We must be free from all this. This book reveals how non-Muslims use Numerology and what Islam says about it. This book is a great starter for anyone studying comparative religion or anyone interested in seeking further knowledge in the field of numerology, which essentially spun off from mathematics.",,,02/17/15,August 8th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B013NTSSSA,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440074172l/26134245._SY475_.jpg,3.33,[],93.0,1.0,,26134245-what-is-numerology,,,,,,3.0,39,,Purity Publications,[],,,[],,

Abdullah Hussein,Nadaar Log / نادار لوگ,,Urdu,,"Published first in 1996 this novel by Abdullah Hussain is considered as a sequel to his famous Udaas Naslain. The story of this novel takes place during 1897 to 1974. This is the story of a generation that has no urge to protect and fight for its rights, people who have accepted everything as fate and have left themselves to the flow of time. The story really gets a takeoff after 1947 when Pakistan gets independence and the people who fought for certain ideals are pushed to wall by those who happen to be in corridors of power. The novel describes those years of indifference, difficulties and turbulence which first germinate the seeds of undemocratic governments and then it leads to secession of the country in 1971. The novel suggests that this was the period where if truth was upheld the history and the geography of Pakistan would have been different but since people kept silence which tantamount to a sin, so they have to reap the wages of this in shape of disintegrating the federation and losing their brothers. Nadar Loog is the story of a people who had great ideals but were found wanting in action when it mattered to stand and assert.

The novel also contains a focus on the culture, lifestyle and the wide social divide that exists among the people of Kanpur.Synopsis:An egocentric and personable man with an unforgettable history that could emotionally haunt any ordinary human, Monty, still in his early thirties, was officially single despite a reputation of having plentiful amorous adventures. He was internally annoyed with the constant cynical jibes about his obscure profession; an independent investigator during the day of petty crimes like frivolous thefts, but an impeccable lady’s man by night.When destiny presented a sudden unanticipated chance, with the sole intention to shut the blabbering jokers up, he decided to investigate the mysterious murder of a lonely glamorous girl, with minimal aid from his apprentice and without any access to forensic science.What followed the crime scene investigation was a series of confrontation with perhaps the cleverest and astute accused people, strange events and confusing outcomes.

Adunni is a fourteen-year-old Nigerian girl who knows what she wants: an education. This, her mother has told her, is the only way to get a “louding voice”—the ability to speak for herself and decide her own future. But instead, Adunni's father sells her to be the third wife of a local man who is eager for her to bear him a son and heir.When Adunni runs away to the city, hoping to make a better life, she finds that the only other option before her is servitude to a wealthy family. As a yielding daughter, a subservient wife, and a powerless slave, Adunni is told, by words and deeds, that she is nothing.But while misfortunes might muffle her voice for a time, they cannot mute it. And when she realizes that she must stand up not only for herself, but for other girls, for the ones who came before her and were lost, and for the next girls, who will inevitably follow; she finds the resolve to speak, however she can—in a whisper, in song, in broken English—until she is heard.",,,,February 4th 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Africa', 'Feminism', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Nigeria', 'Coming Of Age']",,9781524746025,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581128232l/50214741.jpg,4.49,[],99.0,1.0,,50214741-the-girl-with-the-louding-voice,,,,,99.0,29527.0,384,,Dutton Books,"['17186', '9980', '2003', '274', '84']",,,[],,

"Abigail Adams, John Adams",My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams,,English,,"In 1762, John Adams penned a flirtatious note to ""Miss Adorable,"" the 17-year-old Abigail Smith. In 1801, Abigail wrote to wish her husband John a safe journey as he headed home to Quincy after serving as president of the nation he helped create. The letters that span these nearly forty years form the most significant correspondence--and reveal one of the most intriguing and inspiring partnerships--in American history.As a pivotal player in the American Revolution and the early republic, John had a front-row seat at critical moments in the creation of the United States, from the drafting of the Declaration of Independence to negotiating peace with Great Britain to serving as the first vice president and second president under the U.S. Constitution. Separated more often than they were together during this founding era, John and Abigail shared their lives through letters that each addressed to ""My Dearest Friend,"" debating ideas and commenting on current events while attending to the concerns of raising their children (including a future president).Full of keen observations and articulate commentary on world events, these letters are also remarkably intimate. This new collection--including some letters never before published--invites readers to experience the founding of a nation and the partnership of two strong individuals, in their own words.

Abo Polak,"The Kabbalah of Jesus Christ, Part 1 The True Good Tidings",,English,,"The revolutionary view of the esoteric teachings of Jesus, which helps discover the secret spiritual knowledge hidden in the Bible. The book explains the symbolism of the basic stories in the Bible and the reasons why they were hidden deep behind symbols and metaphors. Those interpretations are unique and new, unlike the literal taking on this subject prevalent in the published works so far. The reader can easily rediscover the essence of the message left by Jesus.This approach allows disclosure of the secret message of the Bible and explains extraordinary knowledge of the ancient sages, mostly of Jewish origin, who have been pathfinders for the Christian thought.The book fits into the popular current of searching for hidden meanings in the Bible. It also makes references to the Jewish Kabbalah philosophy, coherently and logically connecting the New Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ to it.It relates the Biblical message to the latest modern scientific discoveries, with references to quantum physics, astronomy and psychology.Many readers and literary critics who have read the book emphasise that this is the first effort which successfully presents the teachings of Jesus in such an interesting way. The Kabbalah oj Jesus Christ, Part 1, The True Good Tidings is perfect for:Seekers of inner truths of life interested in gnosis, mysticism and spiritual paths.

"Abolqasem Ferdowsi, Dick Davis (Translator), جلال خالقی مطلق (Editor), Azar Nafisi (Goodreads Author) (Foreword)",Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings,,English,,"Among the great works of world literature, perhaps one of the least familiar to English readers is the ""Shahnameh: ThePersian Book of Kings,"" the national epic of Persia. This prodigious narrative, composed by the poet Ferdowsi between the years 980 and 1010, tells the story of pre- Islamic Iran, beginning in the mythic time of Creation and continuing forward to the Arab invasion in the seventh century. As a window on the world, ""Shahnameh"" belongs in the company of such literary masterpieces as Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" the plays of Shakespeare, the epics of Homer- classics whose reach and range bring whole cultures into view. In its pages are unforgettable moments of national triumph and failure, human courage and cruelty, blissful love and bitter grief.In tracing the roots of Iran, ""Shahnameh"" initially draws on the depths of legend and then carries its story into historical times, when ancient Persia was swept into an expanding Islamic empire. Now Dick Davis, the greatest modern translator of Persian poetry, has revisited that poem, turning the finest stories of Ferdowsi's original into an elegant combination of prose and verse. For the first time in English, in the most complete form possible, readers can experience ""Shahnameh"" in the same way that Iranian storytellers have lovingly conveyed it in Persian for the past thousand years.",دوره چهار جلدی شاهنامه استاد خالقی مطلق,,10/28/10,2006,"['Sohrab', 'Rostam', 'Esfandiar', 'Simorgh &...']",Hardcover,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'History', 'Iran', 'Mythology', 'Literature', 'Epic', 'Medieval', 'Historical', 'Nonfiction']",,9780670034857,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386921438l/157985.jpg,4.52,[],567.0,6.0,,157985.Shahnameh,,,,,97.0,4137.0,886,,Viking,"['2839', '803', '352', '90', '53']",,,"['Iran, Islamic Republic of', 'Persia']",,

Abraham Verghese (Goodreads Author),Cutting for Stone,,English,,"A sweeping, emotionally riveting first novel - an enthralling family saga of Africa and America, doctors and patients, exile and home.Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother’s death in childbirth and their father’s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics—their passion for the same woman—that will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him—nearly destroying him—Marion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.An unforgettable journey into one man’s remarkable life, and an epic story about the power, intimacy, and curious beauty of the work of healing others.(front flap)",,First Edition,10/28/09,02/03/09,"['Thomas Stone', 'Sister Mary Joseph Praise', 'Marion Stone', 'Shiva Stone']",Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Africa', 'Book Club', 'Medicine', 'Ethiopia', 'Medical', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical']",,9780375414497,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553715166l/3591262._SX318_.jpg,4.29,"['PEN/Hemingway Foundation Award Nominee (2010)', 'Exclusive Books Boeke Prize Nominee (2011)', 'Indies Choice Book Award for Adult Fiction (2010)', 'Dayton Literary Peace Prize Nominee for Fiction (2010)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Shortlist (2009)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fiction (2009)']",15633.0,195.0,,3591262-cutting-for-stone,,,,,95.0,336889.0,541,,Alfred A.

Nestled in the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee, the town of Johnson City had always seemed exempt from the anxieties of modern American life. But when the local hospital treated its first AIDS patient, a crisis that had once seemed an urban problem had arrived in the town to stay. Working in Johnson City was Abraham Verghese, a young Indian doctor specializing in infectious diseases. Dr. Verghese became by necessity the local AIDS expert, soon besieged by a shocking number of male and female patients whose stories came to occupy his mind, and even take over his life. Verghese brought a singular perspective to Johnson City: as a doctor unique in his abilities; as an outsider who could talk to people suspicious of local practitioners; above all, as a writer of grace and compassion who saw that what was happening in this conservative community was both a medical and a spiritual emergency.""",,,11/06/94,April 25th 1995,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Biography', 'Science', 'Health', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'History']",,9780679752929,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1589461443l/161121._SY475_.jpg,4.2,"['Lambda Literary Award for Biography/Autobiography (1995)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (1994)']",80.0,1.0,,161121.My_Own_Country,,,,,96.0,10393.0,432,,Vintage,"['4505', '3969', '1481', '327', '111']",,,[],,

In the first step, On Disciplining the Soul, which cites copious anecdotes from the Islamic scriptures and biographies of the saints, Ghazali explains how to acquire good character traits, and goes on to describe how the sickness of the heart may be cured. In the second part, Breaking the Two Desires, he focusses on the question of gluttony and sexual desire, concluding, in the words of the Prophet, that 'the best of all matters is the middle way'. The translator has added an introduction and notes which explore Ghazali's ability to make use of Greek as well as Islamic ethics.

The book was written in or around 1022 CE in Játiva, south of Valencia, by Abu Muhammad `Ali Ibn Hazm al-Andalusi (Córdoba, 994-1064 CE). It is a youth work by this famous Andalusian poet, philosopher, jurist and scholar of comparative religion.In thirty chapters Ibn Hazm treats thirty moments or personages that are of relevance to love relationships, such as the signs of love, love at first sight, amorous allusions, correpondence between lovers, the messenger between the lovers, being together, fidelity and unfidelity, separation, death. Ibn Hazm alternates from theoritical observations to anecdotes of daily life and he ornates his essays with an abundance of appropriate poetry. The anecdotes are often very peronal and they give the reader a enthralling view on life and love in Islamic Córdoba. All poetry in the Ring of the Dove is Ibn Hazm's own.The Ring of the Dove has been preserved in only one manuscript, which is, since 1665, part of the Oriental collections of Leiden University Library (where it is registered as Or. 927). It was copied in 1338 CE, most probably in Egypt or Syria, from an original that is now lost. The manuscript was first acquired in Istanbul in the middle of the 17th century by the learned and bibliophile Dutch ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Levinus Warner (1619-1665). After his death his entire collection of books and manuscripts came to Leiden.The first edition of the Arabic text was made by the Russian D.K. Pétrof and was published in Leiden in 1914. Before that R.P.A. Dozy (1820-1883) had already published several fragments. All later editions and the numerous translations of the book are directly, or, mostly, indirectly based on the Leiden manuscript. Together they are proof to the fact that Ibn Hazm in his book on love and lovers treats themes that are for all humans in all times.",,,11/06/22,2006,[],Paperback,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'Islam', 'Literature', 'History', 'Religion', 'Romance', 'Unfinished']",,9789953435022,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327852446l/5582346.jpg,3.9,[],72.0,1.0,,5582346,,,,,91.0,5150.0,328,,دار مكتبة الحياة,"['1714', '1785', '1211', '317', '123']",,,[],,

With time ticking away and Born vampires’ lives in jeopardy, it quickly becomes evident that someone—or something—desperately wants Dawn and is willing to shed any amount of blood to get her.Dawn has only one chance to face her demons and overcome all obstacles standing in her way as she embarks on the biggest mission of her life—one that threatens a deadly outcome for all involved.",Angel Creek #2,,,November 27th 2012,[],Paperback,"['Vampires', 'Paranormal', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Werewolves', 'Fiction', 'Amazon']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1341461704l/15731772.jpg,4.34,[],10.0,1.0,,15731772-reawakened,,,,,94.0,251.0,540,,,"['146', '65', '25', '10', '5']",,,[],,

Adam Becker (Goodreads Author),What Is Real?: The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics,,English,,"The untold story of the heretical thinkers who dared to question the nature of our quantum universeEvery physicist agrees quantum mechanics is among humanity's finest scientific achievements. But ask what it means, and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have followed Niels Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation and dismissed questions about the reality underlying quantum physics as meaningless. A mishmash of solipsism and poor reasoning, Copenhagen endured, as Bohr's students vigorously protected his legacy, and the physics community favored practical experiments over philosophical arguments. As a result, questioning the status quo long meant professional ruin. And yet, from the 1920s to today, physicists like John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett persisted in seeking the true meaning of quantum mechanics.

What started off as a couple of months to get away for an adventure turned into a ten-year journey of learning, enlightenment, hard times, and moments that will never leave me, including times of joy, sorrow, love, pain, near-death experiences, and experiences nearly worth dying for. During that time, I travelled to over 60 countries, set foot on every continent, including Antarctica; worked in over half a dozen countries; and saw relics from ancient civilisations and technological marvels of the modern world. I saw the highest peak on earth, the lowest valley, and so much in between. I visited places where they had never seen a white man before and countries ruled by governances ranging from democracies to theocracies to military regimes. I saw the cruelty that humanity can have for each other as well as the love that can bind us all.
