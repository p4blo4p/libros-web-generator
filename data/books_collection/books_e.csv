For this was the place where accidents happened. Perhaps Michael should have heeded the locals’ warnings: ‘There’s no luck for them as meddles with Gipsy’s Acre.’ Michael Rogers is a man who is about to learn the true meaning of the old saying ‘In my end is my beginning.’The title Endless Night was taken from William Blake’s Auguries of Innocence and describes Christie’s favourite theme in the novel: a “twisted” character, who always chooses evil over good.Christie finished Endless Night in six weeks, as opposed to the three-four months that most of her other novels took. Despite being in her seventies while writing it, she told an interviewer that being Michael, the twenty-something narrator, “wasn’t difficult. After all, you hear people like him talking all the time.”The book is dedicated to Christie's relative ""Nora Prichard from whom I first heard the legend of Gipsy's Acre.""

As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, so that people are fated to repeat triumphs and failures over and over. In another, there is a place where time stands still, visited by lovers and parents clinging to their children. In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar.Now translated into thirty languages, Einstein’s Dreams has inspired playwrights, dancers, musicians, and painters all over the world.

Exposure,,"['Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery']","In Exposure, award-winning writer Alan Russell delivers an intricate, ambitious thriller that unfolds at break-neck speed against a glamorous and absorbing background. England's most beloved philanthropist and her football-star lover die in a crash caused by a mystery car. A papparazzo-Graham Wells, the driver of that mystery car-would do anything to keep his terrible secret from getting out. So when a CIA operative blackmails him into engineering the scandalous downfalls of several high-profile celebrities, he has no choice. Nothing he's done is illegal-and his targets are certainly guilty of the acts he's caught on film-but he doesn't understand the purpose of his actions and the whole arrangement leaves a bad taste in his mouth. Then Graham, desperately trapped in the hidden motives of the CIA, stops a superstar actress who thought she was alone from committing suicide. Lanie Byrne, the beloved Miss L, is perhaps Hollywood's biggest celebrity, and although Graham is feeling desperate himself, he has trouble imagining what could possibly cause this beautiful actress to want to die. This charitable act ignites a chain-reaction of political intrigue and personal danger from which there might be no escape.

   bestselling author Alexa Riley's first full-length novel shows just what happens when a strong, possessive man finds the woman of his dreams.
   

  I'll never forget the way she looked, so confident and sure of herself. I watched her from a distance. She wasn't ready for me yet. I didn't approach her and I didn't disturb her, but I never once took my eyes off her. 
   
Mallory Sullivan is ready to start her new life. After graduating at the top of her class, she's landed one of the most coveted internships in the United States. Hard work and determination have gotten her to this moment of living the life she only dreamed of while growing up in foster care. 
  From the start, I knew that she would be my greatest achievement, so the day I let her go, I set down a path for her. A path to me. 
   
She never expected Oz to be the greatest culmination of those dreams. But sometimes fate determines who you fall in love with. Who makes you lose control. Who owns your soul. And then you realize it wasn't fate at all… 
  I've wanted to care for and protect her since the first moment I saw her. I've constructed everything in our lives so that at the perfect moment, I could have her, could give her the life she deserves.
   

  The time has come.

Entre tanto hombre sin amor, apenas queda sitio para un hombre honrado Otoño de 1615. Un doble enlace por poderes está a punto de unir las coronas de Francia y España en una alianza que pretende ser el germen de la paz en Europa: el de la española Ana de Austria con Luis XIII, rey de Francia, y el de la francesa Isabel de Borbón con el príncipe Felipe. Tras los festejos, ambas damas, seguidas por sus respectivas cortes, emprenderán su camino hasta el paso de Behovia, en la frontera sobre el río Bidasoa, donde se producirá lo que ya se conoce popularmente como «El intercambio de las princesas». Pero Isidoro Montemayor, secretario y amante de la condesa de Cameros, no participa del júbilo general. Un asunto de contrabando de plata pone en peligro a su adorada Micaela y, en consecuencia, también a él. Isidoro, héroe a su pesar, amante contrariado y tenaz investigador, se ve de repente obligado a cambiar la pluma por la espada e intentar conservar la vida en una España donde abundan las puñaladas a traición, tanto en los callejones lóbregos como en las resplandecientes alcobas reales. Con maestría, rigor y una velada ironía, Alfonso Mateo-Sagasta recrea ante nuestros ojos una España marcada por la corrupción y nos brinda esta apasionante aventura de caballeros despechados, damas enamoradas, aunque no bobas, y metales preciosos que unos y otros desean sobre todas las cosas.

Read a good review. Cover caught my eye. I can appreciate a cool cover. But it’s like the extra credit part of a test—it only enhances an already solid grade.

I look at them in a more voyeuristic way, like a literary gaper’s delay: Wow, the author knows So and So. Bet they send each other clever text messages. Really the only thing I can gauge from the blurbs is my own pathetic jealousy level.To get a true sense of the book, I have to spend a minute inside. I’ll glance at the first couple pages, then flip to the middle, see if the language matches me somehow. It’s like dating, only with sentences. Some sentences, no matter how well-dressed or nice, just don’t do it for me. Others I click with instantly. It could be something as simple yet weirdly potent as a single word choice (tangerine).

EntreMundos/AmongWorlds,New Perspectives on Gloria Anzaldua,Literary Collections,"EntreMundos offers a multidisciplinary investigation of the concepts, impact, and writings of contemporary cultural theorist and creative writer, Gloria Anzaldua. Her work, which is frequently anthologized and often cited, as well as widely taught at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate level, has challenged and expanded previous views in American Studies, Chicano/a Studies, composition studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, feminism, literary studies, critical pedagogy, and queer theory.

Enlivenment: Toward a Poetics for the Anthropocene,,['Philosophy'],"A new understanding of the Anthropocene that is based on mutual transformation with nature rather than control over nature.We have been told that we are living in the Anthropocene, a geological era shaped by humans rather than by nature. In Enlivenment, German philosopher Andreas Weber presents an alternative understanding of our relationship with nature, arguing not that humans control nature but that humans and nature exist in a commons of mutual transformation. There is no nature-human dualism, he contends, because the fundamental dimension of existence is shared in what he calls aliveness. All subjectivity is intersubjectivity. Self is self-through-other. Seeing all beings in a common household of matter, desire, and imagination, an economy of metabolic and economic transformation, is ""enlivenment."" This perspective allows us to move beyond Enlightenment-style thinking that strips material reality of any subjectivity.To take this step, Weber argues, we need to supplant the concept of techn� with the concept of poiesis as the element that brings forth reality. In a world not divided into things and ideas, culture and nature, reality arises from the creation of relationships and continuous fertile transformations; any thinking in terms of relationships comes about as a poetics. The self is always a function of the whole; the whole is equally a function of the individual. Only this integrated freedom allows humanity to reconcile with the natural world.This first English edition of Enlivenment has been expanded and updated from the German edition.",,,11/06/16,March 5th 2019,[],Paperback,,9780262536660,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550053887l/42068914.jpg,4.18,[],50.0,1.0,,,,91.0,22.0,208,MIT Press,"['12', '4', '4', '2', '0']",,[],,['Andreas Weber']
Enigma Variations,,"['Fiction', 'LGBT', 'Short Stories', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Gay', 'Queer', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'American']","A passionate portrait of love’s contradictory power, in five illuminating stories.Andre Aciman, who has been called “the most exciting new fiction writer of the twenty-first century” (New York Magazine), has written a novel in Enigma Variations that charts the life of Paul whose loves remain as consuming and covetous throughout adulthood as they were in adolescence. Whether in southern Italy, where as a boy he has a crush on his parents’ cabinet maker, or on a snowbound campus in New England, where his enduring passion for a girl he’ll meet again and again over the years is punctuated by anonymous encounters with men; on a tennis court in Central Park, or a sidewalk in early spring New York, his attachments are ungraspable, transient and forever underwritten by raw desire—not for just one person’s body but, inevitably, for someone else’s as well. In mapping the most inscrutable corners of desire, Aciman proves to be an unsparing reader of the human psyche and a master stylist of contemporary literature. With language at once lyrical, bare-knuckled, and unabashedly candid, he casts a sensuous, shimmering light over each facet of desire to probe how we ache, want, and waver, and ultimately how we sometimes falter and let go of those who may want only to offer what we crave from them. Behind every step the hero takes, his hopes, denials, fears, and regrets are always ready to lay their traps. Yet the dream of love always casts its luminous halo. We may not always know what we want. We may remain enigmas to ourselves and others. But sooner or later we discover who we’ve always known we were.",,,,January 3rd 2017,[],Hardcover,,9780374148430,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465643290l/29875935.jpg,3.72,[],99.0,1.0,,,,90.0,6205.0,266,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","['1404', '2365', '1815', '517', '104']",,[],,['André Aciman']

In this unnerving collection drawn from her personal crime files, ""America's best true-crime writer"" (Kirkus Reviews) Ann Rule brilliantly dissects the convoluted love affairs that all too often end in violence.Expertly analyzing a shocking, headline-making case, Rule unmasks the deadly motives inside a seemingly idyllic marriage: a beautiful young wife, a rising star in America's top-ranked computer corporation, and a prosperous husband, the scion of a family building business. With an adorable son and a gorgeous home, the couple seemed to have it all. But a furtive evil permeated their days and nights, dragging them into a murky world of drugs, sordid sex, and con operations. In this realm, one of them would prove to be a virtual innocent, the other a manipulator with no conscience. Sudden, violent death brought their charade of a fairy-tale romance to a tragic end -- with a brutal crime that might never have come to light were it not for the stubborn detectives and prosecutors whose fight for justice spanned an entire decade.Empty Promises recounts several other cases where the search for love brought only lies and betrayal -- a cautionary primer, perhaps, for those who trust too much too soon. Powerful because they strike so close to home, the cases in Empty Promises will leave readers shaken by the realities of love gone terribly -- and fatally -- wrong.",Crime Files #7,,,January 1st 2001,[],Paperback,,9780671025335,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489674661l/1170244._SY475_.jpg,3.97,[],100.0,2.0,,,,95.0,2459.0,524,Pocket Books,"['819', '885', '637', '110', '8']",,[],,['Ann Rule']

Both came from fine Southern families, and dreamed of the Tara-like plantation where they would grow roses, raise horses, and move in the genteel circles of Atlanta society. Less than two months later, their dream exploded in terror and murder: their beautiful home mysteriously burned to the ground and Tom was convicted of the brutal slaying of his mother and father.Pat's only brother had died in a puzzling suicide, her grandparents-in-law were poisoned with arsenic, and no one—from her wealthy employers to her own children—was safe when Pat Allanson didn't get her way. It took Georgia lawmen more than two decades to stop her for good—if indeed they have.In this fascinating account, Ann Rule delivers a tour de force: a whirlwind of misguided love, denial, guilt, and passions out of control; a series of brilliantly manipulated crimes; the bizarre and horrifying tale of two families brought to ruin; and, at the center of it all, the heartless, supremely selfish sociopath whose evil hid behind soft words and gentle manners, but who destroyed—without mercy—those who loved her.",,,12/01/92,December 1st 1993,[],Paperback,,9780671690717,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412143011l/225383.jpg,4.01,"['Anthony Award Nominee for Best True Crime (1993)', 'Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (1993)']",350.0,4.0,,,,95.0,6483.0,560,Pocket Books,"['2248', '2390', '1543', '252', '50']",,[],,['Ann Rule']

Earthly Powers,,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Religion', 'British Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Modern Classics', '20th Century']","Anthony Burgess, author of A Clockwork Orange, is regarded as one of the most original and daring writers in the English language. His work is illuminated by a dazzling imagination, by a gift for character and plot, by a talent for surprise. In Earthly Powers Burgess created his masterpiece. At its center are two twentieth-century men who represent different kinds of power—Kenneth Toomey, eminent novelist, a man who has outlived his contemporaries to survive into honored, bitter, luxurious old age as a celebrity of dubious notoriety; and Don Carlo Campanati, a man of God, eventually beloved Pope, who rises through the Vatican as a shrewd manipulator to become the architect of church revolution and a candidate for sainthood. Through the lives of these two modern men Burgess explores the very essence of power. As each pursues his career—one to sainthood, one to wealthy exile—their relationship becomes the heart of a narrative that incorporates almost everyone of fame and distinction in the social, literary, and political life of America and Europe. This astonishing company is joined together by the art of a great novelist into an explosive and entertaining tour de force that will captivate fans of sweeping historic fiction.",,,10/28/80,May 6th 2004,"['Kenneth Toomey', 'Don Carlo Campanati']",Paperback,,9780099468646,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355598044l/8822.jpg,4.15,"['Booker Prize Nominee (1980)', 'Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger for Roman (1981)']",411.0,5.0,,,,93.0,2713.0,649,Vintage Classics,"['1227', '907', '397', '130', '52']",,['Vatican City (Italy)'],,['Anthony Burgess']

Exploring English,,"['Short Stories', 'Fiction']","Difficult as it may be to understand today, the Exploring English anthology of short stories was revolutionary when first published forty four years ago in 1967. For the first time the short story was to be taught as part of the English syllabus for the Intermediate Certificate. For the first time students of English were introduced to the work of Irish writers such as Liam O'Flaherty, Frank O'Connor, Sean Ó Faoláin, Mary Lavin, Brian Friel and Benedict Kiely. Exploring English has resonated with countless thousands of Irish students. For many it provided a gateway to a lifetime of reading and the enjoyment of literature. For even more it was an icon of their school days with its unmistakeable angular cover design.

And he fully expects his best friend Poppy, a deer mouse, to help him celebrate in a grand manner. But Poppy has gone off somewhere with her husband, Rye, and it appears she has forgotten all about it. ""Belching Beavers,"" says Ereth, ""I am not angry!""

In one of the traps, Ereth finds Leaper the Fox—who, with her dying breath, begs the prickly porcupine to take care of her three boisterous young kits, Tumble, Nimble, and Flip.

Empire of the Ants,,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'France', 'Animals', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'French Literature', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Literature']","Here is the stunning international bestseller in the tradition of Watership Down but with a dark, original twist. Unique, daring, and unforgettable, it tells the story of an ordinary family who accidentally threaten the security of a hidden civilization as intelligent as our own--a colony of ants determined to survive at any cost....Jonathan Wells and his young family have come to the Paris flat at 3, rue des Sybarites through the bequest of his eccentric late uncle Edmond. Inheriting the dusty apartment, the Wells family are left with only one warning: Never go down into the cellar.But when the family dog disappears down the basement steps, Jonathan follows--and soon his wife, his son, and various would-be rescuers vanish into its mysterious depths.Meanwhile, in a pine stump in a nearby park, a vast civilization is in turmoil. Here a young female from the russet ant nation of Bel-o-kan learns that a strange new weapon has been killing off her comrades. To find out why, she enlists the help of a warrior ant, and the two set off on separate journeys into a harsh and violent world. It is a world where death takes many forms--savage birds and voracious lizards, warlike dwarf ants and rapacious termites, poisonous beetles and, most bizarre of all, the swift, murderous, giant guardians of the edge of the world: cars.Yet the end of the female's desperate quest will be the eerie secret in the cellar at 3, rue des Sybarites--a mystery she must solve in order to fulfill her special destiny as the new queen of her own great empire. But to do so she must first make unthinkable communion with the most barbaric creatures of all. Empire of the Ants is a brilliant evocation of a hidden civilization as complex as our own and far more ancient. It is a fascinating realm where boats are built of leaves and greenflies are domesticated and milked like cows, where citizens lock antennae in ""absolute communication"" and fight wars with precisely coordinated armies using sprays of glue and acids that can dissolve a snail.

E.M. Forster - A Passage to India,,Language Arts & Disciplines,"A Passage to India (1924), the last of E. M. Forster's novels to be published in his lifetime, became an immediate bestseller and also met with critical acclaim for its moral and political commentary on the crossings between individuals and cultures in the India of the British Empire. Forster's record of the terrible consequences of failed connection, of the unexpected upheavals that unsettle the calm of middle-class life, and of the challenges to the ideological foundations of Empire draw their strength from the novel's blend of intense realism and complex narrative technique. In this Readers' Guide, Betty Jay considers the establishment of Forster's reputation and the various attempts of critics to decipher the complex codes that are a feature of his novel. Successive chapters focus on debates around Forster's liberal-humanism, with essays from F. R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling and Malcolm Bradbury; on the indeterminacy and ambiguity of the text, with extracts from essays by Gillian Beer, Robert Barratt, Wendy Moffat and Jo-Ann Hoeppner Moran; and on the sexual politics of Forster's work, with writings from Elaine Showalter, Frances L. Restuccia and Eve Dawkins Poll. The Guide concludes with essays from Jeffrey Meyers and Jenny Sharpe, who read A Passage to India in terms of its engagement with British imperialism.",,,,1998.0,,,184046027X,9781840460278,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eyga_7KoLpgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.56,,,,,,,,,176.0,,,108.0,,,['Betty Jay']

"English Women's Clothing in the Nineteenth Century: A Comprehensive Guide with 1,117 Illustrations",,"['Fashion', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Reference', 'Research', 'Historical']","The nineteenth century was a period of continuous change for women's clothing in England. The growing prosperity of the merchant class meant an ever-larger number of women for whom ""dress"" was a principal function in life, while the increasing availability of lower-priced ready-made garments enabled women of moderate means to purchase the fashions of the day. In addition, the development of the railways spurred the spread of new goods, while the removal of the tax on papers in 1854 produced an abundance of fashion magazines at cheap prices, bringing news of the latest styles to the multitudes.The magnificent array of ladies' fashions that characterized the century are on display in this remarkably complete decade-by-decade overview. Drawing almost exclusively on contemporary sources — fashion magazines, newspapers, rare period photographs, memoirs, Victorian novels, periodicals, and other publications, as well as firsthand observation of actual garments — the author describes and explains the couture that evolved in response to changing social conditions, technological innovations, and cultural developments.Over 1,100 line and tone drawings and photographs depict hundreds of outfits ranging from lovely morning dresses and starkly attractive riding outfits to elegant carriage costumes, opulent evening dresses, and exquisite bridal gowns. Full-page plates also depict period millinery, footwear, underclothing, and other apparel, while three useful glossaries provide descriptions of materials, definitions of technical terms, and more.Museum curators, vintage clothes collectors, and fashion historians will find this carefully researched and well-written book an indispensable tool for dating, identifying, and authenticating vintage clothing. Not only are styles described and illustrated in detail for each year; all the small details of construction by which specimens can be dated are given wherever possible. Moreover, designers, illustrators, and fashion enthusiasts will be delighted by the superbly detailed illustrations, which painstakingly document the fashionable finery of the Victorian era.",,,,May 1st 1990,[],Paperback,,9780486263236,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328867911l/1069451.jpg,4.22,[],96.0,1.0,,,,94.0,77.0,576,Dover Publications,"['37', '26', '9', '4', '1']",,[],,['C.

Escape,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Biography Memoir', 'Cults', 'Autobiography', 'Polygamy', 'True Crime', 'Adult']","The dramatic first-person account of life inside an ultra-fundamentalist American religious sect, and one woman’s courageous flight to freedom with her eight children.When she was eighteen years old, Carolyn Jessop was coerced into an arranged marriage with a total stranger: a man thirty-two years her senior. Merril Jessop already had three wives. But arranged plural marriages were an integral part of Carolyn’s heritage: She was born into and raised in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), the radical offshoot of the Mormon Church that had settled in small communities along the Arizona-Utah border. Over the next fifteen years, Carolyn had eight children and withstood her husband’s psychological abuse and the watchful eyes of his other wives who were locked in a constant battle for supremacy.Carolyn’s every move was dictated by her husband’s whims. He decided where she lived and how her children would be treated. He controlled the money she earned as a school teacher. He chose when they had sex; Carolyn could only refuse—at her peril. For in the FLDS, a wife’s compliance with her husband determined how much status both she and her children held in the family. Carolyn was miserable for years and wanted out, but she knew that if she tried to leave and got caught, her children would be taken away from her. No woman in the country had ever escaped from the FLDS and managed to get her children out, too. But in 2003, Carolyn chose freedom over fear and fled her home with her eight children. She had $20 to her name.Escape exposes a world tantamount to a prison camp, created by religious fanatics who, in the name of God, deprive their followers the right to make choices, force women to be totally subservient to men, and brainwash children in church-run schools. Against this background, Carolyn Jessop’s flight takes on an extraordinary, inspiring power. Not only did she manage a daring escape from a brutal environment, she became the first woman ever granted full custody of her children in a contested suit involving the FLDS. And in 2006, her reports to the Utah attorney general on church abuses formed a crucial part of the case that led to the arrest of their notorious leader, Warren Jeffs.",,,,October 16th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780767927567,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442640131l/818811._SY475_.jpg,3.97,[],397.0,5.0,,,,94.0,37839.0,413,Broadway Books,"['12203', '15020', '8329', '1679', '608']",,[],,"['Carolyn Jessop', 'Laura Palmer']"
Ecology,,['Philosophy'],"As we survey the effects of modernism—environmental destruction, the net consumption of irreplaceable natural resources, the ever-widening gulf between first and third worlds—we are forced to grapple with the consequences of the domination of nature by human beings. The readings gathered here join these issues with critical theory to examine the ongoing struggle to rediscover the nature within human beings and to reconnect it with external nature.Starting with an examination of the use of modernist thought as legitimation for the domination of nature, the collection progresses on a broad front: It examines how first-world economies create third-world dependency; the connections between poverty and population; how basic needs could be fulfilled in a green sustainable economy; the debate among deep, social, and socialist ecologists over the new ecological worldview; ecofeminism and the liberation of both women and nature; environmental justice for minorities and third-world peoples; the need for new spiritual relations between people and nature; and a new postmodern science that offers people a partnership with nature. The conclusion presents the ""Principles of Environmental Justice,"" adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit.Each essay stands on its own as a contribution to the ecological debate, but the cumulative effect is clearly to ask how critical theorists, current environmental philosophers, and scientists propose to liberate both human beings and nature.",,,1994,August 1st 1994,[],Paperback,,9781573926003,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365463374l/340383.jpg,3.76,[],15.0,1.0,,,,86.0,37.0,397,Humanity Books,"['12', '11', '9', '3', '2']",,[],,"['Carolyn Merchant', 'Roger S.

    A LONG-OUT-OF-PRINT CLASIC BY A MASTER OF UNDERGROUND COMICS
    In the late 1980s, the idiosyncratic Chester Brown (author of the muchlauded Paying for It and Louis Riel) began writing the cult classic comic book series Yummy Fur. Within its pages, he serialized the groundbreaking Ed the Happy Clown, revealing a macabre universe of parallel dimensions. Thanks to its wholly original yet disturbing story lines, Ed set the stage for Brown to become a world-renowned cartoonist. Ed the Happy Clown is a hallucinatory tale that functions simultaneously as a dark roller-coaster ride of criminal activity and a scathing condemnation of religious and political charlatanism. As the world around him devolves into madness, the eponymous Ed escapes variously from a jealous boyfriend, sewer monsters, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a janitor with a Jesus complex. Brown leaves us wondering, with every twist of the plot, just how Ed will get out of this scrape. The intimate, tangled world of Ed the Happy Clown is definitively presented here, repackaged with a new foreword by the author and an extensive notes section, and is, like every Brown book, astonishingly perceptive about the zeitgeist of its time.

Exit Unicorns,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Ireland', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Irish Literature', 'Historical Romance', 'Adult Fiction']","In this sweeping and powerful epic the journey begins in the 'terrible beauty' of Northern Ireland during a time when conflict reigns and no one is spared from tragedy and sorrow, the time known as The Troubles. It is the spring of 1968 in Belfast and James Kirkpatrick has just lost his father under suspicious circumstances, Casey Riordan is released from prison after five years and Pamela O'Flaherty has crossed an ocean and a lifetime of memories to find the man she fell in love with as a little girl. All three lives are on a collision course with each other against the backdrop of the burgeoning civil rights movement and a nation on the brink of revolution. They come from disparate backgrounds-Jamie a wealthy aristocrat whose life is like an imperfect but multi-faceted jewel-brilliant, flawed and with a glitter that is designed to distract the observer. Casey, a card-carrying member of the Irish Republican Army, who must face the fact that five years away has left him a stranger, a misfit in his own neighborhood where not everyone is sympathetic to a convicted rebel. Pamela, who has come to Ireland in search of a memory and a man who may not have existed in the first place. Through it all runs the ribbon of a love story: love of country, the beginning love of two people unable to resist the pull of each other regardless of the cost to themselves and those around them, and the selfless love of one man who no longer believes himself capable of such emotion. It is an electrifying tale of a people divided by religion and politics, a tale of love and danger, of triumph and tragedy.

Elementary Structures of Kinship,,"['Anthropology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Sociology', 'Social Science', 'Science', 'Theory', 'Academia', 'France', 'Politics']","Professor Levi-Strauss's first major work, Les Structures elementaires de la Parente, has acquired a classic reputation since its original publication in 1949; and it has become the constant focus of academic debate about central theoretical concerns in social anthropology. It is, however, a long and difficult book for many students to read in French, and its arguments have consequently become known, even among professional anthropologists, largely through critical analysis. It was republished in a revised French edition in 1967 with a new foreword by the author, and it is this text with his further emendations that has been used in this translation.Levi-Strauss applies his intellectual powers to the perennial problem of incest, which he elucidates by means of the concept of exchange as formulated by Marcel Mauss in his famous analysis of the gift (Essai sur le don, 1925). He distinguishes two elementary modes of exchange which govern not only the conventional variety of goods and services but also the transfer of women in marriage: these are ""restricted"" and ""generalized"" exchange. With a mass of ethnographic evidence he demonstrates how the formidable intricacy of marriage customs, comprising moral and jural ideas and institutions (which appear to be essentially arbitrary), can be seen as local and historical rules of exchange.Charles Levi-Strauss traces these rules throughout a vast range of simple societies, chiefly in Australia and mainland Southeast Asia but also in the Americas, in Oceania, and in other parts of the world. To this survey he adds two extended sections on the great civilizations of China and India. He continues with a briefer consideration of the passage from elementary to complex structures, with particular reference to African societies, and concludes with a stimulating chapter on the principles of kinship, exchange as the universal basis for marriage prohibitions, and the formal relations between the sexes as part of a universe of communication.Although much of the work is technical, consisting of detailed analyses of types of social organization with which social anthropologists will be most familiar, it also contains much that will be of interest to psychologists, linguists, and philosophers, and to all who are interested in the possibility and the technique of the structural analysis of human activity. After the successes, moreover, of Levi-Strauss's subsequent books--notably Structural Anthropology, Tristes Tropiques, Totemism,  and The Savage Mind--this new edition of the work which founded his present outstanding reputation will have additional value as a further means of contact with one of the original minds of this century.The translation has been made by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer, of the University of New England, Australia, and by Rodney Needham, of the University of Oxford. Dr. Needham also acted as general editor and supplied the work with a new general index. He is the translator of Levi-Strauss's Le Totemisme aujourd'hui and author of Structure and Sentiment (1962) and numerous papers which have contributed to the recognition of Professor Levi-Strauss's work in the English-speaking world.",,,11/06/47,June 30th 1971,[],Paperback,,9780807046692,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348572298l/714341.jpg,3.91,['Prix Paul Pelliot (1949)'],81.0,1.0,,,,92.0,196.0,584,Beacon Press,"['58', '79', '44', '14', '1']",,[],,['Claude Lévi-Strauss']

What emerges is an entirely new way to talk about being smart. The best news is that ""emotional literacy"" is not fixed early in life.

Echoes,,"['Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Chick Lit', 'Holocaust', 'War', 'Historical Romance', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction']","For the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer awakening. By glimmering Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. As the two built a new life together, Beata's past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler's terror threatens her life and family--even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced in hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines.

Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.David B. was born Pierre-François Beauchard in a small town near Orléans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-François learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family’s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-François’s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers’ experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-François through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe”s losing battle with epilepsy.

Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives,,"['Science', 'Evolution', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Popular Science', 'Nature', 'College']","What is the biological reason for gossip?For laughter? For the creation of art?Why do dogs have curly tails?What can microbes tell us about morality?These and many other questions are tackled by renowned evolutionist David Sloan Wilson in this witty and groundbreaking new book. With stories that entertain as much as they inform, Wilson outlines the basic principles of evolution and shows how, properly understood, they can illuminate the length and breadth of creation, from the origin of life to the nature of religion. Now everyone can move beyond the sterile debates about creationism and intelligent design to share Darwin’s panoramic view of animal and human life, seamlessly connected to each other.Evolution, as Wilson explains, is not just about dinosaurs and human origins, but about why all species behave as they do—from beetles that devour their own young, to bees that function as a collective brain, to dogs that are smarter in some respects than our closest ape relatives. And basic evolutionary principles are also the foundation for humanity’s capacity for symbolic thought, culture, and morality.In example after example, Wilson sheds new light on Darwin’s grand theory and how it can be applied to daily life. By turns thoughtful, provocative, and daringly funny, Evolution for Everyone addresses some of the deepest philosophical and social issues of this or any age. In helping us come to a deeper understanding of human beings and our place in the world, it might also help us to improve that world.",,,10/30/07,March 27th 2007,[],Hardcover,,9780385340212,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320436409l/159062.jpg,3.92,[],100.0,1.0,,,,92.0,798.0,400,Delacorte Press,"['274', '271', '188', '47', '18']",,[],,['David Sloan Wilson']

Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Tudor Period', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Biography Memoir', '16th Century', 'European History', 'Politics']","The legend of Elizabeth I, the untouchable, charismatic Virgin Queen, is a powerful and enduring one. Most biographies focus on the years of her reign, during which she proved herself as adept a ruler -- and as shrewd an operator -- as England had ever seen. But while the history of her rule is fascinating, the story of how her remarkable character was forged seems vital to a full understanding of the woman who led England into a new age of prosperity, power, and artistic achievement. David Starkey's Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne explores the terra incognita of Elizabeth's early years, and the result is nothing short of captivating.Starkey finds that Elizabeth's early years ran the gamut from days of snug security as the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and Henry's heir apparent, to the years of uncertainty after her mother's execution whenElizabeth was separated from court and virtually forgotten. She received a first-rate academic education, excelling in languages and rhetoric and exhibiting a strong interest in the Protestant religion her father had established in England. But the education she received from life itself would prove far more valuable for the monarch-to-be. After the death of Henry VIII and Edward VI (Elizabeth's half brother), Elizabeth's status as sister and would-be successor to the Catholic queen Mary put her in a dangerous position.It also put her in prison at Mary's command -- and perilously close to execution -- after plots to place Elizabeth on the throne were revealed. Starkey makes it clear that while others may have actually done the dirty work, Elizabeth was usually in the thick of these efforts. Her imprisonment taught her to cover her tracks, but it did not stop her maneuverings. While fervently professing her Catholic faith, she surrounded herself with Protestant advisers and attendants, and bided her time. She evaded another snare of her sister's when Mary attempted to neutralize Elizabeth by marrying her off to a Catholic Spaniard in exchange for naming Elizabeth her successor. Perhaps Elizabeth had learned early on from the plight of her mother that marriage had its drawbacks. Starkey, however, suggests that Elizabeth, in a moment of true regality, would not accept the crown if it came through bullying and capitulation. Again, Elizabeth bided her time.Her seeming patience -- for Starkey reveals that Elizabeth continued to plot -- paid off when Mary, never robust, entered her final illness. Elizabeth managed to convince the now irrational queen that she was, indeed, a staunch Catholic and vowed to preserve England as a Catholic realm. Upon Mary's death, Elizabeth ascended to the throne with no meaningful opposition, thereby beginning what would be a golden age, one of the most legendary reigns in history. Starkey lets us understand, for the first time, the forces that made her into the formidable woman -- and brilliant ruler -- that she would soon prove to be.",,,01/01/00,December 4th 2001,['Elizabeth I of England'],Paperback,,9780060959517,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1402027586l/134958.jpg,4.03,[],96.0,1.0,,,,94.0,14262.0,384,Harper Perennial,"['5308', '5337', '2727', '578', '312']",,[],,['David Starkey']

Making use of examples of familiar optical illusions and multi-stable drawings, Professor Ihde illustrates by way of careful and disciplined step-by-step analyses, how some of the main methodological procedures and epistemological concepts of phenomenology assume concrete relevance.

Harington's novel succeeds admirably. This despite the fact the book could aptly be subtitled ""variation on a theme (and the life) of Nabokov."" Both allusionary and illusionary, it centers around a Georgian (as in the former USSR) princess/mycologist/dissident who arrives in the United States with a rudimentary knowledge of English, a passion for pubescent boys, and a deep-seated fear that her Russian psychiatrist tormentor, Bolshakov, is still on her trail. With the help of a ghost and an alcoholic art historian-cum-novelist, she discovers her own talent for fiction and makes enough money to take over a suite of rooms in an old mountain resort hotel (a la Nabokov).

E. Cummings was, next to Robert Frost, the most widely read poet in America. Combining Thoreau's controlled belligerence with the brash abandon of an uninhibited bohemian, Cummings, together with Pound, Eliot, and William Carlos Williams, helped bring about the twentieth-century revolution in literary expression. He is recognized on the one hand as the author of some of the most beautiful lyric poems written in the English language, and on the other as one of the most inventive American poets of his time in the worlds of Richard Kostelanetz, ""the major American poet of the middle-twentieth-century.""",,,10/05/91,April 17th 1994,[],Hardcover,,9780871401526,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355093052l/26596.jpg,4.35,[],94.0,1.0,,,,97.0,20268.0,1136,"Liveright/W.W.

Edgar Allan Poe Complete Tales and Poems,,Fiction,"The life of American writer Edgar Allan Poe was characterized by a dramatic series of successes and failures, breakdowns and recoveries, personal gains and hopes dashed through, despite which he created some of the finest literature the world has ever known. Over time his works have influenced such major creative forces as the French poets Charles Baudelaire and Andre Gide, filmmaker D.W. Griffith and modern literary legend Allen Ginsberg. Best known for his poems and short fiction, Poe perfected the psychological thriller, invented the detective story, and rarely missed transporting the reader to his own supernatural realm. He has also been hailed posthumously as one of the finest literary critics of the nineteenth century. In Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Tales and Poems fans may indulge in all of Poe's most imaginative short-stories, including The Fall of the House of Usher, The Murders in Rue Morgue, The Tell-Tale Heart, Ligeia and Ms. In a Bottle.

Using the language of the elemental world, he delineates a complex human intersection and transmutes cruelty into its opposite—a potent, lifegiving remedy.”—Alison Bechdel, author of Fun HomeFirst published in 1999, Exile & Pride established Eli Clare as one of the leading writers on the intersections of queerness and disability. With this critical tenth-anniversary edition, the groundbreaking publication secures its position as essential to the history of queer and disability politics, and, through significant new material that boldly interrogates and advances the original text, to its future as well. Clare’s writing on his experiences as a genderqueer activist/writer with cerebral palsy permanently changed the landscape of disability politics and queer liberation, and yet Exile & Pride is much too great in scope to be defined by even these two issues. Instead it offers an intersectional framework for understanding how our bodies actually experience the politics of oppression, power, and resistance. At the heart of Clare’s exploration of environmental destruction, white working-class identity, queer community, disabled sexuality, childhood sexual abuse, coalition politics, and his own gender transition is a call for social justice movements that are truly accessible for everyone.Blending prose and theory, personal experience and political debate, anger and compassion, Exile & Pride provides a window into a world where our whole selves in all their complexity can be loved and accepted.An award-winning poet and essayist, Eli Clare is also the author of The Marrow’s Telling.",,,,September 1st 1999,[],Paperback,,9780896086050,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328770006l/534753.jpg,4.36,[],65.0,1.0,,,,96.0,1665.0,147,South End Press,"['942', '472', '177', '49', '25']",,[],,"['Eli Clare', 'Suzanne Pharr']"

First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.",,,,2000.0,,,0805065377,9780805065374,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kQZYiLOJ8KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.02,,,,,,,,,336.0,,,8287.0,,,['Eliot Asinof']

"Eat, Pray, Love",,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Spirituality', 'Contemporary', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography']","A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.",,,02/16/06,02/01/07,"['Liz Gilbert', 'Felipe', 'Richard from Texas', 'Wayan']",Paperback,,9780143038412,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414l/19501.jpg,3.57,['Puddly Award for Nonfiction (2008)'],97131.0,1123.0,,,,81.0,1474731.0,368,Riverhead Books,"['411702', '410861', '368837', '170758', '112573']",,"['Italy', 'India', 'Bali (Indonesia)']",,['Elizabeth Gilbert']

Echoes of the Marseillaise,Two Centuries Look Back on the French Revolution,History,"""The French Revolution,"" writes Hobsbawm, ""gave peoples the sense that history could be changed by their action ... [and] demonstrated the power of the common people in a manner which no subsequent government has ever allowed itself to forget."" We can learn a great deal from studying the French Revolution itself, but we can also learn from studying the ways in which scholars have interpreted the French Revolution, and from the ways their views have changed. For over a century following the Revolution, commentators and scholars spoke of it in glowing terms. But in the past three decades, revisionist historians have become skeptical. Eric Hobsbawm reiterates the centrality of the Revolution for history on a global basis. He argues that those who wrote about the Revolution in the nineteenth century were convinced it had changed their lives dramatically, improving the economy and the lot of peasants. They saw the Revolution as a prototype of of the bourgeois revolution, enabling the middle class to gain power from the ruling class of aristocrats. Many believed proletarian revolutions would inevitably follow. In the years between 1917 and the 1960s, Marxists continued to use the French Revolution as a point of reference, paying increasing attention to the social and economic factors in the Revolution, not only to the political factors. In the 1970s and 1980s, many historians began to argue that the Revolution achieved modest results at disproportionate costs. Hobsbawm argues that this massive historiographical reaction against the centrality of the Revolution reflects the personal politics of those contemporary historians for whom Marxism and communism are now out of favor. They are, he maintains, wrong. The Revolution transformed the world permanently and introduced forces that continue to transform it.",,,,1990.0,,,0813515246,9780813515243,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3-XRo-PSwsQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.51,,,,,,,,,168.0,,,54.0,,,['Eric J.

Hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the “newest name after Wells, Verne, Huxley, and Orwell,” Callenbach offers a visionary blueprint for the survival of our planet . . . and our future.
  
  
Ecotopia was founded when northern California, Oregon, and Washington seceded from the Union to create a “stable-state” ecosystem: the perfect balance between human beings and the environment. Now, twenty years later, this isolated, mysterious nation is welcoming its first officially sanctioned American visitor: New York Times-Post reporter Will Weston.Skeptical yet curious about this green new world, Weston is determined to report his findings objectively. But from the start, he’s alternately impressed and unsettled by the laws governing Ecotopia’s earth-friendly agenda: energy-efficient “mini-cities” to eliminate urban sprawl, zero-tolerance pollution control, tree worship, ritual war games, and a woman-dominated government that has instituted such peaceful revolutions as the twenty-hour workweek and employee ownership of farms and businesses. His old beliefs challenged, his cynicism replaced by hope, Weston meets a sexually forthright Ecotopian woman and undertakes a relationship whose intensity will lead him to a critical choice between two worlds.

El túnel,,"['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Spanish Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Latin American', 'Latin American Literature', 'School', '20th Century', 'Thriller']","Breve e intensa novela publicada en 1948, este logrado fruto de la denominada ""literatura existencial"" le dio a su autor un reconocimiento que traspasó las fronteras nacionales. Para quien todavía no la leyó, El túnel es la mejor introducción al universo prodigioso de Ernesto Sábato; para quien la conoce, un clásico de las letras del continente, una historia sobre el drama del hombre arrojado en el sinsentido más doloroso: la conciencia de la nada. El narrador describe una historia de amor y muerte en la que muestra la soledad del individuo contemporáneo. No están ausentes de esta trama policial y de suspenso, la locura y la increíble reflexión del protagonista, el pintor Juan Pablo Castel, debatiéndose por comprender las causas que lo arrastraron a matar a la mujer que amaba, María Iribarne, y que era su única vía de salvación. En este alucinante drama de la vida interior, seres intrincados en la bestial búsqueda de comprensión ceden a la mentira, la hipocresía y los celos desmedidos hasta el crimen más inexplicable. Aventura amorosa, aventura onírica, aventura del ser que dan testimonio de un asesinato, de cierta memoria culpable y de una valiente introspección.

Eumeswil,,"['Philosophy', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'German Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'Germany']","Originally published in Germany in 1977, when Junger was eighty-two years old, Eumeswil is the great novel of Junger's creative maturity, a masterpiece by a central figure in modern German literature. Eumeswil is a utopian state ruled by the Condor, a general who has installed himself as a dictator and who dominates the capital from a guarded citadel atop a hill - the Casbah. A refined manipulator of power, the Condor despises the democrats who conspire against him. Venator, the narrator of the novel, is a historian whose discreet and efficient services as the Condor's night steward earn him full access to the forbidden zone, at the very heart of power. Every evening, while attending to the Condor and his guests at the Casbah's night bar, Venator keeps a secret journal in which he records the conversations he overhears, delineating the diverse personalities in the Condor's entourage while sketching out an analysis of the different aspects of the psychology of power. Venator's days are spent building a hidden refuge in the mountains, a hermetic retreat where he hopes one day to realize his dreams of utter self-sufficiency. In the meantime, however, he continues to pursue his career as a historian, using the magnificent tool that has been placed at his disposal - the ""luminar"", a holographic instrument that can summon up any figure or event in human history. Venator, in a word, embodies Junger's ideal of the ""anarch"" - a heroic figure whose radical skepticism and individualism are not to be confused with mere anarchism. Around the opposite figures of the dictator and the anarch, Junger weaves a hallucinatory and poetic rumination on the nature of history and on the mainsprings of political power. At once tale, essay and philosophical poem, Eumeswil offers a desolate and lucid assessment of totalitarianism by an author who witnessed its horrors firsthand.",,,10/30/77,May 1st 1994,[],Hardcover,,9780941419970,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175327825l/506145.jpg,4.31,[],100.0,1.0,,,,96.0,277.0,384,Marsilio Publishers,"['145', '90', '31', '6', '5']",,[],,"['Ernst Jünger', 'Joachim Neugroschel']"

Eve’s Hollywood is an album of  vivid snapshots of Southern California’s haute bohemians, of outrageously beautiful high-school ingenues and enviably tattooed Chicanas, of rock stars sleeping it off at the Chateau Marmont. And though Babitz’s prose might appear careening, she’s in control as she takes us on a ride through an LA of perpetual delight, from a joint serving the perfect taquito, to the corner of La Brea and Sunset where we make eye contact with a roller-skating hooker, to the Watts Towers.

O these fashionable people!' Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions - as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story.

Evelina,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', '18th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'School']","Frances Burney's first and most enduringly popular novel is a vivid, satirical, and seductive account of the pleasures and dangers of fashionable life in late eighteenth-century London. As she describes her heroine's entry into society, womanhood and, inevitably, love, Burney exposes the vulnerability of female innocence in an image-conscious and often cruel world where social snobbery and sexual aggression are played out in the public arenas of pleasure-gardens, theatre visits, and balls. But Evelina's innocence also makes her a shrewd commentator on the excesses and absurdities of manners and social ambitions--as well as attracting the attention of the eminently eligible Lord Orville. Evelina, comic and shrewd, is at once a guide to fashionable London, a satirical attack on the new consumerism, an investigation of women's position in the late eighteenth century, and a love story. The new introduction and full notes to this edition help make this richness all the more readily available to a modern reader.",,"Oxford World's Classics, New Edition",10/28/78,July 18th 2002,"['Evelina Anville', 'Rev.

Endgame: Bobby Fischer's Remarkable Rise and Fall - From America's Brightest Prodigy to the Edge of Madness,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Chess', 'History', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Games', 'American History', 'Psychology']","Endgame is acclaimed biographer Frank Brady’s decades-in-the-making tracing of the meteoric ascent—and confounding descent—of enigmatic genius Bobby Fischer.  Only Brady, who met Fischer when the prodigy was only 10 and shared with him some of his most dramatic triumphs, could have written this book, which has much to say about the nature of American celebrity and the distorting effects of fame.  Drawing from Fischer family archives, recently released FBI files, and Bobby’s own emails, this account is unique in that it limns Fischer’s entire life—an odyssey that took the Brooklyn-raised chess champion from an impoverished childhood to the covers of Time, Life and Newsweek to recognition as “the most famous man in the world” to notorious recluse. At first all one noticed was how gifted Fischer was.  Possessing a 181 I.Q. and remarkable powers of concentration, Bobby memorized hundreds of chess books in several languages, and he was only 13 when he became the youngest chess master in U.S. history.   But his strange behavior started early.  In 1972, at the historic Cold War showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland, where he faced Soviet champion Boris Spassky, Fischer made headlines with hundreds of petty demands that nearly ended the competition.  It was merely a prelude to what was to come. Arriving back in the United States to a hero’s welcome, Bobby was mobbed wherever he went—a figure as exotic and improbable as any American pop culture had yet produced.  No player of a mere “board game” had ever ascended to such heights.  Commercial sponsorship offers poured in, ultimately topping $10 million—but Bobby demurred.  Instead, he began tithing his limited money to an apocalyptic religion and devouring anti-Semitic literature.   After years of poverty and a stint living on Los Angeles’ Skid Row, Bobby remerged in 1992 to play Spassky in a multi-million dollar rematch—but the experience only deepened a paranoia that had formed years earlier when he came to believe that the Soviets wanted him dead for taking away “their” title.  When the dust settled, Bobby was a wanted man—transformed into an international fugitive because of his decision to play in Montenegro despite U.S. sanctions.  Fearing for his life, traveling with bodyguards, and wearing a long leather coat to ward off knife attacks, Bobby lived the life of a celebrity fugitive – one drawn increasingly to the bizarre.  Mafiosi, Nazis, odd attempts to breed an heir who could perpetuate his chess-genius DNA—all are woven into his late-life tapestry.  And yet, as Brady shows, the most notable irony of Bobby Fischer’s strange descent – which had reached full plummet by 2005 when he turned down yet another multi-million dollar payday—is that despite his incomprehensible behavior, there were many who remained fiercely loyal to him.  Why that was so is at least partly the subject of this book—one that at last answers the question: “Who was Bobby Fischer?”",,,,February 1st 2011,['Bobby Fischer'],ebook,,9780307463920,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1299772242l/10290752.jpg,3.95,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)'],64.0,1.0,,,,91.0,9172.0,416,Broadway Books,"['3334', '3229', '1766', '509', '334']",,[],,['Frank Brady']

Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen: brev juli-december 1920,,[],"En ny volym i sviten Franz Kafkas samlade skrifter. Denna volym har fått titeln Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen och innehåller brev som Kafka skrev under perioden juli till december 1920. För översättning och kommentarer står Hans Blomqvist och Erik Ågren.När volymen börjar har Kafka just återvänt till Prag efter sitt omvälvande kärleksmöte med Milena Jesenská i Wien. Under fyra dagar har de äntligen - efter flera månader av allt intimare korrespondens - fått rå om varandra helt och hållet, fyra för Kafka ofattbart lyckliga dagar. Han är djupt förälskad (""jag är fullständigt uppslukad av dig"") och nu kan han inte få nog av att skriva brev efter brev till Milena, inte få nog av att i detalj fästa på papper vad han tänker och känner. Det blir minst ett långt brev per dag, ofta två, ibland tre.Det första han gör vid återkomsten till Prag är att ta itu med vad han kallar ""ett bödelsgöra"". Han söker upp Julie Wohryzek som sedan ett halvår tillbaka är hans fästmö och bryter förlovningen med henne. Det känns hårt, det känns brutalt, men det är nödvändigt, och det är nödvändigt att det sker omedelbart. Tanken är att Milena lika resolut ska kräva skilsmässa från sin man, Ernst Pollak. Men så verkar det inte bli...Kafkas brev till Milena Jesenská är något av det mest gripande man kan läsa. Denne store välformulerade författare stiger - förlöst av den kärlek han känner ? in i det innersta av sitt eget känsloliv och uttrycker, rakt på sak och med blixtrande skärpa, vad han i ögonblicket upplever. Kärleken till Milena har fått hela Franz Kafkas numera så omtalat mörka världsbild att plötsligt ljusna riktigt ordentligt. ""Eftersom jag älskar dig älskar jag hela världen.""Kafka kämpar sedan 1917 med tuberkulos och vistas i omgångar på sanatorier. Men just nu, under sommaren 1920, är det precis som om tuberkulosen har upphört eller tagit en paus. Enligt Milena är det som om han inte lider av mer än ""en lättare förkylning"".Samtidigt står det klart att den kärlek han känner till Milena inte har mildrat hans hårda syn på sig själv. Hans självhat finns kvar. ""Smutsig är jag Milena, otroligt smutsig, därför tjatar jag så mycket om renhet. Inga sjunger så rent som de som befinner sig längst ner i helvetet, det vi tror är änglars sång är i själva verket deras sång.""Hans Blomqvist och Erik Ågren har tilldelats Stiftelsen Natur och Kulturs översättarpris och Samfundet De Nios översättarpris för sitt arbete med Franz Kafkas samlade skrifter.

EDICIÓN ESPECIAL DE CIENCIA FICCIÓN. G.G.MELIES.: TRES LIBROS EN UNO.,,[]," 
  Compilado de tres libros en uno de Ciencia Ficción. 
  Ciencia ficción contemporánea y racionalista de G.G.Melies. Una muy buena y abundante elección para fanáticos del género. En esta edición G.G.Melies nos entrega tres libros de historias originales y distintas, donde le será absolutamente imposible predecir el nudo y el desenlace que lo tomarán por sorpresa. El desarrollo de la historia es una de las características del autor, que busca siempre mantenerse dentro de la senda del racionalismo sin llegar a la Sci Fi fantástica y carente de fundamentos aceptables. El tramado del relato dentro de los parámetros de la realidad, las hipótesis actuales de la física y el conocimiento es una de las caracteristicas que lo enmarcan.  
  Teoría rudimentaria sobre estados entrelazados y gemelos.
  Scott y Andrew, gemelos separados por las distancias entre la Tierra y Marte, pueden presentirse el uno al otro cuando están en peligro con mayor rapidez de lo que tardan las comunicaciones entre ambos planetas. Inspirado en el libro de Alejandro Dumas ""Los hermanos corsos"" esta novela ambientada en una colonia de Marte y en la Tierra luego de las Greenwars (movimientos eco-terroristas pro planeta donde milita Andrew) traza un paralelismo entre la comunicación de partículas cuánticas y la mente humana desde la concepción.  
  40° Rugientes, 50° Furiosos, 60° Aulladores. Paranoia por asistencia gravitatoria.
  Ficción náutica que toma matices de ciencia ficción en capítulos avanzados, y muestra un sutil paralelismo entre la exploración marina y espacial. Lara y Julio, una pareja recién casada se embarca en una luna de miel de aventuras en un martes trece del año 2213 rumbo a Cabo de Hornos. Es un viaje temático ambientado en 1933 en una vieja goleta de madera de esa época, desprovista de tecnología y donde deberán dejarla antes de abordar. La nave llamada ""Destino"" perteneciente a la familia de Álvaro, un particular Capitán fanático de la edad de oro de la ciencia ficción, carga ese romanticismo que le otorga su dueño y también tiene sus reglas de convivencia. Una novela con humor y aventura donde el mix de personajes del pasaje lo divertirá en sus conflictos de convivencia en las aguas más peligrosas del planeta.  
  ALGOCRACIA CUÁNTICA. Las conciencias muertas de Sagitario A*
  Es un sueño de utopía perfecta para la humanidad. G.G.Melies plantea que tal vez no haya que temer a las inteligencias artificiales sino pisar el acelerador. Es la obra más política y fantástica sin perder la racionalidad debido al contexto futuro que la enmarca; dos crones de aquí en más.

El cierre del periódico para el que trabajaba le sumió en la pobreza, mientras redactaba en tres versiones distintas esta excepcional novela, que fue rechazada por varios editores antes de su publicación. Tras el barroquismo faulkneriano de La hojarasca, esta segunda novela supone un paso hacia la ascesis, hacia la economía expresiva, y el estilo del escritor se hace más puro y transparente.

Elusive Dawn,,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical']","It happened slowly at first. Thread by thread, the fabric of privilege and complacency enveloping the Wyndham family began to unravel. A carefree summer at their island house, disrupted by the arrival of long lost kin, ended in tragedy, betrayal, and war. Now, in the compelling sequel to the acclaimed epic, The Summer Before The Storm, Ria and her friends find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control. It's late summer, 1916. While some members of the Wyndham family revel in the last resplendent days of the season at their Muskoka cottage, others continue to be drawn inexorably into the Great War, going from a world of misty sunrises across a tranquil lake to deadly moonlight bombing raids, festering trenches, and visceral terror. For Ria, too many things have happened to hope that life would ever return to normal, that innocence could be regained. Caught in a vortex of turbulent events and emotions, she abandons the safety of the sidelines in Britain for the nightmare of France. Her fate as an ambulance driver remains entwined with those of her summer friends, all bound by a sense of duty. Living in the shadows of fear and danger awakens the urgency to grasp life, to live more immediately, more passionately amid the enormity of unprecedented death. Together, their lives weave a tale of liberation and loss, evolution and redemption. Those who survive this cataclysmic time are forever changed, like Canada itself.Impeccably researched, beautifully written, Elusive Dawn will resonate with the reader long after the final page has been turned.",Muskoka Trilogy #2,,10/30/08,November 28th 2008,[],Paperback,,9780973278033,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348781229l/6359649.jpg,4.35,[],99.0,1.0,,,,98.0,48.0,555,Mindshadows,"['21', '24', '2', '1', '0']",,['Canada'],,['Gabriele Wills']

"Eternal Darkness, Blood King",,"['Vampires', 'Horror', 'Paranormal']","Get ready for the ultimate showdown between fangs and pure evil!It's evil versus evil when Renzo, a proud immortal, who wonders if there still is some shred of human emotion inside of him, faces an ancient evil force, who seems to be as powerful as he is, with the perfect bait; the secret of how to turn immortals back into mortals in exchange for Renzo's soul. ""Immortality is not easy"" - says Renzo, a vampire, several times in the book more as a warning than an explanation. The fact of conquering death must have a powerful effect inside anyone's mind. How an immortal of any kind could believe in any type of deities, beliefs, myths or any other human concept regarding the afterlife? In the same way, how come someone who defies all laws of nature and those of physics can validate an improbability like that ""it"" we call soul? That's the core of ""Eternal Darkness, Blood King."" From the beginning the story sounds familiar; the vampire with a story to tell, but all similarities end when the plot quickly transforms into something deeper with an array of fascinating characters; like Frank Lopez, a seventy year old alcoholic, cannibal and psychic whose mental power only increases by the consumption of human flesh; specially if it comes from children. Also, Jason Drake and Julia Saravova; Renzo's loyal protégés and eternal twenty something vampires with a taste for violence. Maximilian Hunter; an ex-USMC captain on a man-hunt trying to stop Renzo without fully realizing what he's getting himself into. The young Lucy Buren; a gifted artists and Renzo's business associate who knows the truth about Renzo but refuses to walk away from their friendship. Erika Foster; a tragic teenager with a mysterious past and on a mission. Jean Charles Reneu and Amy Harlow; a pair of millionaire ""collectors"" obsessed with capturing Renzo and unlock the mystery of his immortality, and a tactical unit of mercenaries trying to destroy ""the most dangerous of all creatures"" are the elements of this vampire epic tale. When Renzo decides to accept to trade his soul he asks;""who cares to whom my inexistent soul belongs to when I will go on living forever?” The answer to his question will take the reader to a surprising journey beyond faith, the mysteries of immortality and time itself. ""Eternal Darkness, Blood King"" is a true feast for all vampire lovers, and a new take on the immortal lore with unexpected twists and turns that will leave the reader asking for more.",,First edition,,December 14th 2012,[],ebook,,9781301796861,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355867879l/17155673.jpg,3.37,[],200.0,2.0,,,,78.0,46.0,446,Demar Communications,"['12', '8', '16', '5', '5']",,[],,['Gadriel Demartinos']

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him.

The writing is creative, thought-provoking and seemingly effortless. I highly recommend this book to all readers. It’s a story that will keep you totally immersed and take you places that will astound you.” —Marilou George, The Kindle Book ReviewDEATH IN THE BEGINNING (THE GOD TOOLS: BOOK 1)""Science, spirituality and the supernatural collide in this break-out debut thriller, with an action-packed storyline so tightly woven, you won’t be able to catch your breath until the very end. It’s a delicious, twisting journey unlike any I have read.” —CK Webb, co-author of “Cruelty to Innocents” and “Collecting Innocents”THREE KEYS TO MURDER “Three Keys to Murder” is a riveting roller coaster ride, complete with non-stop action, intriguing characters, and an amazing plot line. Up until now, I’ve always thought that “The Da Vinci Code” had the perfect flow for a murder mystery novel, sending the lead character on a quest to connect history with artifacts, but in retrospect, I think “Three Keys to Murder” might just top “The Da Vinci Code.” Thus, if you’re a lover of “The Da Vinci Code,” then Williams’ and Knerly’s novel is a must read!

The scope of his inquiry ranges from Emily Bronte to Sade, from St. Therese to Claude Levi-Strauss, and Dr. Kinsey; and the subjects he covers include prostitution, mythical ecstasy, cruelty, and organized war. Investigating desire prior to and extending beyond the realm of sexuality, he argues that eroticism is ""a psychological quest not alien to death."""" . . . one of the most original and unsettling of those thinkers who, in the wake of Sade and Nietzsche, have confronted the possibility of thought in a world that has lost its myth of transcendence."" — Peter Brooks, New York Times Book Review""Bataille is one of the most important writers of the century."" — Michel Foucault""[An] urgent, thrusting book about love, sex, death and spirituality by Georges Bataille."" — Mark Price, Philosophy Now",,,10/30/57,January 1st 2001,[],Paperback,,9780872861909,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312228434l/37530.jpg,4.08,[],164.0,2.0,,,,94.0,2424.0,288,City Lights Publishers,"['957', '890', '441', '94', '42']",,[],,"['Georges Bataille', 'Mary Dalwood']"
Egyptian Myth: A Very Short Introduction,,History,"Egyptian myths articulated the core values of one of the longest lasting civilizations in history, and myths of deities such as Isis and Osiris influenced contemporary cultures and became part of the Western cultural heritage. Egyptian Mythology: A Very Short Introduction explains the cultural and historical background to the fascinating and complex world of Egyptian myth, with each chapter dealing with a particular theme. To show the variety of source material for Egyptian myth, each chapter features a particular object--such as the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle, a golden statue of Tutankhamun, and a papyrus containing a story in which the Egyptian gods behave outrageously--which is illustrated by a photograph or line-drawing. The myth ""The Contendings of Horus and Seth"" is looked at in detail, and the many interpretations it has provoked are examined. In addition to a list of major deities and myths, there are explanations of related topics such as how hieroglyphs work, royal names and titles, and the Egyptian cosmos. There is also a timeline of Egyptian history, a glossary of technical terms and an up-to-date bibliography.",,,,2004.0,,,0192803468,9780192803467,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXkRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.62,,,,,,,,,143.0,,,178.0,,,['Geraldine Pinch']

Emilia Galotti,,"['Classics', 'Plays', 'German Literature', 'School', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Read For School', '18th Century', 'Germany', 'Literature']","Mit dem 1772 erschienenen und uraufgeführten Drama Emilia Galotti schuf Gotthold Ephraim Lessing eines der bedeutendsten Beispiele für die Gattung des bürgerlichen Trauerspiels. Das Stück, das zu den Schlüsselwerken der Aufklärung und Empfindsamkeit gehört sowie als eines der ersten politischen Dramen der deutschen Literatur gilt, übt scharfe Kritik an der Willkürherrschaft des Adels. Dieser Macht kann das Bürgertums nur seine höhere Moral entgegensetzen.

"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions",,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Personal Development', 'Management', 'Communication', 'Buisness']","Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas.A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.??A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.??A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers.This book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise ""wisdom of the crowd.""Kawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.As Kawasaki writes, ""Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do.""

"Ernest Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms""",,[],"As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with A Farewell to Arms. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fiancé of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits:  I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know.  The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he ""did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards."" Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine.  Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and A Farewell to Arms, like his other novels (For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Sun Also Rises, and To Have and Have Not), offers neither. What it does provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. --Alix Wilber",Bloom's Notes,,10/06/85,October 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,,9781604135725,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348391303l/6962816.jpg,3.8,[],90.0,1.0,,,,92.0,61.0,128,Chelsea House Publishers,"['15', '24', '17', '5', '0']",,[],,['Harold Bloom']

Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,,"['Economics', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Finance', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'History', 'Money', 'Audiobook']","A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",,,10/28/46,1979,[],Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1565397589l/3028._SX318_.jpg,4.21,[],618.0,7.0,,,,94.0,14974.0,218,Three Rivers Press,"['7285', '4658', '2152', '592', '287']",,[],,['Henry Hazlitt']

I started to become awareof how brutal the country is and how much ferocity, cruelty, and oppressionare inherent in the culture and how much of it was in me. I wanted todocument it and create a book that brought the whole thing to a boil and see where it left me off. In the summer of 1995, I finished the book and startedto edit.

The Grandet household, oppressed by the exacting miserliness of Grandet himself, is jerked violently out of routine by the sudden arrival of Eugenie's cousin Charles, recently orphaned and penniless. Eugenie's emotional awakening, stimulated by her love for her cousin, brings her into direct conflict with her father, whose cunning and financial success are matched against her determination to rebel. Eugenie's moving story is set against the backdrop of provincial oppression, the vicissitudes of the wine trade, and the workings of the financial system in the aftermath of the French Revolution. It is both a poignant portrayal of private life and a vigorous fictional document of its age.",La Comédie Humaine #30,Oxford World’s Classics,10/28/33,August 28th 2003,"['Eugénie Grandet', 'Félix Grandet', 'Charles Grandet', 'Cruchot des Bonfons', 'Nanon', 'Madame Grandet']",Paperback,,9780192804747,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388286601l/59142.jpg,3.8,[],489.0,8.0,,,,91.0,17727.0,200,Oxford University Press,"['4610', '6807', '4752', '1235', '323']",,"['Saumur (France)', 'France']",,"['Honoré de Balzac', 'Sylvia Raphael', 'Christopher Prendergast']"

Enduring Love,,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'Adult Fiction']","Joe planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside to celebrate his lover's return after 6 weeks in the States. The perfect day turns to nightmare however, when they are involved in freak ballooning accident in which a boy is saved but a man is killed. In itself, the accident would change the couple and the survivors' lives, filling them with an uneasy combination of shame, happiness, and endless self-reproach. But fate has far more unpleasant things in store for Joe. Meeting the eye of fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. For Jed is instantly obsessed, making the first of many calls to Joe and Clarissa's London flat that same night. Soon he's openly shadowing Joe and writing him endless letters. (One insane epistle begins, ""I feel happiness running through me like an electrical current. I close my eyes and see you as you were last night in the rain, across the road from me, with the unspoken love between us as strong as steel cable."") Worst of all, Jed's version of love comes to seem a distortion of Joe's feelings for Clarissa.  Apart from the incessant stalking, it is the conditionals--the contingencies--that most frustrate Joe, a scientific journalist. If only he and Clarissa had gone straight home from the airport... If only the wind hadn't picked up... If only he had saved Jed's 29 messages in a single day... Ian McEwan has long been a poet of the arbitrary nightmare, his characters ineluctably swept up in others' fantasies, skidding into deepening violence, and--worst of all--becoming strangers to those who love them. Even his prose itself is a masterful and methodical exercise in de-familiarisation. But Enduring Love and its underrated predecessor, Black Dogs, are also meditations on knowledge and perception as well as brilliant manipulations of our own expectations. By the novel's end, you will be surprisingly unafraid of hot-air balloons, but you won't be too keen on looking a stranger in the eye. --Alex Freeman",,,09/28/97,October 28th 2004,"['Joe Rose', 'Clarissa Mellon', 'Jed Parry', 'Jean Logan']",Paperback,,9780099481249,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1313656531l/6870.jpg,3.64,"['James Tait Black Memorial Prize Nominee for Fiction (1997)', 'International Dublin Literary Award Nominee for Shortlist (1999)']",351.0,5.0,,,,88.0,37763.0,245,Vintage,"['7489', '14795', '10917', '3366', '1196']",,"['London, England', 'England']",,['Ian McEwan']

Earth Sink,,[],"Earth Sink is a challenging and insightful read that demands an attentive mind and some awareness of the sociopolitical trends going on in America and around the world. Secret societies, banking cartels, and terrorist regimes have been funding and grooming political candidates for the highest offices of American government. A one man sleeper cell has been in play since 2008. The American people blindly voted him into position. Or did they? In a day when it is becoming a crime to worship Jesus Christ, signs of the times and biblical prophecies are unfolding at ever increasing rates. The story starts way back in a time veiled from your mind, when you fought a war you don't remember, a war for your very right to be born. Events playing out on Earth are extensions of that war. The original foes know you better than you know yourself, and they cannot be killed. They were never alive. The story is a fictional dramatization framed around principles of eternal truth. Earth Sink will penetrate your soul to the core. You will not be able to remain neutral or indifferent after reading this book in its entirety. The open minded reader will find answers to some of man’s most profound questions and will likely come away with even more questions and some intensely emotional opinions. Earth Sink contains personal dreams experienced by the author and is based in part on the author's dreams. It is written mostly in narrative form with very little dialog. The eternal future of every individual on earth, alive or dead, hangs in the balance. A simple vicarious work can tip the scales toward eternal life. The sheer volume of vicarious work to be done is astronomical. Scant few ever attempt it. Will they endure long enough to complete the work, or will they succumb to the swelling tides of evil? While offering insights into theological anthropology and eschatology, Earth Sink depicts the tragic results of prevailing modern societal trends. The book exposes the primordial roots of political influences operating works of darkness that drive a progressive global state of affairs that exclusively favors the world's elites at the expense of liberty and individual freedoms. Earth Sink warns about the deliberate dismantling of the United States constitution from the inside by a compromised and corrupted executive branch of American government collaborating with secret combinations of banking cartels, mega corporations, and terrorist organizations. The most powerful position in the world is handed over to diabolical figures bent on seating a world government that opposes every virtue that once set mankind above beasts. The catastrophic consequences of globalized mainstream sociopolitical movements leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ are unrelentingly drilled home in overwhelmingly graphic detail unleashed from the vivid and explosive imagination of the author. Earth Sink does not skimp on cataclysmic mayhem and apocalyptic doom. Take heed if you want to live. End times have already been underway longer than you realize. Earth Sink is a scathing and brutal portent. The author is absolutely unmindful of reader sensitivity. He employs no semblance of political correctness. Some readers may find parts of the story extremely disturbing, offensive, and controversial. Though written as fiction, the story alludes to the serious truth of what is going on around us and among us right now. In addition to whetting the inquisitive mind with a glimpse of cutting edge science and futuristic technologies, Earth Sink is both politically relevant and spiritually applicable to everyone. It describes a globalized society driven by influences that promote and then exploit worldwide pacifism, greed, envy, pride, and chaos which in turn drives a desperate need for change. Upon that desperate need for change, the world's elites slide into coveted positions of absolute power and total control while their bovine, unthinking constituents and porcine subjects wallow in passive complacency, recklessly relying on the mercies of those they have allowed to gain power over them. All will be well, or will it? Earth Sink extrapolates a possible future from past and present issues. Read the story as if it were real. Some of it is unequivocally real. Some of it may become real. Ponder it carefully and decide for yourself what is real and what is fiction. Beware, your time will soon run out. Earth Sink was written to do more than merely entertain. It was written as a wake up call to change lives, hopefully for the better.",,,,May 24th 2010,[],Paperback,,9780976800439,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1301480915l/10922494.jpg,3.25,[],100.0,1.0,,,,75.0,4.0,496,Ilyan Kei Lavanway,[],,[],,['Ilyan Kei Lavanway']

As a forensic sculptor, she is able to piece together bones, create a face, and bring an identity to a child who would have otherwise gone unidentified…maybe forever. Eve is brilliant, and driven, and tormented—because her own daughter, Bonnie, was taken from her years ago. And Eve has never discovered what happened to her.

Now, Catherine challenges Eve with a name: John Gallo. A man from Eve’s past. A man, seemingly raised from the dead, whose whereabouts are unknown. Could Gallo be the missing piece to the puzzle that has haunted Eve for years? Why was he in Atlanta just before Bonnie’s disappearance?

"Ex Ponto, Nemiri, Lirika",,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Serbian Literature']","=From the Sea, Riots, LyricsAndrić’s first published works were poems and he continued to write verse intermittenly all his life, altho much of it was unpublished until his death. His 1st poems appeared in the context of the Young Bosnia movement. The writing of its members is in marked contrast to their robust active personalities. The poems Andrić published before WWI are virtually indistinguishable in tone from much of what his contemporaries were writing. Nevertheless, it's probably true to say that in his case the role of the political activist, however sincerely he played it at the time, was fundamentally unsuited to him. By contrast, however, the prevailing melancholy seemed to match his temperamental reponse to the world. These early poems point in no particular direction, beyond establishing the free verse form of virtually all of Andrić’s poetry and a tendency to a mournful self-pity which sometimes threatens his personal statements. The prose poems written during the War represent a personal conffesion & cannot be considered merely the reflection of a literary vogue. “Ex Ponto” (refers to Ovid’s account of his Black Sea exile) was published in 1918; “Unrest” in 1920, when “Ex Ponto” was already reprinted. Thereafter Andrić refused to allow them to be included in any of his collections of his works published before his death. He rejected them because they seemed to him too intimate. But, they're important since they contain ideas & themes which recur in his later works. The strong emotional colouring was toned down in Andrić’s later prose poems & verse but their form, a combination of aphoristic statements & longer reflective passages, continued to appeal to him. “Ex Ponto” & “Unrest” record his emotional reaction to the circumstances of his early life & the development of a number of themes around the central paradox of his personality & work.",,,11/05/20,Published,[],Hardcover,,9788607010646,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328024621l/2230670.jpg,4.45,[],77.0,1.0,,,,97.0,615.0,276,Prosveta,"['376', '160', '63', '12', '4']",,[],,['Ivo Andrić']

The dangerous entity seems particularly interested in her clients’ ten-year-old daughter.Soon her own life is in danger, and Ellie must find a way to exorcise the darkness of the house before it can kill her, her clients, or their frightened young child.","Ellie Jordan, Ghost Trapper #1",,08/27/14,September 13th 2014,[],ebook,,9781311874344,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456615163l/23246025._SY475_.jpg,4.08,[],88.0,1.0,,,,95.0,4517.0,,Smashwords,"['1761', '1695', '815', '172', '74']",,[],,['J.

Elysian Fields (The End #1),,[],"Revelation 6:8“And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. What if you awakened tomorrow and the world as you knew it had changed?The event happened worldwide on October 31 at 5:55 A.M. People got out of bed to find their loved ones or neighbors had fallen in the middle of their morning routines, or never made it out of bed at all. As the body count began to reach staggering numbers the world stood still. It was at the precipice of the growing panic that the world began to come apart. There were no answers. Was it a disease? Was this actually the end as it was written in the bible? No one knew, but one thing was for sure: It had only just begun.Frank Pearson had seen the worst the world could offer, and had become a monster to survive it. He had served two tours as a ranger, and two as a delta operator. Yet the ghosts had a habit of following you. No matter how far you ran. They always caught up to you. So when Frank had finally had enough he had shuffled out and came back home. Jacobs Ladder, Texas had always been that to him. It was the small town affair that he liked. It was small enough that when his mom had told her neighbor that her son was coming home, the chief was waiting on him. Harry had held out that gold star and never asked for and answer. Frank had been serving and protecting ever since.Felix Cherry had been all about affliction. He had only been a child when he lost the use of his legs to a rare auto-immune disease. He had devoted his life to solving riddles of the universe, and providing the answers that came with them. It had only been a matter of time until he climbed the ladder of leadership at the Center for Disease Control. When the event happened, the powers that be handed him the reins and ran for cover. Felix had always been for adapt and overcome. Yet he wasn’t entirely sure there was an answer to this particular riddle.The world was driven for answers. The social media outlets and internet was a buzz with pictures and stories of people who had lost loved ones. So many likes and comments poured in as the day rolled on. Yet there were no answers. The governments of the world had parlayed their differences to find the culprit, but no blame could be found. There was no answer why.

Empire Of The Clouds: When Britain's Aircraft Ruled The World,,"['History', 'Aviation', 'Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Aircraft', 'Military History', 'Science', 'British Literature', 'Engineering']","In 1945, Britain was the world's leading designer and builder of aircraft - a world-class achievement that was not mere rhetoric. And what aircraft they were. The sleek Comet, the first jet airliner. The awesome delta-winged Vulcan, an intercontinental bomber that could be thrown about the sky like a fighter. The Hawker Hunter, the most beautiful fighter-jet ever built and the Lightning, which could zoom ten miles above the clouds in a couple of minutes and whose pilots rated flying it as better than sex. How did Britain so lose the plot that today there is not a single aircraft manufacturer of any significance in the country? And what was it like to be alive in that marvellous post-war moment when innovative new British aircraft made their debut, and pilots were the rock stars of the age? James Hamilton-Paterson captures that season of glory in a compelling book that fuses his own memories of being a schoolboy plane spotter with a ruefully realistic history of British decline - its loss of self confidence and power. It is the story of great and charismatic machines and the men who flew them: heroes such as Bill Waterton, Neville Duke, John Derry and Bill Beaumont who took inconceivable risks, so that we could fly without a second thought.",,,05/01/11,"Books for a Men's Book Group

Examined Lives: From Socrates to Nietzsche,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Spirituality', '21st Century', 'Ancient']","A New York Times Notable Book for 2011We all want to know how to live. But before the good life was reduced to ten easy steps or a prescription from the doctor, philosophers offered arresting answers to the most fundamental questions about who we are and what makes for a life worth living.In Examined Lives, James Miller returns to this vibrant tradition with short, lively biographies of twelve famous philosophers. Socrates spent his life examining himself and the assumptions of others. His most famous student, Plato, risked his reputation to tutor a tyrant. Diogenes carried a bright lamp in broad daylight and announced he was ""looking for a man."" Aristotle's alliance with Alexander the Great presaged Seneca's complex role in the court of the Roman Emperor Nero. Augustine discovered God within himself. Montaigne and Descartes struggled to explore their deepest convictions in eras of murderous religious warfare. Rousseau aspired to a life of perfect virtue. Kant elaborated a new ideal of autonomy. Emerson successfully preached a gospel of self-reliance for the new American nation. And Nietzsche tried ""to compose into one and bring together what is fragment and riddle and dreadful chance in man,"" before he lapsed into catatonic madness.With a flair for paradox and rich anecdote, Examined Lives is a book that confirms the continuing relevance of philosophy today—and explores the most urgent questions about what it means to live a good life.",,,,January 4th 2011,[],ebook,,9781429957168,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1363862579l/10144239.jpg,3.77,[],49.0,1.0,,,,93.0,574.0,432,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","['122', '246', '166', '33', '7']",,[],,['James Miller']

"Enlightenment: Reason, Tolerance, and Humanity",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']","The Enlightenment stands at the threshold of the modern age. It elevated the natural sciences to the preeminent position they enjoy in modern culture. It inaugurated a skepticism toward tradition and authority that decisively shaped modern attitudes in religion, morality, and politics. And it gave birth to a vision of history that saw man, through the unfettered use of his own reason, at last escaping that state of “immaturity” to which superstition, prejudice, and dogma had condemned him. The world in which we live is, for better or worse, in large part the result of the Enlightenment. This course will explore this remarkable period. It will discuss the work of such influential thinkers as Voltaire, John Locke, Denis Diderot, Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, and Benjamin Franklin. It will also spend some time with less well-known, but no less influential, figures such as Joseph Priestly—a clergyman, scientist, and philosopher who was one of the most passionate defenders of the American Revolution in England—and the remarkable John Toland, a man whose writings on religion changed the way many Europeans thought about the Scriptures. The Enlightenment involved more than simply books and ideas. To understand the Enlightenment we need to look not just at what people wrote but also at how they lived. During the eighteenth century, they began to congregate in coffeehouses, where they read newspapers, discussed politics, and created something known as “public opinion.” Others of them began to meet in societies that were dedicated to the advancement of the sciences and there they explored how science might be put to work improving society. Still others began to meet in strange new secret societies—for example, the Masonic lodges that spread across Europe—where they attempted to put the ideals of equality and brotherhood into practice. From the start, the Enlightenment has been controversial. In its own day, some argued that it threatened to undermine the moral and religious foundations on which society rested. It has not ceased to be controversial. In our day, some have charged that many of the maladies of modern societies can be traced to its shallow rationalism. This course offers a more balanced assessment of the Enlightenment, considering both its achievements and its shortcomings and focusing not only on its most important intellectual achievements but also on the strange and often colorful characters who populated it. - From the Publisher",,,,2007,[],Audiobook,,9781419337154,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1269415182l/4691109.jpg,3.41,[],3.0,1.0,,,,87.0,46.0,8,"Prince Frederick, MD, [Boulder, Colo Recorded Books","['8', '12', '20', '3', '3']",,[],,['James Schmidt']

In it, Bloom, whose magnificent translation of Plato's Republic has been universally hailed as a virtual rediscovery of that timeless text, again brings together the translator's gift for journeying between two languages and cultures and the philosopher's perception of the true meaning and significance of the issues being examined in the work. The result is a clear, readable, and highly engrossing text that at the same time offers a wholly new sense of the importance and relevance of Rousseau's thought to us.In addition to his translation, Bloom provides a brilliant introduction that relates the structure and themes of the book to the vital preoccupation's of our own age, particularly in the field of education, but also more generally to the current concerns about the limits and possibilities of human nature. Thus in this translation Emile, long a classic in the history of Western thought and educational theory, becomes something more: a prescription, fresh and dazzling, for the bringing up of autonomous, responsible—that is, truly democratic—human beings.",,,10/30/62,June 29th 1979,[],Paperback,,9780465019311,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334836441l/326679.jpg,3.63,[],100.0,1.0,,,,85.0,3876.0,512,Basic Books,"['981', '1212', '1088', '439', '156']",,[],,"['Jean-Jacques Rousseau', 'Allan Bloom']"

Existentialism is a Humanism,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'Essays', 'French Literature', '20th Century', 'Theory', 'School', 'Nobel Prize']","It was to correct common misconceptions about his thought that Jean-Paul Sartre, the most dominent European intellectual of the post-World War II decades, accepted an invitation to speak on October 29, 1945, at the Club Maintenant in Paris. The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’s The Stranger, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal.

Escaping Destiny,,"['Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Young Adult', 'Amazon']","An ebony finger points skyward, emerging from the center of Node. Known simply as The Gate, it disappears into the clouds, massive spokes extending from the immense structure to stretch through the streets of the largest human city. No one knows who built the towering obelisk, but all are aware of those who have been entrusted as its caretakers. They call themselves The Maat. Otherworldly creatures, their humanoid forms move with an unholy speed and grace, their bodies little more than quicksilver fluid inside a malleable membrane. Pierce that membrane and they will die. Wielding a living crystalline blade, each warrior of The Maat is encased in patchwork leather armor, the suit carved piece by piece from their vanquished enemies. Once their membrane is shielded in the tanned flesh of their enemies, they become an unstoppable foe. The Maat have simply observed the beings of the world Tapestry, watching as threads of fate are woven into patterns only The Maat can comprehend. A prophecy that thirteen mortals will change all of the worlds connected through The Gate has begun to unfold. As the armies of darkness and light struggle to claim the mortals as their own, The Maat begin to interfere with human affairs. One by one, the thirteen mortals are swayed or captured. The lines between good and evil are blurred in the name of power and righteousness. Kai Oakman is one of the thirteen mortals that is spoken of in the prophecy.

He too gathers those spoken of in prophesy to his side, seeking to thwart fate and live their own lives freely in whatever manner they choose.

En cien años todos muertos: Guía para emprender o morir... sin haberlo hecho,,['Business'],"Este libro es sólo para emprendedores. El resto no lo va a entender. No me refiero técnicamente, sino en espíritu. Si eres feliz con tu trabajo, tu sueldo y tu vida, y sólo quieres cumplir un horario de 9:00 a 17:00 h, deja de leer. No es para ti.  Pero si tu trabajo no te realiza, no te hace feliz (o incluso te disgusta) y estás considerando montar tu propio negocio, pero no te atreves, tienes miedo o no sabes cómo, sigue leyendo. Y si conoces a alguien que esté en esa situación, dile que le eche un vistazo también. Le puede ser de mucha ayuda.  Aunque por el título no lo pueda parecer, este libro es una guía de supervivencia para emprendedores.  Vamos a ver todas aquellas cosas que me hubiera gustado que me contaran antes de empezar a emprender. Todo lo que considero imprescindible. Todo lo que cualquier emprendedor debería saber para emprender sin morir en el intento.  Veréis que hay dos tipos de capítulos. Unos son más técnicos: hablo de conceptos, técnicas y estrategias de negocio y de marketing. Otros son más humanos: hablo de relaciones, miedos y sentimientos.  Muchos expertos me han recomendado centrarme sólo en uno de esos dos ejes, y enfocarlo sólo a nivel profesional o sólo a nivel humano. ¿Pero sabéis qué? ¡Este NO es un libro de gestión empresarial! ¡Ni un libro de psicología! Es un libro para emprendedores. ¡Una guía de supervivencia!  No puedo hablar de cómo emprender sin hablar del miedo al fracaso. No puedo hablar de crear un negocio sin hablar de la conciliación familiar. En definitiva, no puedo hablar de cómo ser emprendedor sin hablar de cómo ser persona.  Así pues, en contra de todo consejo, os voy a guiar a través de la interesante aventura de emprender. Y veremos de todo. Una aproximación holística a la figura del emprendedor.  Mi objetivo es mencionar y explicar de una forma llana y simple todos aquellos puntos que debéis tener en cuenta. Advertiros. Avisaros. Haceros descubrir. Pero ojo, porque cada uno de esos puntos podría ser un libro entero. Y de hecho, los hay. Montones de ellos. ¡Y algunos estupendos!  Pero mi intención no es entrar exhaustivamente en cada uno de esos temas, ya que eso nos haría perder el hilo conductor, la visión global.

Every Dead Thing,,"['Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Detective', 'Paranormal', 'Supernatural']","Tortured and brilliant private detective Charlie Parker stars in this thriller by New York Times bestselling author John Connolly.Former NYPD detective Charlie ""Bird"" Parker is on the verge of madness. Tortured by the unsolved slayings of his wife and young daughter, he is a man consumed by guilt, regret, and the desire for revenge. When his former partner asks him to track down a missing girl, Parker finds himself drawn into a world beyond his imagining: a world where thirty-year-old killings remain shrouded in fear and lies, a world where the ghosts of the dead torment the living, a world haunted by the murderer responsible for the deaths in his family—a serial killer who uses the human body to create works of art and takes faces as his prize. But the search awakens buried instincts in Parker: instincts for survival, for compassion, for love, and, ultimately, for killing.Aided by a beautiful young psychologist and a pair of bickering career criminals, Parker becomes the bait in a trap set in the humid bayous of Louisiana, a trap that threatens the lives of everyone in its reach. Driven by visions of the dead and the voice of an old black psychic who met a terrible end, Parker must seek a final, brutal confrontation with a murderer who has moved beyond all notions of humanity, who has set out to create a hell on earth: the serial killer known only as the Traveling Man.In the tradition of classic American detective fiction, Every Dead Thing is a tense, richly plotted thriller, filled with memorable characters and gripping action. It is also a profoundly moving novel, concerned with the nature of loyalty, love, and forgiveness. Lyrical and terrifying, it is an ambitious debut, triumphantly realized.",Charlie Parker #1,,05/11/99,July 1st 2000,['Charlie Parker'],Paperback,,9780671027315,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393929687l/175242.jpg,3.98,"['Barry Award Nominee for Best British Crime Novel (2000)', 'Shamus Award for Best First PI Novel (2000)']",979.0,13.0,,,,92.0,25694.0,467,Pocket Books,"['9270', '9376', '4979', '1373', '696']",,[],,['John Connolly']

Evolution and the Theory of Games,,Science,"In this 1982 book, the theory of games, first developed to analyse economic behaviour, is modified so that it can be applied to evolving populations. John Maynard Smith's concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy is relevant whenever the best thing for an animal or plant to do depends on what others are doing. The theory leads to testable predictions about the evolution of behaviour, of sex and genetic systems, and of growth and life history patterns. This book contains a full account of the theory, and of the data relevant to it. The account is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, teachers and research workers in animal behaviour, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The book will also be of interest to mathematicians and game theorists; the mathematics has been largely confined to appendixes so that the main text may be easily followed by biologists.",,,,1982.0,,,0521288843,9780521288842,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nag2IhmPS3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.0,,,,,,,,,234.0,,,80.0,,,['John Maynard Smith']

East of Eden,,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'Adult']","In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flap",,Steinbeck Centennial Edition (US / CAN),10/28/52,10/28/02,"['Mr. Edwards', 'Ethel', 'Lee', 'Faye', 'Tom Hamilton', 'Cyrus Trask', 'Mrs. Trask', 'Alice Trask', 'Adam Trask', 'Charles Trask', 'Aron Trask', 'Caleb Trask', 'Samuel Hamilton', 'Liza Hamilton', 'George Hamilton', 'Will Hamilton', 'Joe Hamilton', 'Lizzie Hamilton', 'Una Hamilton', 'Dessie Hamilton', 'Olive Hamilton', 'Mollie Hamilton', 'Cathy Ames', 'Abra Bacon', 'Joe Valery']",Paperback,,9780142000656,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544744853l/4406.jpg,4.38,"['Audie Award for Classic (2004)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Fiction (1953)']",28764.0,344.0,,,,96.0,428907.0,601,Penguin Books,"['246230', '119358', '46605', '11428', '5286']",,['California (United States)'],,['John Steinbeck']

Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.The characters are unique and inventive—bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human.

His friends look on, but they're dead, too, their bodies found in squats and sheds and alleyways across the city. Victims of heroin, they're ghosts in the shadows, a chorus keeping vigil as the hours pass, paying their own particular homage as their friend's body is taken away, examined, investigated, and cremated.All their stories are laid out piece by broken piece through a series of fractured narratives. We meet Robert, the deceased, the only alcoholic in a sprawling group of junkies; Danny, just back from uncomfortable holidays with family, who discovers the body; Laura, Robert's daughter, who stumbles into the drug addict's life when she moves in with her father after years apart; Heather, who has her own home for the first time since she was a teenager; Mike, the Falklands War vet; and all the others. Theirs are stories of lives fallen through the cracks, hopes flaring and dying, love overwhelmed by more immediate needs. These invisible people live in a parallel reality to most of us, out of reach of food and shelter. And in their sudden deaths, it becomes clear, they are treated with more respect than they ever were in their short lives.Intense, exhilarating, and shot through with hope and fury, Even the Dogs is an intimate exploration of life at the edges of society—a deeply humane book littered with love, loss, despair, and a half glimpse of redemption—now reissued with a new introduction by Yiyun Li.",,,02/01/10,May 12th 2020,"['Ben', 'Danny', 'Heather', 'Steve Logan', 'Robert John Radcliffe', 'Laura Radcliffe', 'Mike Crossley', 'Ant']",Paperback,,9781948226721,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572012506l/48577242._SY475_.jpg,3.48,['International Dublin Literary Award (2012)'],97.0,1.0,,,,81.0,1909.0,256,Catapult,"['392', '612', '543', '253', '109']",,['England'],,"['Jon McGregor', 'Yiyun Lee']"

A steady, well-paying job; a rent-free Manhattan apartment; and Hope, his stunning, blue-blooded fiancée: smart, sexy, and completely out of his league. But as the wedding day looms, Zack finds himself haunted by the memory of his best friend, Rael, killed in a car wreck two years earlier, and by his increasingly complicated feelings for Tamara, the beautiful widow Rael left behind. Then Norm--Zack’s freewheeling, Viagra-popping father--resurfaces after a twenty-year absence, looking to make amends. Norm’s overbearing, often outrageous efforts to reestablish ties with his sons infuriate Zack, and yet, despite twenty years of bad blood, he finds something compelling in his father’s maniacal determination to transform his own life. Inspired by Norm, Zack boldly attempts to make some changes of his own, and the results are instantly calamitous. Soon fists are flying, his love life is a shambles, and his once carefully structured existence is spinning hopelessly out of control.

Essence,,[],"After years of negotiations, the vampires and humans finally came to an agreement on how they could co-exist. There was only peace for a short time as the vampire race began to run low on their agreed upon food supply and started feeding on those who were considered off limits.	With many of their own disappearing, the human leaders tasked Stanley Falcon to develop a special substance that once injected into the bloodstream of the humans, made them tainted in the eyes of the vampires. The human leaders saw this as an opportunity to profit and priced the shot astronomically high. 	Their efforts to starve the vampire nation created absolute chaos all across the globe. This brought Armand Vallini, the head of the vampire nation, to gather his forces and survive by any means necessary. 	The unlikeliest of heroes to be called to arms was Chase Falcon, the son of Stanley Falcon, who had a personal score to settle with Armand Vallini.

Wed by proxy, he refused to be charmed by his new bride's blond curls and effervescent laughter, or impressed by her trappings of wealth...even if his son and daughter believed she was a fairy princess come to life. He was furious -- and ready to send her packing, until a near tragedy convinced him that her beauty was more than skin-deep. But even after he had yielded to the wild desire that surged between them, Josh could not admit how much he truly needed her. Then an old scandal threatened to re-emerge, and he realized that he could lose her forever....",Montgomery/Taggert (Publication order) #17,,,February 1st 1992,"['Joshua Templeton', 'Carrie Montgomery', 'Joshua Greene']",Paperback,,9780671744571,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1304272321l/251962.jpg,3.88,[],85.0,1.0,,,,93.0,4471.0,310,Pocket Books,"['1387', '1513', '1251', '275', '45']",,['United States of America'],,['Jude Deveraux']

With millions of devoted fans and ten New York Times bestsellers to date, McNaught is a writer whose work just gets better with each new novel-and Every Breath You Take is the book readers have been waiting for. Returning to the lavish Chicago setting of her popular novel Paradise, and revisiting some of that book's characters as well, this story will captivate in inimitable Judith McNaught style.High atop a snow-covered hill, the stately old Wyatt mansion is perched like a crown, its stone spires pointing upward, its stained glass windows glowing like colorful jewels. Such opulence means success and, surely, happiness. But on the eve of wealthy philanthropist Cecil Wyatt's eightieth birthday, all the money in the world won't bring back his missing grandson, William Wyatt. The only thing for certain: Foul play was involved.The family, the police, the media-all have tried in vain to discover the young man's fate. Now suspicion has turned shockingly toward William's own half-brother, the rather distant and enigmatic Mitchell Wyatt.Kate Donovan never dreamed that a chance romantic encounter on a tropical island paradise would tag her as a suspect in a high-society murder case. But after Kate tangles with the darkly charismatic Mitchell Wyatt, she finds herself cast in a shadow of guilt and mistrust. As the Chicago police tighten their net, it will take all of Kate's ingenuity to clear her name.

Einstein: A Biography,,"['Biography', 'Science', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'German Literature']","Albert Einstein is an icon of the twentieth century. Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, he is most famous for his theory of relativity. He also made enormous contributions to quantum mechanics and cosmology, and for his work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. A self-pronounced pacifist, humanist, and, late in his life, democratic socialist, Einstein was also deeply concerned with the social impact of his discoveries. Much of Einstein's life is shrouded in legend. From popular images and advertisements to various works of theater and fiction, he has come to signify so many things. In Einstein: A Biography, Jürgen Neffe presents a clear and probing portrait of the man behind the myth. Unearthing new documents, including a series of previously unknown letters from Einstein to his sons, which shed new light on his role as a father, Neffe paints a rich portrait of the tumultuous years in which Einstein lived and worked. And with a background in the sciences, he describes and contextualizes Einstein's enormous contributions to our scientific legacy. Einstein, a breakout bestseller in Germany, is sure to be a classic biography of the man and proverbial genius who has been called ""the brain of the [twentieth] century.""",,,10/30/05,April 17th 2007,['Albert Einstein'],Hardcover,,9780374146641,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312017611l/780687.jpg,4.03,[],98.0,1.0,,,,95.0,269.0,480,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","['96', '100', '59', '14', '0']",,[],,"['Jürgen Neffe', 'Shelley Frisch']"

  Edge of Eternity is the sweeping, passionate conclusion to Ken Follett’s extraordinary historical epic, The Century Trilogy.
 Throughout these books, Follett has followed the fortunes of five intertwined families – American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh – as they make their way through the twentieth century. Now they come to one of the most tumultuous eras of all: the enormous social, political, and economic turmoil of the 1960s through the 1980s, from civil rights, assassinations, mass political movements and Vietnam to the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, presidential impeachment, revolution – and rock and roll.East German teacher Rebecca Hoffman discovers she’s been spied on by the Stasi for years and commits an impulsive act that will affect her family for the rest of their lives.…George Jakes, the child of a mixed-race couple, bypasses a corporate law career to join Robert F. Kennedy’s Justice Department, and finds himself in the middle not only of the seminal events of the civil rights battle, but a much more personal battle of his own.…Cameron Dewar, the grandson of a senator, jumps at the chance to do some official and unofficial espionage for a cause he believes in, only to discover that the world is a much more dangerous place than he’d imagined.…Dimka Dvorkin, a young aide to Nikita Khrushchev, becomes a prime agent both for good and for ill as the United States and the Soviet Union race to the brink of nuclear war, while his twin sister, Tania, carves out a role that will take her from Moscow to Cuba to Prague to Warsaw – and into history.As always with Follett, the historical background is brilliantly researched and rendered, the action fast-moving, the characters rich in nuance and emotion.

The only group preserving the fragile harmony is the Order, an elite cadre of Breed warriors dedicated to protecting humans and vampires alike. And in this precarious world of torn loyalties and shattered trust, Mira, a fiery squad captain, finds that every fight bears an intensely personal cost.    Raised among the Order, Mira has always believed in the warrior’s code of swift—and even lethal—justice.

In love with him since childhood, Mira once broke through his tough exterior during an unexpected night of rapture, but the next day he mysteriously disappeared, never to return.   Kellan didn’t think he would ever see Mira again—or have to confront the truth of why he left.

End of History,,[],"With the onset of the twenty-first century, the impulse of our times is to escape from the implications of history, and replace it with whatever is fashionable or politically correct. The standars that have upheld Western Civilization have give way to relativism. Current historiography is being trivialized and politicized. Revisonist historians are rewriting history to suit the purposes of various pressure groups. This in effect makes history meaningless. If history has no meaning, then it is proper for history to be revised according to the current politically correct point of view. Yet, if history has meaning, it must be confronted, for the meaning of history conclusively affects our lives. This essay looks at this question, not only throught the eyes of the historian, but also with references to the philosophical and theological implications of this problem. This work examines these issues and the ultimate meaning of history. It looks at how history has effected our culture, our civilization, and our lives. It's thesis delves into the different definitions of history, the role of the historian, and various philosophies of history. The role of Providence in history is also examined, as well as the final purpose and goal of history. This focus on the meaning of history in our civilization is necessary as we face the threats of the new millennium, if our society and culture are to survive and thrive, rather than decline and decay.",,,10/30/01,December 1st 2001,['St. Augustine to Freud'],Paperback,,9780595204830,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348254525l/3090523.jpg,4.33,[],99.0,1.0,,,,100.0,3.0,120,iUniverse,[],,['Croton On Hudson (United States)'],,['Larry Conde']
Everyday Sexism,,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Politics', 'Gender', 'Womens', 'Adult', 'Sociology', 'Gender Studies', 'Audiobook', 'Social Justice']","Women are standing up and #shoutingback. In a culture that's driven by social media, for the first time women are using this online space (@EverydaySexism www.everydaysexism.com) to come together, share their stories and encourage a new generation to recognise the problems that women face. This book is a call to arms in a new wave of feminism and it proves sexism is endemic - socially, politically and economically. But women won't stand for it. The Everyday Sexism Project is grounded in reality; packed with substance, validity and integrity it shows that women will no longer tolerate a society that ignores the dangers and endless effects of sexism.  In 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport Laura Bates, a young journalist, started a project called Everyday Sexism to collect stories for a piece she was writing on the issue. Astounded by the response she received and the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, she quickly realised that the situation was far worse than she'd initially thought. Enough was enough. From being leered at and wolf-whistled on the street, to aggravation in the work place and serious sexual assault, it was clear that sexism had been normalised. Bates decided it was time for change.  This bold, jaunty and ultimately intelligent book is the first to give a collective online voice to the protest against sexism. This game changing book is a juggernaut of stories, often shocking, sometimes amusing and always poignant - it is a must read for every inquisitive, no-nonsense modern woman.",,,04/10/14,May 1st 2014,[],Hardcover,,9781471131578,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394425595l/21251323.jpg,4.25,['Waterstones Book of the Year Nominee (2014)'],182.0,2.0,,,,94.0,8482.0,384,Simon & Schuster,"['4279', '2766', '941', '294', '202']",,[],,['Laura Bates']

El libro de la alquimista,,"['Paranormal', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Erotic Romance', 'Mythology', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Adult']","Dos mil años sin sentir nada son demasiados, incluso para un inmortal como Cahal McCloud. En el pasado, los dioses Vanir lo castigaron por violar las leyes y lo relegaron a una eternidad sin emociones, convirtiéndolo en un crisol vacío, hasta que encontrara a su pareja de vida y esta le devolviese todo lo perdido. Pero nunca imaginó que su cáraid estaría de parte de Loki y sus jotuns, que lo secuestraría y lo torturaría durante interminables y agónicos días. Ahora, por fin, las tornas se han cambiado, y es la científica quién está a su merced. Su sangre le dará un enorme poder, el druida en él despertará y su secreto don será requerido en la lucha contra Lucius y Newscientists, pero nada le importará más al vanirio que vengarse de su verruga. Aunque su alma esté eternamente atada a la de él, aunque los destruya a los dos, llevará a cabo su cometido hasta las últimas consecuencias. Él no se pudo proteger de ella, ahora nadie la podrá proteger de él.La científica no entiende lo mucho que a cambiado su visión de la realidad en tan poco tiempo. Ella creyó que trabajan para los buenos, pensó que sus conocimientos se hacían servir para erradicar el mal. Pero estaba equivocada. La engañaron vilmente. Aquellos que creía que eran sus amigos, son sus enemigos; y ahora ese rubio tan hermoso a quien ella había maltratado, que afirma no ser un vampiro, la ha secuestrada, y la quiere forzar a entrar en su mundo nocturno de un modo cruel y autoritario, obligándola a aceptar cosas de ella misma que ni siquiera sabía y forzándola a revelar una información que sólo ella sabe. La joven luchará por mantener vida su esencia, por salvaguardar el descubrimiento que Lucius y Newscientists anhelan saber, y peleará sobre todo por mantener en pie las murallas que resguardan a su corazón. Aunque el vanirio las dinamite.Todavía no se han recuperado todos los tótems, la profecía del noaiti encaja sus piezas, Heimdal ha desaparecido y es urgente dar con él, Lucios ambiciona el conocimiento de su ex científica y vanirios y berserkers harán de tripas corazón para proteger a la fría mujer del druida del clan keltoi.",Saga Vanir #6,,01/01/12,November 3rd 2012,[],Paperback,,9788493933890,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347915528l/16032012.jpg,4.18,[],95.0,1.0,,,,94.0,1340.0,512,Editorial Vanir,"['640', '403', '217', '55', '25']",,[],,['Lena Valenti']

Es el ojo derecho de As Landin, el mejor amigo del noaiti, y un hombre muy importante en el clan berserker de Wolverhampton. Le dijeron que era hijo de una pareja de guerreros, y que recién nacido fue a parar a manos de As. Ahora ha descubierto que todo es mentira,y que lo único auténtico y real en su vida es la pasión demoledora que siente hacia Nanna, la valkyria intocable de Freyja. Sin embargo aquello que más desea le es negado por normas divinas, y Noah se esta volviendo loco por la desesperación. Si a eso se le añade las extrañas pesadillas que tiene desde que fue herido por el puñal Guddine, su vida es de todo menos apacible. No obstante, las runas hablan con objetividad, y les da igual si ellos son o no son compatibles. Después de sobrevivir milagrosamente en la batalla de Machre Moor, Noah deberá realizar un viaje para descubrir quién es y qué ha venido hacer en el Mirdgard, y es una cuestión innegociable que su pareja en su aventura, sea Nanna. ¿Cómo podrá soportar estar cerca de ella y no tocarla?Nanna siempre fue la niña de los ojos de Freyja. Era la elegida por los dioses para recoger a los muertos en batalla en el Midgard y tiene una gran peculiaridad: ningún hombre vivo la puede tocar. No obstante, el berserker de ojos amarillos ha roto su palabra y ha violado su norma, provocando que la ira de Freyja cayera sobre ella. Nanna no quiere saber nada de él, pero la Diosa Vanir tiene otros planes para ella, que deberá obedecer si quiere que la perdone de nuevo. Empezará un viaje único y revelador, lleno de aventuras, guerra y magia, al lado del único hombre que ha deseado en su vida, del que dicen que es importante para el destino del Ragnarök.

Él es un einherjar, un guerrero de Odín que sufrió una grandísima traición a manos de la mujer que estaba destinada a ser su compañera eterna. La valkyria le pisoteó el corazón y, debido a ella, lo enviaron a la Tierra a proteger a los humanos; solo, con el alma destrozada y un odio latente en su interior. Carece de sentimientos, carece de miedo y su espíritu rezuma despecho y ansia por devolver el dolor sufrido. Ahora, tiene la posibilidad de obtener aquello que más anhela: someter a Bryn y hacerle pagar por partirle el corazón. Sin embargo, mientras se ciega en su furia, no solo podría perder de vista la misión de encontrar a Gungnir, la lanza de Odín; también podría perder el respeto de aquellos que le rodean y la oportunidad de recibir una explicación por parte de la Generala que podría cambiarlo todo. Pero, ¿cómo puede escuchar un hombre al que nada le ofende impunemente? Bryn La Salvaje lleva eones flagelándose por la decisión que tomó y que afectó de lleno a Ardan. Sus palabras lo alejaron de ella, rompieron su kompromiss y congelaron las alas de su einherjar, el hombre por el que hubiera dado su vida a ciegas. Las alas de ambos están heladas y azules. Pero ahora, ella y su ejército de valkyrias se encuentran en Escocia luchando por recuperar el último de los totems divinos de los dioses que fueron robados del Asgard. La Generala estará, contra su voluntad, en manos del duro highlander, pero no rendirá hasta demostrarle al escocés déspota y dominante que puede someter su cuerpo, pero nunca su alma ni su corazón. Una palabra de Ardan la devolvería al Valhall sin honores; y una pregunta del guerrero de ojos caramelo podría cambiar la relación entre ellos. ¿Le importará ella lo suficiente como para preguntarle por qué hizo lo que hizo? ¿Aprenderá Ardan que no se puede someter a alguien tan disciplinado y honorable como Bryn? El Midgard empieza temblar. La tierra se agrieta y de sus entrañas nace una terrible rebelión. Los portales se empiezan a activar uno detrás de otro y Gungnir, todavía extraviada, no debe clavarse en ninguno de ellos. La guerra está a la vuelta de la esquina. Pero no hay batalla más sangrienta que la que estalla entre dos guerreros de alas congeladas. El hielo seco de ella puede quemar tanto como el despachado fuego de él.

Eredità: Una storia della mia famiglia tra l'Impero e il fascismo,,"['History', 'Biography', 'Italian Literature']","È il novembre del 1918, e il mondo di Rosa Tiefenthaler è andato in frantumi. L’Impero austroungarico in cui è nata e vissuta non esiste più: con poche righe su un Trattato di pace la sua terra, il Sudtirolo, è passata all’Italia. “Il nostro cuore e la nostra mente rimarranno tedeschi in eterno”, scrive Rosa sul suo diario. Colta e libera per il suo tempo, lo tiene da quasi vent’anni, dal giorno del suo matrimonio con l’amato Jakob. Mai avrebbe pensato di riversare nelle sue pagine una così brutale lacerazione. Ne seguiranno molte altre. In pochi anni l’avvento del fascismo cambia il suo destino. Cominciano le persecuzioni per lei e per la sua famiglia, colpevoli di voler difendere la loro lingua e la loro identità: saranno arrestati, incarcerati, mandati al confino. E Rosa assiste impotente al naufragio di tutte le sue certezze. Intorno a lei, troppi si lasciano sedurre da un sogno pericoloso che si sta affacciando sulla scena europea: quello della Germania nazista. Non potrà impedire che Hella, la figlia minore, sia presa nel vortice dell’ideologia fatale di Hitler. E presto dovrà affrontare la scelta impossibile tra l’oppressione e l’esilio. Nata austriaca, vissuta sotto l’Italia, morta all’ombra del Reich, Rosa è il simbolo dei tormenti di una terra di confine.

Every Patient Tells a Story: Medical Mysteries and the Art of Diagnosis,,"['Nonfiction', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Science', 'Health', 'Memoir', 'Health Care', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'Psychology']","A riveting exploration of the most difficult and important part of what doctors do, by Yale School of Medicine physician Dr. Lisa Sanders, author of the monthly New York Times Magazine column ""Diagnosis,"" the inspiration for the hit Fox TV series House, M.D.The experience of being ill can be like waking up in a foreign country. Life, as you formerly knew it, is on hold while you travel through this other world as unknown as it is unexpected. When I see patients in the hospital or in my office who are suddenly, surprisingly ill, what they really want to know is, ‘What is wrong with me?’ They want a road map that will help them manage their new surroundings. The ability to give this unnerving and unfamiliar place a name, to know it–on some level–restores a measure of control, independent of whether or not that diagnosis comes attached to a cure. Because, even today, a diagnosis is frequently all a good doctor has to offer.A healthy young man suddenly loses his memory–making him unable to remember the events of each passing hour. Two patients diagnosed with Lyme disease improve after antibiotic treatment–only to have their symptoms mysteriously return. A young woman lies dying in the ICU–bleeding, jaundiced, incoherent–and none of her doctors know what is killing her. In Every Patient Tells a Story, Dr. Lisa Sanders takes us bedside to witness the process of solving these and other diagnostic dilemmas, providing a firsthand account of the expertise and intuition that lead a doctor to make the right diagnosis.Never in human history have doctors had the knowledge, the tools, and the skills that they have today to diagnose illness and disease. And yet mistakes are made, diagnoses missed, symptoms or tests misunderstood. In this high-tech world of modern medicine, Sanders shows us that knowledge, while essential, is not sufficient to unravel the complexities of illness. She presents an unflinching look inside the detective story that marks nearly every illness–the diagnosis–revealing the combination of uncertainty and intrigue that doctors face when confronting patients who are sick or dying. Through dramatic stories of patients with baffling symptoms, Sanders portrays the absolute necessity and surprising difficulties of getting the patient’s story, the challenges of the physical exam, the pitfalls of doctor-to-doctor communication, the vagaries of tests, and the near calamity of diagnostic errors. In Every Patient Tells a Story, Dr. Sanders chronicles the real-life drama of doctors solving these difficult medical mysteries that not only illustrate the art and science of diagnosis, but often save the patients’ lives.",,,11/06/09,July 31st 2009,[],Kindle Edition,,B002JRQM72,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1514369759l/6691125._SY475_.jpg,3.95,[],88.0,1.0,,,,95.0,6478.0,304,Harmony,"['1981', '2628', '1519', '286', '64']",,[],,['Lisa Sanders']

Essie's Kids and the Rolling Calf: Island Style Story,,[],"A ""rolling calf"" is a ghost that often appears in the form of an animal. Most people who had close encounters reported that they first heard or detected the rolling calves by their loud chiming and rather unnerving clanking noise. This familiar sound was made by the long chain that they dragged along behind them. They have large red eyes like a dragon's. Some even said that they could breathe fire through their mouths. Some said that the rolling calves were the spirits of evil butchers who had been cruel and mean when they were alive. The best way, they said, to get away from these monstrous beasts was to drop various things on the ground. This storybook was written in an exciting island-style manner. It is about Essie's kids on the island of Jamaica and their unusual encounter with a rolling calf. This is the first of a five part series. The story is continuous. The whole series should be read in order to truly see and understand the full picture that the authors are trying to illustrate. Along with the ability of this black and white picture-book to be used as a coloring-book, there is also a drawing/note pad at the end of each book that allows the reader to draw or demonstrate their own personal illustration of the story after completing the book. Finally, these books also end uniquely always with a strong moral story. 'When it dawned on Karl that his pursuer was most likely to be a rolling calf, he really started running as if he hadn't been running before. He forgot about his damaged toe. He forgot about running and hopping. He was now running full, top speed, Carl Lewis or Asafa Powell style. He was all-out straight sprinting. He shifted into sixth gear and took off blazing the trail for his dear life. Neither Usain Bolt nor Michael Johnson nor any other athlete or track and field star could have kept up with Karl that night. He was sure that he must have broken some kind of world record. He was seriously on the verge of flying as he could feel the wind rushing by him like a turbulent storm.' Chapter 5, page 26 of Essie's Kids and the Rolling Calf.

In Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, she says that what actually molds every moment of every day of one's life are feelings. Using a candid, witty approach to a genre riddled with self-important puffery, she shows how feelings - not positive thinking, or sweat and strain, or good or bad luck, or even smarts - set the tone for people's lives.

Using examples from literature, history, neighborhood signage, and her own imagination, Truss shows how meaning is shaped by commas and apostrophes, and the hilarious consequences of punctuation gone awry.Featuring a foreword by Frank McCourt, and interspersed with a lively history of punctuation from the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, Eats, Shoots & Leaves makes a powerful case for the preservation of proper punctuation.",,,01/02/03,April 2006,[],Paperback,,9781592402038,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473392595l/8600._SX318_.jpg,3.87,[],3202.0,53.0,,,,92.0,97133.0,209,The Penguin Group,"['28620', '36864', '24012', '5758', '1879']",,[],,['Lynne Truss']

E niente: La mia vita con Andonio che non saluta mai!,,[],"Oggi Marco è «il re indiscusso delle webstar italiane», secondo Le Iene, che gli hanno dedicato un lungo servizio, uno youtuber con milioni di visualizzazioni, che fa il tutto esaurito nei locali, è stato ospite delle principali trasmissioni tv ed è comparso al fianco di molte celebrities, come Paolo Ruffini, Barbara d'Urso, Gianni Morandi. I suoi tormentoni, da Saluta Andonio a Buonaseeera, vengono stampati su magliette e cover di cellulari. Ma prima del giorno in cui ha postato il video che l'ha reso celebre, la sua vita era semplicemente quella di un tredicenne di provincia, «vai all'Iper a fare un giro con gli amici, un panino al McDonald's, ti compri l'album della Champions... e niente». Un ragazzino che voleva divertirsi − e gli piace ancora − uno come tanti, insomma. Solamente con qualche chilo in più. E che per questo, ogni tanto, era costretto a chiudersi in casa e aspettare che l'occhio nero si sgonfiasse. È per sfidare i bulli che Marco inizia a fare video. Anche quel video: lui in macchina con il padre, che proprio non vuole saperne di salutare. «Saluta Andonio», ma Antonio non saluta. Non saluta mai. Nel giro di poche ore, il video impazza, diventa virale e la vita di Marco cambia. Tutti ora vogliono fare selfie con lui, anche i ragazzi e le ragazze che lo prendevano in giro, che lo bullizzavano, e adesso fanno a gara per stargli vicino.

In the years between the two world wars, the future held more promise than peril, but there was evidence of things unseen that would transfigure our unquestioned trust in a safe future. Fos has returned to Tennessee from the trenches of France. Intrigued with electricity, bioluminescence, and especially x-rays, he believes in science and the future of technology. On a trip to the Outer Banks to study the Perseid meteor shower, he falls in love with Opal, whose father is a glassblower who can spin color out of light.Fos brings his new wife back to Knoxville where he runs a photography studio with his former Army buddy Flash. A witty rogue and a staunch disbeliever in Prohibition, Flash brings tragedy to the couple when his appetite for pleasure runs up against both the law and the Ku Klux Klan. Fos and Opal are forced to move to Opal's mother's farm on the Clinch River, and soon they have a son, Lightfoot. But when the New Deal claims their farm for the TVA, Fos seeks work at the Oak Ridge Laboratory -- Site X in the government's race to build the bomb. And it is there, when Opal falls ill with radiation poisoning, that Fos's great faith in science deserts him. Their lives have traveled with touching inevitability from their innocence and fascination with ""things that glow"" to the new world of manmade suns.

What fleeting memories disturbed her sleep were fragments of terror - a strange silver man and a screaming woman with hair that circled her head like a ring of fire. Since leaving Darkover as a child, Margaret had lived her life on Thetis. Lew and her stepmother, Diotima, were gone much of the year, working in the Senate, struggling to keep Darkover safe from the all-consuming imperialism of the Terran Federation. She hardly knew her father, a brooding man who, when he returned to Thetis, was prone to long bouts of drinking. At these times, his normally morose and uncommunicative demeanor would take on an even darker hue ... times when he seemed to look at Margaret and see someone else - someone he did not want to remember. As soon as Margaret was of age, she fled her stormy home and took refuge on University. Here Margaret, strangely uncomfortable around her peers, found solace in the isolation of study. She excelled in music and was granted the position of assistant to her mentor, renowned musicologist Dr. Ivor Davidson. This prestigious job took her to many worlds, and when she and Professor Davidson were assigned to collect folk songs on Darkover, Margaret was curious and pleased. But once on Darkover, Margaret's innocent excitement quickly waned. The world of her birth evoked long-buried memories, painful and terrifying, and she soon found herself falling deeper and deeper into a waking dream that threatened to become a nightmare.

El origen musical de los animales-símbolos en la mitología y la escultura antiguas,,[],"En el principio era el sonido, era el ritmo; la sustancia sonora es la materia prima del mundo: éste es el fundamento de El origen musical de los animales-símbolos del profesor Marius Schneider. Etnología, musicología y simbología se conjugan en esta obra que fue definida por Elémire Zolla como «la única completamente iniciática del siglo  XX». Escrita en lengua castellana durante la estancia del profesor Schneider en Barcelona, fue publicada en 1946. Las culturas primitivas, con las que Schneider estuvo en contacto directo en África, y las denominadas altas culturas constituyen el ámbito que permite la reconstrucción de todo un sistema de correspondencias místicas entre los sonidos, los astros, los instrumentos musicales o los cuatro elementos. El autor parte de la cosmografía musical megalítica, conservada en la Europa medieval o en los textos védicos de la India, para descifrar las claves musicales inscritas en los capiteles de los claustros del monasterio de San Cugat y de la catedral de Gerona. Pero El origen musical de los animales-símbolos es, además, una auténtica iniciación en la simbología pues introduce al lector en las nociones básicas de correspondencia, analogía y ritmo común.

An American Iliad, this richly detailed and meticulously researched historical novel continues the story she began in Doc, following Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday to Tombstone, Arizona, and to the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.A deeply divided nation. Vicious politics. A shamelessly partisan media. A president loathed by half the populace. Smuggling and gang warfare along the Mexican border. Armed citizens willing to stand their ground and take law into their own hands. . . . That was America in 1881.All those forces came to bear on the afternoon of October 26 when Doc Holliday and the Earp brothers faced off against the Clantons and the McLaurys in Tombstone, Arizona. It should have been a simple misdemeanor arrest. Thirty seconds and thirty bullets later, three officers were wounded and three citizens lay dead in the dirt.Wyatt Earp was the last man standing, the only one unscathed. The lies began before the smoke cleared, but the gunfight at the O.K. Corral would soon become central to American beliefs about the Old West.Epitaph tells Wyatt’s real story, unearthing the Homeric tragedy buried under 130 years of mythology, misrepresentation, and sheer indifference to fact. Epic and intimate, this novel gives voice to the real men and women whose lives were changed forever by those fatal thirty seconds in Tombstone.

Triunfaba en su profesión, su cuenta bancaria crecía día a día y una de las más bellas mujeres del mundo lo acompañaba a donde él quisiese. Sin embargo, en el instante en que la vio supo que era un hombre incompleto y que su vida era completamente ficticia. Lara Galantes era una mujer prohibida e inalcanzable para él. Consciente de ello, ella se convierte en su secreto mejor guardado; en la obsesión que gobierna sus días; en la certeza de que tiene que arrancársela de la cabeza o su mundo perfecto se desmoronará. Cuando sus caminos finalmente se cruzan, sus propios sentimientos los sorprenden a ambos. La pasión los arrastra el uno al otro, completándolos, inundando sus corazones de una felicidad desconocida. Pero el pasado, del que ninguno quiere hablar, se cierne sobre ellos; los celos, la desconfianza y los secretos generan una brecha que termina enfrentándolos a sus propias miserias, amenazando con separarlos.",,,,April 8th 2013,[],ebook,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368487451l/17915750.jpg,3.62,[],75.0,1.0,,,,83.0,53.0,812,Autopublicación,"['15', '14', '15', '7', '2']",,[],,['María Laura Gamberro']
El sueño creador,,[],"El tiempo se transforma en argumento de la libertad. No es la permanente vigilancia que lleva a cabo la racionalidad moderna de su propio ensimismamiento de leyes y órdenes, ejes de coordenadas y poleas; sino el camino que fluye en la conciencia de la vida humana. Despertamos por el sueño creador a la tragedia que es nuestra tragedia. Esencialmente vulnerable y contingente: por eso la vida trágica. Pero no es la tragedia de un determinado pueblo o raza, sino la condición humana. Antígona somos todos, o podemos sufrir sus mismas calamidades. La tragedia es, entonces, el tiempo de la trascendencia y el argumento de cada vida humana que, como tragedia, la novela, la poesía, darán forma al sueño que despierta. Para esto se necesita la trascendencia de la carne en el tiempo, ir más allá de la frontera marcada por la mismidad racional del geómetra, al otro lado, escribe Zambrano, de nuestro ensimismamiento y subjetividad; del otro lado de la conciencia autovigilante.

"Emblems of Desire: Selections from the ""delie"" of Maurice Sceve",,"['Poetry', 'France']","This is the first large-scale English translation of Maurice Sceve's poem cycle Delie, originally published in Lyons in 1544 and only rediscovered in the early twentieth century as one of the great forgotten masterpieces of French poetry. A contemporary of Sir Thomas Wyatt in England, Sceve occupies a crucial place in the history of French verse between the late medieval tradition of Marot and the more self-consciously Renaissance poetics of the Pleiade. Powerfully registering the early impact of Petrarch's Rime in France, Sceve's canzoniere nonetheless establishes itself as a strongly independent and fiercely idiosyncratic series of 449 love poems addressed to the poet's mysterious object of desire, Delie. Often considered a sixteenth-century Mallarme because of the radiant obscurity of his verse, Sceve emerges in these English translations as a poet whose passionate ironies can be compared to such English metaphysicals as Donne while at the same time evoking the oblique self-portraiture of John Ashbery.Introduced and annotated by the prize-winning translator Richard Sieburth, this bilingual selection from Sceve's Delie (which also includes the fifty emblems illustrating the original edition) will appeal not only to students of French literature and lovers of poetry but also to the broader audience of readers drawn to the visual and verbal universe of the Renaissance.Honorable Mention, 2003 Weidenfeld Translation PrizeHonorable Mention, 2003 PEN Poetry Translation Award",,,October 9th 2002,November 6th 2002,[],Hardcover,,9780812236941,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348609417l/1045912.jpg,4.39,[],41.0,1.0,,,,94.0,18.0,,University of Pennsylvania Press,"['11', '4', '2', '1', '0']",,[],,['Maurice Scève']

As the son of an impoverished mother, he had no other career choice open to him. And Alberich had risen in the ranks with almost unnatural speed. He developed expertise with many weapons and excelled in academic subjects with an ease that was the envy of his classmates. But in fact, the reclusive Alberich studied long and hard, pushing himself ruthlessly.   In battle, Alberich had always had a sort of “sixth sense” about things which were about to happen—when and from where the enemy would attack. Instinctively, he his this ability, for the Sunpriests kept careful watch for anyone exhibiting “demon powers” which were the hallmark of Karse’s greatest enemy—the witch-nation of Valdemar. Those they caught were “cleansed” in the fires of Vkandis Sunlord.   Both Alberich’s skill and secret served him well in the army of Karse, and when Alberich became one of Karse’s youngest captains, he received a special gift—a powerful white stallion “liberated” from the enemy. But this honor was merely a distraction, for the Sunpriests had laid a trap which even Alberich’s strange foresight could not predict…   Saved from burning as a witch when this odd white stallion braved flames and carried him over the border into Valdemar, he was healed by the same enemies he had been taught to hate his entire life. Though he knew he could never again return to his home, Alberich also knew he could never truly become a Valdemaran.

Elric of Melniboné,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Sword and Sorcery', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels']","Elric of Melniboné is a requisite title in the hard fantasy canon, a book no fantasy fan should leave unread. Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which Elric of Melniboné is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melniboné, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre.The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. Elric of Melniboné follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. --Paul Hughes",The Elric Saga #1,,10/28/72,July 15th 1987,"['Cymoril', 'Elric of Melniboné', 'Yyrkoon', 'Rackhir']",Mass Market Paperback,,9780441203987,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388345555l/30036.jpg,3.89,[],633.0,7.0,,,,92.0,22916.0,181,Ace Books,"['6974', '8708', '5425', '1385', '424']",,['Melniboné'],,['Michael Moorcock']

Elric: The Stealer of Souls,,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Sword and Sorcery', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Short Story Collection', 'Horror']","When Michael Moorcock began chronicling the adventures of the albino sorcerer Elric, last king of decadent Melniboné, and his sentient vampiric sword, Stormbringer, he set out to create a new kind of fantasy adventure, one that broke with tradition and reflected a more up-to-date sophistication of theme and style. The result was a bold and unique hero–weak in body, subtle in mind, dependent on drugs for the vitality to sustain himself–with great crimes behind him and a greater destiny ahead: a rock-and-roll antihero who would channel all the violent excesses of the sixties into one enduring archetype.Here is the first volume of a collection of stories containing the seminal appearances of Elric and lavishly illustrated by artist John Picacio–plus essays, letters, maps, and other material. Adventures include “The Dreaming City,” “While the Gods Laugh,” “Kings in Darkness,” “Dead God’s Homecoming,” “Black Sword’s Brothers,” and “Sad Giant’s Shield.”",Chronicles of the Last Emperor of Melniboné #1,,11/06/08,February 19th 2008,"['Stormbringer', 'Moonglum', 'Yyrkoon', 'Cymoril', 'Zarozinia', 'Elric of Melniboné']",Paperback,,9780345498625,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320537616l/1890387.jpg,3.78,[],82.0,1.0,,,,88.0,2395.0,458,Del Rey,"['700', '857', '551', '187', '100']",,[],,"['Michael Moorcock', 'John Picacio', 'Alan Moore']"

Exemplary Stories,,Fiction,"Even more popular in their day than Don Quixote, Cervantes's Exemplary Stories (1613) surprise, challenge and delight. Ranging from the picaresque to the satirical, Cervantes's Exemplary Stories defy the conventions of heroic chivalric literature through a combination of comic irony, moral ambiguity, realism, and sheer mirth. With acute narrative skill and deft characterisation, drawing on colloquial language and farce, Cervantes creates a tension between the everyday and the literary, the plausible and the improbable. While encouraging us to reach our own moral conclusions, he also persuades us to accept the coincidental and the incredible: two boys indulge their life of crime at a time of public prayer; a young nobleman undergoes a change of identity at the behest of not a princess but a mere gipsy girl, and, most fantastically, talking dogs philosophize in a ward full of syphilitics. By placing the extraordinary within the contexts of the ordinary, the Exemplary Stories chart new novelistic territory and demonstrate Cervantes at his most imaginative and innovative. This new translation captures the full vigour of Cervantes's wit and makes available two rarely printed tales, `The Illustrious Kitchen Maid' and `The Power of Blood'.",,,,1998.0,,,0192832433,9780192832436,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=62hVBuGPwy4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.73,,,,,,,,,368.0,,,777.0,,,"['Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra', 'Lesley Lipson']"

Fue en Europa donde tomó conciencia de los valores escondidos en la cultura tradicional de los ""hombres de maíz"".

She’s a tomboy, the girl-next-door who fangirls over tons of book boyfriends. He is the high school soccer star, the hot guy that makes girls swoon.To her, he’s simply her best friend, the one who has been there as far back as she can remember. They’ve grown up together in a small town in the midst of vineyards, in the Montagues and Capulets land, and have been best friends since forever. They know each other so well and care for each other, yet all of a sudden every glance, every accidental touch means something different and is weighted with expectation. But fate is capricious, and things become more complicated when Matteo is offered the chance of a lifetime to play for a top league club which means leaving his hometown, and Marika, behind. Matteo’s departure for Milan to follow his dreams will throw everything off balance, thrusting new, challenging situations into their lives: unexplored worlds of pro sport and its opportunities and sacrifices, contracts and huge paychecks, symphonic metal, emotions, teenage trials and tribulations, cyberbullying, awkward relationships, and memories as cutting as a sword slicing through tofu. Unsure whether her feelings are reciprocated and afraid of risking their friendship, Marika rides an emotional rollercoaster of romantic highs and painful losses. And when another guy, vocalist of a local rock band, fills that emptiness in her life, every move, every thought, every feeling gets amplified and everything gets messy, and more intense.If EVERY BOY IS A BOOK, Federico, the sweet musician with the straightened bangs and melodious voice, was undoubtedly created by the pen of Keats or some other tormented Romantic poet; while Matteo is pure passion, like Shakespeare’s Romeo: spontaneous, intense, and impetuously real. If only it were as simple as good guy vs bad guy… but it’s not.   * The original version of the book was much longer.

Exclusion and Embrace,"A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation",Religion,"Life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality. Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion. Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we ""learn to live with one another,"" but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God. Is there any hope of embracing our enemies? Of opening the door to reconciliation? Miroslav Volf, a Yale University theologian, has won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, Exclusion & Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation (Abingdon, 1996). Volf argues that ""exclusion"" of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today. He writes, ""It may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference. The issue is urgent. The ghettos and battlefields throughout the world--in the living rooms, in inner cities, or on the mountain ranges--testify indisputably to its importance."" A Croatian by birth, Volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ""ethnic cleansing"" in the former Yugoslavia, but he readily finds other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. And, since September 11, one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife. Exclusion happens, Volf argues, wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other. It is easy to assume that ""exclusion"" is the problem or practice of ""barbarians"" who live ""over there,"" but Volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice ""here"" as well. Modern western societies, including American society, typically recite their histories as ""narratives of inclusion,"" and Volf celebrates the truth in these narratives. But he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who ""disturb the integrity of their 'happy ending' plots."" Therefore such narratives of inclusion invite ""long and gruesome"" counter-narratives of exclusion--the brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of Native American populations come readily to mind, but more current examples could also be found. Most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangements--what kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference? Volf focuses, rather, on ""what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others."" In addressing the topic, Volf stresses the social implications of divine self-giving. The Christian scriptures attest that God does not abandon the godless to their evil, but gives of Godself to bring them into communion. We are called to do likewise--""whoever our enemies and whoever we may be."" The divine mandate to embrace as God has embraced is summarized in Paul's injunction to the Romans: ""Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you"" (Romans 15:7). Susan R. Garrett, Coordinator of the Religion Award, said that the Grawemeyer selection committee praised Volf's book on many counts. These included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of Scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology, philosophy, critical theory, and feminist theory. ""Volf's focus is not on social strategies or programs but, rather, on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies. He helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence, injustice, and deception."" Garrett added that, although addressed primarily to Christians, Volf's theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity. The call to ""embrace the other"" is never a call to remake the other into one's own image. Volf--who had just delivered a lecture on the topic of Exclusion and Embrace at a prayer breakfast for the United Nations when the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center--will present a lecture and receive his award in Louisville during the first week of April, 2002. The annual Religion Award, which includes a cash prize of $200,000, is given jointly by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the University of Louisville to the authors or originators of creative works that contribute significantly to an understanding of ""the relationship between human beings and the divine, and ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community."" The Grawemeyer awards--given also by the University of Louisville in the fields of musical composition, education, psychology, and world order--honor the virtue of accessibility: works chosen for the awards must be comprehensible to thinking persons who are not specialists in the various fields.",,,,1996.0,,,0687002826,9780687002825,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cqto7sVhTS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.27,,,,,,,,,306.0,,,1895.0,,,['Miroslav Volf']

Pero también está cambiando en sí mismo: cada vez es más difícil de ejercer y más fácil de perder. El resultado, como afirma el prestigioso analista internacional Moisés Naím, es que los líderes actuales tienen menos poder que sus antecesores, y que el potencial para que ocurran cambios repentinos y radicales sea mayor que nunca.En El fin del poder, Naím describe la lucha entre los grandes actores antes dominantes y los nuevos micropoderes que ahora les desafían en todos los ámbitos de la actividad humana. La energía iconoclasta de los micropoderes puede derrocar dictadores, acabar con los monopolios y abrir nuevas e increíbles oportunidades, pero también puede conducir al caos y la parálisis.«El fin del poder cambiará tu manera de leer las noticias, tu manera de pensar en política y tu manera de mirar al mundo.»William Jefferson Clinton «Este libro fascinante debe provocar un debate sobre cómo gobernar un mundo en el que cada vez participan más personas.»

Europe,A History,History,"Here is a masterpiece of historical narrative that stretches from the Ice Age to the Atomic Age, as it tells the story of Europe, East and West. Norman Davies captures it all-the rise and fall of Rome, the sweeping invasions of Alaric and Atilla, the Norman Conquests, the Papal struggles for power, the Renaissance and the Reformation, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, Europe's rise to become the powerhouse of the world, and its eclipse in our own century, following two devastating World Wars. This is the first major history of Europe to give equal weight to both East and West, and it shines light on fascinating minority communities, from heretics and lepers to Gypsies, Jews, and Muslims. It also takes an innovative approach, combining traditional narrative with unique features that help bring history alive: 299 time capsules scattered through the narrative capture telling aspects of an era. 12 -snapshots offer a panoramic look at all of Europe at a particular moment in history.

En la segunda parte de su libro, Paz examina las diferencias y semejanzas entre la experiencia poética y la religiosa, dedica un capítulo al espinoso problema de la 'inspiración' y concluye afirmando que la experiencia poética es irreductible a cualquiera otra.",,3rd edition Sección de Lengua y Estudios Literarios,11/06/56,1972,[],Paperback,,9789681607821,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348749260l/80483.jpg,4.27,[],91.0,1.0,,,,96.0,429.0,307,Fondo de Cultura Económica,"['213', '142', '57', '12', '5']",,[],,['Octavio Paz']

But things were quiet now, had been quiet for a year, and it was plain to him now that they would not bring him back at all, that he was much more useful as a name and a story than he would ever be as an inconvenient flesh-and-blood person.At the close of Ender's Game, Andrew Wiggin--called Ender by everyone--knows that he cannot live on Earth. He has become far more than just a boy who won a game: He is the Savior of Earth, a hero, a military genius whose allegiance is sought by every nation of the newly shattered Earth Hegemony.He is offered the choice of living under the Hegemon's control, a pawn in his brother Peter's political games. Or he can join the colony ships and go out to settle one of the new worlds won in the war.The story of those years on the colony worlds has never been told...until now.The voyage was long. By the end of it, Val had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, back to Earth, and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers. They knew him now, and he had won their love and their respect.Ender was twelve when he chose to leave his home world and begin the long relativistic journey out to the colonies. With him went his sister, Valentine, and the core of the artificial intelligence that would become Jane. He wrote The Hive Queen and The Hegemon, and his sister wrote The Speaker for the Dead.He served as governor of his first colony world, but now Ender is on the move, looking for a planet where the hive queens might be reestablished.What he finds in the Ganges colony is more than he bargained for--a resentful governor who caused a devastating war on Earth and a brilliant young colonist who is out to destroy him, starting with his reputation and ending, perhaps, with his life.",Enderverse: Publication Order #11,,,November 11th 2008,"['Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Andrew Wiggin']",Hardcover,,9780765304964,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442883678l/3220405._SX318_.jpg,3.91,[],663.0,7.0,,,,94.0,44894.0,369,St. Martins Press-3PL,"['12882', '18017', '11396', '2108', '491']",,[],,['Orson Scott Card']

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com",Ender's Saga #1,Unabridged,10/28/85,09/30/04,"['Dink', 'Bernard', 'Valentine Wiggin', 'Peter Wiggin', 'Mazer Rackham', 'Alai', 'Hyrum Graff', 'Andrew Wiggin', 'Petra Arkanian', '""Bean""', 'Major Anderson', 'Bonzo', 'Major Imbu']",Audiobook,,9780812550702,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg,4.3,"['Hugo Award for Best Novel (1986)', 'Nebula Award for Best Novel (1985)', 'Nébula (1985)', 'Margaret A.

"Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che",,"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Biography Memoir', 'Unfinished']","Desde millones de fotos, carteles, vídeos, camisetas, postales, discos, libros, frases, testimonios —fantasmas todos ellos de la sociedad industrial, que no sabe depositar sus mitos en la sobriedad de la memoria—, el Che nos vigila. Más allá de toda parafernalia, retorna. Casi treinta años después de su muerte, su imagen cruza generaciones, su mito persigue los delirios de grandeza del neoliberalismo. Irreverente, burlón, terco —moralmente terco—, el Che siempre será motivo de debate.Con abundante material hasta ahora inédito —fotos, testimonios, diarios…—, Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che es una biografía minuciosa y detallada que nos revela a un personaje diferente del que creemos conocer; un hombre que, siendo ministro de Industria en Cuba, jamás terminaba de amarrarse las botas. Es un encuentro con Ernesto Guevara, más allá del Che, pero también una reelaboración del mito.

The people who dwell there create fictions for a living, fictions that refuse tidily to confine themselves to the screen, but spill over into the daily lives of the men and women who regard themselves as stars in the movies of their own lives. Although this book tells readers altogether more than they may wish to know about the Hollywood of the '70s, I do not flatter myself that I have arrived at ""the truth."" At the end of this long, twisted road I am once again struck with the force of the old maxim, the more you know, the more you know what you don't know. This is particularly true in the case of Hollywood, where despite the reams of memos and contracts that now gather dust on the shelves of university libraries, very little of what really matters is committed to paper, so that an endeavor of this sort is dependent on memory -- in this case of an era twenty or thirty years in the past. Not only is the terrain distant, but in this period memory has been enfeebled by booze and drugs.In a town where credit grabbing is an art form, to say that memory is self-serving is to say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Moreover, defect of memory is a shield that enables people to go to work in the morning, protecting them from the unspeakable behavior that is taken for granted there. As director Paul Schrader puts it, ""In this business, you've got to have a selective memory. Otherwise, it's too painful."" Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" remains one of the truest movies about the movies and the people who make them.In this maze of mirrors, lucky is the chronicler who does not lose his or her way in the infini, Alice Mayhew gave ither blessing, and Bob Bender, along with his assistant, Johanna Li, helped it to see the light of day.

Ecology Of The Automobile,,[],"Carefully researched, The Ecology of the Automobile is a classic that examines the central role that auto production and consumption have played in the 20th Century.More than seventeen million people have been killed on roads since the automobile first appeared. (1993) An incalculable number have been seriously hurt. In the future, half the world is likely to be run over in a terminal squabble for oil. For today we are possessed by a mindless monster which threatens the planet itself.Considering the widespread impact of the auto on many contemporary societies, it is surprising how little attention its social and political dimensions receive - even from ecologically oriented thinkers. This, despite the fact that vehicular traffic is viewed as a major problem.In this original book, authors Freund and Martin examine the central role that auto production and consumption have played in the twentieth century: as a technological system with major impacts on public policy, land use, cultural patterns, social relations, community, natural resources, environmental quality and options for spatial mobility. The overuse and misuse that has caused auto saturation and the costs of auto-centred transport are identified. Individualist and consumerist ideologies that tend to obscure the problems of auto hegemony, including environmental and public health effects, are vigorously questioned.""For policymakers and others interested in a critical appraisal of auto dependence.""--Earthwatch""An excellent read for those interested in the environmental impacts and social role of the automobile.

"Everybody Out of the Laundromat, I Need to Think!",,[],"When the ordinary life of Virgil Blaine crosses the path of the even more ordinary Doug Coulthard, it sets off a series of extra-ordinary events. Doug Coulthard is a Filing Clerk and the President of the Unpublished People’s Poet’s Party –Political Unit (UPPPPU) where a catastrophe has just happened; two of his long time members have been published. The UPPPPU goes on a recruiting drive by distributing leaflets, one of which finds its way into Virgil Blaine’s pocket. Virgil Blaine, who is a slight poet himself, attends one of the meetings where he meets Forward Slash who offers Virgil Blaine a job. The offer comes with two things Virgil Blaine has never had; a job and a car and on a whim he accepts. The problem is, through no effort of his own, his position is suddenly elevated. Virgil Blaine says the job is ‘messing with his DNA – Deliberate Non-Achiever’ and he misses his old life and so hatches a plan to get it back…Though very ordinary, Doug Coulthard has the distinction of being only one of four hundred and thirty one Earth creatures who have been abducted by Aliens. The Aliens took Doug to the Canis Minor and back, a round trip of 3.02 parsecs. Due to the spacecraft’s immense velocity Doug was left with an annoying and sudden ‘tic’ which is to nod his head up and down rather abruptly every four minutes. And now the Aliens are back to take Doug on a ‘quite a few years since we last picked you up’ Reunion Party which turns out to be one of the worst experiences of Doug’s life….",,,,August 29th 2013,[],ebook,,9781612132372,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377814055l/18397548.jpg,4.9,[],200.0,2.0,,,,100.0,10.0,135,The Writer's Coffee Shop Publishing House,"['9', '1', '0', '0', '0']",,[],,['Phil G.

Exit Ghost,,"['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Jewish', 'Americana', 'The United States Of America', 'Roman']","Like Rip Van Winkle returning to his hometown to find that all has changed, Nathan Zuckerman comes back to New York, the city he left eleven years before. Alone on his New England mountain, Zuckerman has been nothing but a writer: no voices, no media, no terrorist threats, no women, no news, no tasks other than his work and the enduring of old age.Walking the streets like a revenant, he quickly makes three connections that explode his carefully protected solitude. One is with a young couple with whom, in a rash moment, he offers to swap homes. They will flee post-9/11 Manhattan for his country refuge, and he will return to city life. But from the time he meets them, Zuckerman also wants to swap his solitude for the erotic challenge of the young woman, Jamie, whose allure draws him back to all that he thought he had left behind: intimacy, the vibrant play of heart and body.The second connection is with a figure from Zuckerman’s youth, Amy Bellette, companion and muse to Zuckerman’s first literary hero, E. I. Lonoff. The once irresistible Amy is now an old woman depleted by illness, guarding the memory of that grandly austere American writer who showed Nathan the solitary path to a writing vocation.The third connection is with Lonoff’s would-be biographer, a young literary hound who will do and say nearly anything to get to Lonoff’s “great secret.” Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be involved again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman plays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities.Haunted by Roth’s earlier work The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost is an amazing leap into yet another phase in this great writer’s insatiable commitment to fiction.",Complete Nathan Zuckerman #9,,,October 1st 2007,"['Nathan Zuckerman', 'Amy Bellette', 'Jamie Logan', 'Nathan', 'Billy Davidoff', 'Richard Kliman']",Hardcover,,9780618915477,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327631702l/703163.jpg,3.49,[],57.0,1.0,,,,88.0,4886.0,292,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['648', '1842', '1791', '484', '121']",,"['Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)', 'Upper West Side, Manhattan, New York (United States)']",,['Philip Roth']

Apenas ha transcurrido un ano desde el final de la guerra cuando una muerte rompe la tranquilidad de un pequeno pueblo perdido en las montanas. El unico extranjero del lugar a quien llaman Der Anderer el Otro en aleman ha sido asesinado y todos los hombres de la localidad se confiesan autores del crimen. Todos menos Brodeck quien recibe el encargo de redactar un informe sobre lo sucedido para que quienes lo lean puedan comprender y perdonar . Asi pues Brodeck entrevista a los hombres mas importantes del pueblo: el cura el dueno de la fonda el alcalde... Y cuando este ultimo le advierte de que no busque lo que no existe. O lo que existio pero ya no existe Brodeck comprende que no le conviene saber demasiado. Sin embargo la redaccion del informe lo obliga a interrogar y a interrogarse lo que a la postre puede suponer una amenaza para el y su familia. Considerado actualmente uno de los mejores novelistas franceses de su generacion Philippe Claudel renueva su exploracion de los recodos mas sombrios del ser humano y sus complejos mecanismos.

Not only a document of profound philosophical importance in its own right, it also contributes to the understanding of Platonic dialogues that followed it, and it exhibits the foundations of the physics and ontology that Aristotle offered in his Physics and Metaphysics VII. In this book, R.E. Allen provides a superb translation of the Parmenides along with a structural analysis that procedes on the assumption that formal elements, logical and dramatic, are important to its interpretation and that the argument of the Parmenides is aporetic, a statement of metaphysical perplexities.

Evening Is the Whole Day,,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Asia', 'India', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Asian Literature', 'Family', 'Adult Fiction', 'Childrens']","Set in Malaysia, this spellbinding and already internationally acclaimed debut introduces us to the prosperous Rajasekharan family as its closely guarded secrets are slowly peeled away.When Chellam, the family’s rubber-plantation-bred servant girl, is dismissed for unnamed crimes, her banishment is the latest in a series of recent, precipitous losses that have shaken six-year-old Aasha’s life. A few short weeks before, Aasha’s grandmother Paati passed away under mysterious circumstances and her older sister, Uma, departed for Columbia University--leaving Aasha alone to cope with her mostly absent father, her bitter mother, and her imperturbable older brother.Beginning with Aasha’s grandfather’s ascension from Indian coolie to illustrious resident of the Big House on Kingfisher Lane, and going on to tell the story of how Appa, the family’s Oxford-educated patriarch, courted Amma, the humble girl next door, Evening Is the Whole Day moves gracefully backward and forward in time to answer the many questions that haunt the family: What was Chellam’s unforgivable crime? Why was Uma so intent on leaving? How and why did Paati die? What did Aasha see?

Her feet were firmly planted in suburban reality and she had no reason to believe her life would be anything but that of a typical teenager. That is until tonight, when Cassie saw something that no human was ever supposed to see; in the blink of an eye she was thrown into the world of the Light and Dark Elves.He comes from a realm where light and dark have fought for millennia. He is of a race known to humans only in myths and legends. The darkness that lives inside him is a part of both who and what he is and it makes him the most gifted spy and assassin in the history of his time. His life is not his own; he lives in the service of the Dark Elf King. He slays who he must, has mercy on no one, is relentless in his hunt, and never tires of seeing his prey fall. He is Triktapic, assassin, spy, most feared of the Dark Elves.Now, in the midst of his King’s complicated plans to expand the Dark Elves’ holdings into the mortal realm, for the first time, Trik finds his loyalties divided. For no Elf, Dark or Light, can turn away from their Chosen.Unbeknownst to the mortal realm, the battle between Light and Dark is being brought to their doorstep. The only one who can keep it at bay holds darkness in his heart like a lover, and the one who can sway that heart must decide if she can look beyond his black past, beyond his evil nature and see the man he is destined to be.The question must be asked, does love really cover a multitude of sins?

Essays and Lectures,,"['Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'American', '19th Century', 'History', 'Poetry', 'Politics']","This first Library of America volume of Emerson’s writing covers the most productive period of his life, 1832–1860. Our most eloquent champion of individualism, Emerson acknowledges at the same time the countervailing pressures of society in American life. Even as he extols what he called “the great and crescive self,” he dramatizes and records its vicissitudes.Here are the indispensable and most renowned works, including “The American Scholar” (“our intellectual Declaration of Independence,” as Oliver Wendell Holmes called it), “The Divinity School Address,” considered atheistic by many of his listeners, the summons to “Self-Reliance,” along with the more embattled realizations of “Circles” and, especially, “Experience.” Here, too, are his wide-ranging portraits of Montaigne, Shakespeare, and other “representative men,” and his astute observations on the habits, lives, and prospects of the English and American people.This volume includes Emerson’s well-known Nature; Addresses, and Lectures (1849), his Essays: First Series (1841) and Essays: Second Series (1844), plus Representative Men (1850), English Traits (1856), and his later book of essays, The Conduct of Life (1860). These are the works that established Emerson’s colossal reputation in America and found him admirers abroad as diverse as Carlyle, Nietzsche, and Proust.Emerson’s enduring power is apparent everywhere in American literature: in those, like Whitman and some of the major twentieth-century poets, who seek to corroborate his vision, and among those, like Hawthorne and Melville, who questioned, qualified, and struggled with it. Emerson’s vision reverberates also in the tradition of American philosophy, notably in the writings of William James and John Dewey, in the works of his European admirers, such as Nietzsche, and in the avant-garde theorists of our own day who write on the nature and function of language.

Escaping Salem: The Other Witch Hunt of 1692,,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Witches', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Paranormal', 'True Crime', 'Witchcraft']","The Salem witch hunt of 1692 is among the most infamous events in early American history; however, it was not the only such episode to occur in New England that year. Escaping Salem reconstructs the ""other witch hunt"" of 1692 that took place in Stamford, Connecticut. Concise and accessible, the book takes students on a revealing journey into the mental world of early America, shattering the stereotype of early New Englanders as quick to accuse and condemn.  Drawing on eyewitness testimony, Richard Godbeer tells the story of Kate Branch, a seventeen-year-old afflicted by strange visions and given to blood-chilling wails of pain and fright. Branch accused several women of bewitching her, two of whom were put on trial for witchcraft. Escaping Salem takes us inside the Connecticut courtroom and into the minds of the surprisingly skeptical Stamford townspeople. Were the pain and screaming due to natural or supernatural causes? Was Branch simply faking the symptoms? And if she was indeed bewitched, why believe her specific accusations, since her information came from demons who might well be lying? For the judges, Godbeer shows, the trial was a legal thicket. All agreed that witches posed a real and serious threat, but proving witchcraft (an invisible crime) in court was another matter. The court in Salem had become mired in controversy over its use of dubious evidence. In an intriguing chapter, Godbeer examines Magistrate Jonathan Selleck's notes on how to determine the guilt of someone accused of witchcraft, providing an illuminating look at what constituted proof of witchcraft at the time. The stakes were high--if found guilty, the two accused women would be hanged.  In the afterword, Godbeer explains how he used the trial evidence to build his narrative, offering an inside perspective on the historian's craft. Featuring maps, photos, and a selected bibliography, Escaping Salem is ideal for use in undergraduate U.S. survey courses. It can also be used for courses in colonial American history, culture, and religion; witchcraft in the early modern world; and crime and society in early America.",,,10/01/04,January 6th 2005,[],Paperback,,9780195161304,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347512967l/982464.jpg,3.5,[],70.0,1.0,,,,88.0,354.0,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['48', '128', '136', '37', '5']",,"['Stamford, Connecticut (United States)']",,['Richard Godbeer']

Ride along on this breath stopping journey of the heart, mind and soul of a 19 year old Marine to 1969 Vietnam. It's a full ride."" This story will grab hold of you and not let go.

Students of Vietnam will experience a virtual reality tour in Nam through Thompson. His description of action is so realistic, so emotionally compelling, that you live Thompson's tour.

The World Government calls upon him for aid in protecting an alien diplomat from a powerful and hostile member of his own species. Knowing both the importance of the task and his inability to handle it on his own, Singer goes to confront his greatest conquest with a strange bargain. A shape-shifting alien, the last of his species, sits in a special cage at an institute dedicated to the study of extraterrestrial beings. Most frequently he projects the aspect of a one-eyed catlike creature, but he can appear as almost anything.One of Singer’s secrets, and his greatest guilt, is his suspicion that the creature is intelligent. He confronts him and offers his own life for Cat’s cooperation in saving the alien. Cat accepts, and later, their mission fulfilled, demands a refinement on the original bargain. Rather than a simple death he wants a return bout—a chase with Singer as the hunted rather than the hunter.The gods, powers and monsters of Navajo legend provide the backdrop for the working out of Singer’s fate—for the chase is as much for his soul as for his body. As he uses matter transmitters to flit from Paris to London to the Middle East to the American Southwest, he must search back into his own early life as well as the root beliefs of his vanished people and come to terms with a world that has adopted him, made use of his skills, and left him feeling that he has no place to call his own.",,,01/01/82,September 1st 1982,[],Hardcover,,9780671255190,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181143605l/1117637.jpg,3.64,['Locus Award Nominee for Best Novel (1983)'],88.0,1.0,,,,91.0,1593.0,181,Timescape/SFBC,"['310', '567', '571', '122', '23']",,[],,['Roger Zelazny']
Elements of Semiology,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Theory', 'Semiotics', 'Linguistics', 'France', 'Language', 'Research', 'Criticism', 'Academic']","""In his Course in General Linguistics, first published in 1916, Saussure postulated the existence of a general science of signs, or Semiology, of which linguistics would form only one part. Semiology, therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification . . . The Elements here presented have as their sole aim the extraction from linguistics of analytical concepts which we think a priori to be sufficiently general to start semiological research on its way. In assembling them, it is not presupposed that they will remain intact during the course of research; nor that semiology will always be forced to follow the linguistic model closely. We are merely suggesting and elucidating a terminology in the hope that it may enable an initial (albeit provisional) order to be introduced into the heterogeneous mass of significant facts. In fact what we purport to do is furnish a principle of classification of the questions. These elements of semiology will therefore be grouped under four main headings borrowed from structural linguistics: I. Language and Speech; II. Signified and Signifier; III. Syntagm and System; IV.

Ego Is the Enemy,,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Leadership', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Productivity']","“While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” – from the PrologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”",,,,June 14th 2016,[],Hardcover,,9781591847816,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459114043l/27036528.jpg,4.16,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Nonfiction (2016)'],98.0,1.0,,,,94.0,34892.0,226,Portfolio,"['15609', '11898', '5416', '1376', '593']",,[],,['Ryan Holiday']

"Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History",,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'American History', 'Native Americans', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Native American History']","In the tradition of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, a stunningly vivid historical account of the forty-year battle between Comanche Indians and white settlers for control of the American West, centering on Quanah, the greatest Comanche chief of them all.S. C. Gwynne’s Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun. The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne’s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads—a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the ""White Squaw"" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah, a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend. S. C. Gwynne’s account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told.",,,03/25/10,May 25th 2010,[],Hardcover,,9781416591054,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1395176404l/7648269.jpg,4.17,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for General Nonfiction (2010)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for General Nonfiction (2010)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History and Biography (2010)']",595.0,7.0,,,,95.0,33719.0,384,Scribner,"['14557', '12655', '4846', '1102', '559']",,[],,['S.

Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch,,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical', 'British Literature', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Adult', 'Womens']","Perfect for fans of The Crown, this magisterial biography of Queen Elizabeth II is a close-up view of the woman we’ve known only from a distance—and a captivating window into the last great monarchy.From the moment of her ascension to the throne in 1952 at the age of twenty-five, Queen Elizabeth II has been the object of unparalleled scrutiny. But through the fog of glamour and gossip, how well do we really know the world’s most famous monarch? Drawing on numerous interviews and never-before-revealed documents, acclaimed biographer Sally Bedell Smith pulls back the curtain to show in intimate detail the public and private lives of Queen Elizabeth II, who has led her country and Commonwealth through the wars and upheavals of the last sixty years with unparalleled composure, intelligence, and grace.  In Elizabeth the Queen, we meet the young girl who suddenly becomes “heiress presumptive” when her uncle abdicates the throne. We meet the thirteen-year-old Lilibet as she falls in love with a young navy cadet named Philip and becomes determined to marry him, even though her parents prefer wealthier English aristocrats. We see the teenage Lilibet repairing army trucks during World War II and standing with Winston Churchill on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on V-E Day. We see the young Queen struggling to balance the demands of her job with her role as the mother of two young children. Sally Bedell Smith brings us inside the palace doors and into the Queen’s daily routines—the “red boxes” of documents she reviews each day, the weekly meetings she has had with twelve prime ministers, her physically demanding tours abroad, and the constant scrutiny of the press—as well as her personal relationships: with Prince Philip, her husband of sixty-four years and the love of her life; her children and their often-disastrous marriages; her grandchildren and friends.",,,,January 10th 2012,['Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom'],Hardcover,,9781400067893,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1324343095l/12722468.jpg,3.87,['Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography (2012)'],86.0,1.0,,,,90.0,26078.0,663,Random House,"['8898', '8603', '5914', '1613', '1050']",,[],,['Sally Bedell Smith']

Sara Hagerty found him when life stopped working for her. She found him when she was a young adult mired in spiritual busyness and when she was a new bride with doubts about whether her fledgling marriage would survive. She found him alone in the night as she cradled her longing for babies who did not come. She found him as she kissed the faces of children on another continent who had lived years without a mommy’s touch.In Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet, Hagerty masterfully draws from the narrative of her life to craft a mosaic of a God who leans into broken stories. Here readers see a God who is present in every changing circumstance. Most significantly, they see a God who is present in every unchanging circumstance as well.Whatever lost expectations readers are facing—in family, career, singleness, or marriage—Every Bitter Thing Is Sweet will bring them closer to a God who longs for them to know him more. What does it look like to know God’s nearness when life breaks? What does it mean to receive his life when earthly life remains barren? How can God turn the bitterness of unmet desire into new flavors of joy?With exquisite storytelling and reflection, Hagerty brings readers back to hope, back to healing, back to a place that God is holding for them alone—a place where the unseen is more real than what the eye can perceive.

Eros: A Journey of Multiple Loves,,"['LGBT', 'Nonfiction', 'Polyamory', 'Queer', 'Sexuality']","Eros: A Journey of Multiple Loves is a poignant memoir that explores the evolution of erotic love through the international and transcultural journeys of an extraordinary woman. This captivating book chronicles the life of polyamorous advocate and postmodern nomad Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio, whose skillful prose takes readers along the bold twists and turns of her life, and her irreverent critiques of society, education, and sexuality.In Eros, Anderlini-D'Onofrio describes her formative years in the politically charged Italy of the 1960s and 1970 as well as her development as an independent woman and single mother in America.

Inside the Forbidden City, she witnessed seductions, plots, murders, and brazen acts of treason. Propelled by a shrewd intelligence, an extraordinary persistence, and a friendship with the imperial heir, she rose through the ranks to become the first Empress of China.

He’s painfully shy, physically inept, and his new nick-name, “chunk style,” is in danger of entering common usage.

El Libertador,Writings of Simón Bolívar,Literary Collections,"General Simï¿½n Bolï¿½var (1783-1830), called El Liberator, and sometimes the ""George Washington"" of Latin America, was the leading hero of the Latin American independence movement. His victories over Spain won independence for Bolivia, Panama, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Bolï¿½var became Columbia's first president in 1819. In 1822, he became dictator of Peru. Upper Peru became a separate state, which was named Bolivia in Bolï¿½var's honor, in 1825. The constitution, which he drew up for Bolivia, is one of his most important political pronouncements. Today he is remembered throughout South America, and in Venezuela and Bolivia his birthday is a national holiday. Although Bolï¿½var never prepared a systematic treatise, his essays, proclamations, and letters constitute some of the most eloquent writing not of the independence period alone, but of any period in Latin American history. His analysis of the region's fundamental problems, ideas on political organization and proposals for Latin American integration are relevant and widely read today, even among Latin Americans of all countries and of all political persuasions.

When Enrique is five years old, his mother, Lourdes, too poor to feed her children, leaves Honduras to work in the United States. The move allows her to send money back home to Enrique so he can eat better and go to school past the third grade.Lourdes promises Enrique she will return quickly. But she struggles in America. Years pass. He begs for his mother to come back. Without her, he becomes lonely and troubled. When she calls, Lourdes tells him to be patient. Enrique despairs of ever seeing her again. After eleven years apart, he decides he will go find her.Enrique sets off alone from Tegucigalpa, with little more than a slip of paper bearing his mother's North Carolina telephone number. Without money, he will make the dangerous and illegal trek up the length of Mexico the only way he can – clinging to the sides and tops of freight trains.With gritty determination and a deep longing to be by his mother's side, Enrique travels through hostile, unknown worlds. Each step of the way through Mexico, he and other migrants, many of them children, are hunted like animals. Gangsters control the tops of the trains. Bandits rob and kill migrants up and down the tracks. Corrupt cops all along the route are out to fleece and deport them. To evade Mexican police and immigration authorities, they must jump onto and off the moving boxcars they call El Tren de la Muerte- The Train of Death. Enrique pushes forward using his wit, courage, and hope - and the kindness of strangers. It is an epic journey, one thousands of immigrant children make each year to find their mothers in the United States.Based on the Los Angeles Times newspaper series that won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for feature writing and another for feature photography, Enrique's Journey is the timeless story of families torn apart, the yearning to be together again, and a boy who will risk his life to find the mother he loves.",,,02/01/05,January 2nd 2007,[],Paperback,,9780812971781,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320543035l/158277.jpg,3.87,"['California Book Award for Nonfiction (Silver) (2006)', 'One Book One San Diego (2007)']",96.0,1.0,,,,92.0,12499.0,294,Random House Trade Paperbacks,"['3510', '5017', '2979', '775', '218']",,[],,['Sonia Nazario']

""Empire of Blue Water"" is the real story of the pirates of the Caribbean. Henry Morgan, a twenty-year-old Welshman, crossed the Atlantic in 1655, hell-bent on making his fortune. Over the next three decades, his exploits in the Caribbean in the service of the English became legendary. His daring attacks on the mighty Spanish Empire on land and at sea determined the fates of kings and queens, and his victories helped shape the destiny of the New World. Morgan gathered disaffected European sailors and soldiers, hard-bitten adventurers, runaway slaves, and vicious cutthroats, and turned them into the most feared army in the Western Hemisphere. Sailing out from the English stronghold of Port Royal, Jamaica, ""the wickedest city in the New World,"" Morgan and his men terrorized Spanish merchant ships and devastated the cities where great riches in silver, gold, and gems lay waiting. His last raid, a daring assault on the fabled city of Panama, helped break Spain's hold on the Americas forever. Awash with bloody battles, political intrigues, natural disaster, and a cast of characters more compelling, bizarre, and memorable than any found in a Hollywood swashbuckler--including the notorious pirate L'Ollonais, the soul-tortured King Philip IV of Spain, and Thomas Modyford, the crafty English governor of Jamaica--""Empire of Blue Water"" brilliantly re-creates the passions and the violence of the age of exploration and empire.

Ambrose draws upon extensive sources, an unprecedented degree of scholarship, and numerous interviews with Eisenhower himself to offer the fullest, richest, most objective rendering yet of the soldier who became president.

Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibney—the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfield’s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Bill’s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark.

In a secluded woodland castle an old General prepares to receive a rare visitor, a man who was once his closest friend but who he has not seen in forty-one years. Over the ensuing hours host and guest will fight a duel of words and silences, accusations and evasions. They will exhume the memory of their friendship and that of the General’s beautiful, long-dead wife. And they will return to the time the three of them last sat together following a hunt in the nearby forest--a hunt in which no game was taken but during which something was lost forever.

Either/Or is the earliest of the major works of Søren Kierkegaard, one of the most startlingly original thinkers and writers of the nineteenth century, and the first which he wrote under a pseudonym, as he would for his greatest philosophical writings. Adopting the viewpoints of two distinct figures with radically different beliefs--the aesthetic young man of Part One, called simply 'A', and the ethical Judge Vilhelm of the second section--Kierkegaard reflects upon the search for a meaningful existence, contemplating subjects as diverse as Mozart, drama, boredom, and, in the famous Seducer's Diary, the cynical seduction and ultimate rejection of a young, beautiful woman. A masterpiece of duality, Either/Or is an exploration of the conflict between the aesthetic and the ethical--both meditating ironically and seductively upon Epicurean pleasures, and eloquently expounding the noble virtues of a morally upstanding life.This lightly abridged edition fully conveys the vigour and eloquence of the original.

Educated,,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Education', 'Religion']","Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found here",,,,February 20th 2018,[],Hardcover,,9780399590504,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635l/35133922.jpg,4.47,"['Audie Award for Best Female Narrator (2019)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Biography (2018)', 'ALA Alex Award (2019)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Longlist (2019)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Autobiography (2018)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography (2018)', 'PEN/Jean Stein Book Award Nominee for Shortlist (2019)', 'Reading Women Award for Nonfiction (2018)']",3826.0,42.0,,,,98.0,796019.0,334,Random House,"['477689', '236894', '62027', '12742', '6667']",,"['Idaho Mountains (United States)', 'Idaho (United States)', 'Arizona (United States)', 'Rome (Italy)', 'Paris (France)', 'Palmyra, New York (United States)', 'Boston, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Cambridge, England (United Kingdom)']",,['Tara Westover']

But, while there has long been help to save humans, there wasn't anyone who focused on helping the animals. This is why EARS—Emergency Animal Rescue Service—came into being. Inside are the real-life stories of EARS volunteers, and how their efforts have saved countless animals from certain death. You will read about the touching reunions of pet owners with the cherished pets they feared were dead.

His work is both tough and tender, primordial and new - always revealing the raw, instinctual drives that lure us together and rend us apart. In Eyrie, Winton crafts the story of Tom Keely, a man struggling to accomplish good in an utterly fallen world. Once an ambitious, altruistic environmentalist, Keely now finds himself broke, embroiled in scandal, and struggling to piece together some semblance of a life. From the heights of his urban high-rise apartment, he surveys the wreckage of his life and the world he's tumbled out of love with. Just before he descends completely into pills and sorrow, a woman from his past and her preternatural child appear, perched on the edge of disaster, desperate for help. When you're fighting to keep your head above water, how can you save someone else from drowning? As Keely slips into a nightmarish world of con artists, drug dealers, petty violence, and extortion, Winton confronts the cost of benevolence and creates a landscape of uncertainty.

After leading a team of commandos deep into Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from joining the nuclear arms race, he was publicly hailed by the president as the single most important person in the fight against terrorism. But after years of working covertly behind the scenes, Rapp now lives in the glare of the public spotlight, lauded by the nation and an easy target for virtually every terrorist from Jakarta to London.As special advisor on counterterrorism to CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy, Rapp is ready to fight the war on terrorism from CIA headquarters rather than the front line. That is, until a platoon of Navy SEALs, sent to the Philippines to save an American family kidnapped by radical Islamic terrorists, is caught in a deadly ambush. The mission had been top secret -- so who told the enemy? All evidence points to the State Department and the Philippine embassy. But a greater threat still lurks. An unknown assassin working closely with the highest powers in the Middle East is bent on igniting war. Now, with the world watching his every move, will Rapp be able to overcome this anonymous foe and once again keep the flames of war from raging?Transporting us into an intriguing geopolitical puzzle full of deadly motives, covert operatives, and all the true-to-life insider detail we've come to expect from Vince Flynn, ""Executive Power"" is a high-flying story that delivers shattering suspense with the velocity of a 9mmbullet.",Mitch Rapp #6,,05/06/03,April 27th 2004,[],Paperback,,9780743453967,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442431876l/777211._SY475_.jpg,4.3,[],280.0,4.0,,,,97.0,41752.0,512,Pocket Star Books,"['20147', '15323', '5209', '766', '307']",,[],,['Vince Flynn']

Ever Yours: The Essential Letters,,"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Unfinished', 'Art History']","""There is scarcely one letter by Van Gogh which I, who am certainly no expert, do not find fascinating."" —W. H. Auden In addition to his many remarkable paintings and drawings, Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) left behind a fascinating and voluminous body of correspondence. This highly accessible book includes a broad selection of 265 letters, from a total of 820 in existence, that focus on Van Gogh’s relentless quest to find his destiny, a search that led him to become an artist; the close bond with his brother Theo; his fraught relationship with his father; his innate yearning for recognition; and his great love of art and literature. The correspondence not only offers detailed insights into Van Gogh’s complex inner life, but also re-creates the world in which he lived and the artistic avant-garde that was taking hold in Paris.   The letters are accompanied by a general introduction, historic family photographs, and reproductions of 87 actual pages of letters that contain sketches by Van Gogh. Selected from the critically acclaimed 6-volume set of letters published by the Van Gogh Museum in 2009, Ever Yours is the essential book on Van Gogh’s letters, which every art and literature lover needs to own.  ",,,11/28/14,December 2nd 2014,[],Hardcover,,9780300209471,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407975283l/21945153.jpg,4.43,[],1157.0,12.0,,,,96.0,203.0,784,Yale University Press,"['126', '49', '20', '5', '3']",,[],,"['Vincent van Gogh', 'Leo Jansen', 'Hans Luijten', 'Nienke Bakker']"

Reigning for over fifty years, he achieved spectacular military triumphs and overcame grave threats to his authority, from parliamentary revolt to the Black Death. Revered by his subjects as a chivalric dynamo, he initiated the Hundred Years' War and gloriously led his men into battle against the Scots and the French.In this illuminating biography, W. Mark Ormrod takes a deeper look at Edward to reveal the man beneath the military muscle. What emerges is Edward's clear sense of his duty to rebuild the prestige of the Crown, and through military gains and shifting diplomacy, to secure a legacy for posterity. New details of the splendor of Edward's court, lavish national celebrations, and innovative use of imagery establish the king's instinctive understanding of the bond between ruler and people. With fresh emphasis on how Edward's rule was affected by his family relationships—including his roles as traumatized son, loving husband, and dutiful father—Ormrod gives a valuable new dimension to our understanding of this remarkable warrior king.",The English Monarchs,,08/26/11,January 24th 2012,['Edward III of England'],Hardcover,,9780300119107,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356352413l/11461997.jpg,4.26,[],100.0,1.0,,,,97.0,90.0,720,Yale University Press,"['42', '33', '12', '2', '1']",,[],,['W.

Bravery, loyalty, experience, and success lead to Maximus' appointment as ""General of the West"" by the Roman emperor, the ambition of a lifetime. But with the title comes a caveat: Maximus needs to muster and command a single legion to defend the perilous Rhine frontier. On the opposite side of the Rhine River, tribal nations are uniting; hundreds of thousands mass in preparation for the conquest of Gaul, and from there, a sweep down into Rome itself. Only a wide river and a wily general keep them in check.  With discipline, deception, persuasion, and surprise, Maximus holds the line against an increasingly desperate and innumerable foe. Friends, allies, and even enemies urge Maximus to proclaim himself emperor. He refuses, bound by an oath of duty, honor, and sacrifice to Rome, a city he has never seen. But then circumstance intervenes. Now, Maximus will accept the purple robe of emperor, if his scrappy legion can deliver this last crucial victory against insurmountable odds. The very fate of Rome hangs in the balance.

Die beiden Fhernhachen-Kinder Ensel und Krete erleben das am eigenen Leibe, als sie mit ihren Eltern den zamonischen Großen Wald bereisen. Dabei hatten sie gehofft, dort endlich einmal etwas zu erleben! Und so ziehen sie auf eigene Faust los, um das Abenteuer zu suchen, verlaufen sich jedoch nach kurzer Zeit. Damit nimmt ein rasantes Märchenabenteuer seinen Lauf, bei dem selbst den Gebrüdern Grimm bald die Puste ausgegangen wäre. Die beiden Zwergenkinder treffen auf zahlreiche gefährliche oder einfach nur sonderbare Geschöpef: einen Laubwolf, Erdgnömchen, Geheimbären, Fledertratten, Schuhus, Einhörnchen, einen sprechenden Meteor und allerlei andere Seltsamkeiten. Natürlich finden auch ein Hexenhaus, und der fantasievolle Showdown hat mehr mit dem Blair Witch Project als mit unseren alten Hausmärchen gemeinsam. Erzählt wird die Geschichte übrigens vom berüchtigsten Dichter Zamoniens, Hildegunst von Mythenmetz, einem tausend Jahre alten, aufrecht gehenden Zwergsaurier, der die Handlung -- meist an ihren spannendsten Stellen -- unterbricht, um weiterführende Erläuterungen zu geben, die sogar noch interessanter und witziger sind als die Handlung selbst. Diesem Stilmittel lieh der Dichter sogar seinen Namen: die ""Mythenmetzsche Abschweifung"". Und so erfährt man ganz nebenbei haarsträubende Details über zamonische Zahlensysteme, die sieben Grundtugenden des Dichters oder auch Insiderinformationen über den zamonischen Literaturbetrieb. Abgerundet wird das Buch durch die halbe Biografie des Hildegunst von Mythenmetz unter dem Titel ""Von der Lindwurmfeste zum Bloxberg"". Auf die Frage, wieso dieses Buch keine direkte Fortsetzung von Die 13 1/2 Leben des Käpt'n Blaubär sei, antwortete Walter Moers: ""Das hat verschiedene Gründe. Erstens glaube ich, dass ein Buch mit über 700 Seiten für eine Figur genügen sollte. Zweitens war für mich schon beim ersten Buch der eigentliche Held nicht der Blaubär, sondern der Kontinent Zamonien. Dessen Geschichte -- und die seiner Bewohner -- möchte ich weitererzählen, in alle möglichen Richtungen."" Und so besteht die Hoffnung, dass es auch weitere Zamonien-Bücher geben wird, selbst wenn Walter Moers die zweiten 13 1/2 Leben des Käpt'n Blaubär im Dunklen lässt. --Hardy Kettlitz",Zamonien #2,,06/28/00,July 3rd 2002,"['Ensel', 'Krete']",Paperback,,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170598805l/62035.jpg,3.72,[],94.0,1.0,,,,91.0,4034.0,256,Goldmann,"['884', '1528', '1270', '309', '43']",,['Zamonia'],,['Walter Moers']

"Early Film Noir: Greed, Lust and Murder Hollywood Style",,['Film'],"The name is French and it has connections to German expressionist cinema, but film noir was inspired by the American Raymond Chandler, whose prose was marked by the gripping realism of seedy hotels, dimly lit bars, main streets, country clubs, mansions, cul-de-sac apartments, corporate boardrooms, and flop houses of America. Chandler and the other writers and directors, including James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, Jane Greer, Ken Annakin, Rouben Mamoulian and Mike Mazurki, who were primarily responsible for the creation of the film noir genre and its common plots and themes, are the main focus of this work. It correlates the rise of film noir with the new appetites of the American public after World War II and explains how it was developed by smaller studios and filmmakers as a result of the emphasis on quality within a deliberately restricted element of cities at night. The author also discusses how RKO capitalized on films such as Murder, My Sweet and Out of the Past--two of film noir's most famous titles--and film noir's connection to British noir and the great international triumph of Sir Carol Reed in The Third Man.",,,08/05/03,August 18th 2003,[],Paperback,,9780786416295,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348510314l/389704.jpg,4.1,[],94.0,1.0,,,,85.0,20.0,211,McFarland & Company,"['11', '4', '2', '2', '1']",,[],,"['William Hare', 'Ken Annakin']"
