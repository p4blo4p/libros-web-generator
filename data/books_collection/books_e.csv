"E Lillian Volkmer, Rob Volkmer (Editor)",E Lillian Volkmer - Poet: The Early Years,,,,"When an artist views the world, he or she sees its potential on a canvass - size, perspective, colors, and shadows. When a composer creates, the music is already resounding mentally, placing the allegro, the adagio, deciding on moments of espirando. Mom's inspirations, whatever they happened to be, were immediately being put into words in her mind - and eventually, when time allowed, written down. Through the chapters of her life, she recorded her ""poet's"" view of those moments. We hope that you will look into her ""life"" as a poet through her youth, at times her broken heart, WWII with her husband at war, kids, loss of friends and family...and her lifelong love - Ken. This first volume – THE EARLY YEARS – includes her first poems at age 11 and continues through her early twenties to the time when she met her future husband, Ken. In this, you will see how her view of things may resonate more than you might expect. What she saw is what we all see, but for her to capture it in words, to enjoy over and over again, is the gift she gave to us.We are now sharing that gift with you.",,,,December 12th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,[],,B07LC242CQ,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544803367l/43233085._SY475_.jpg,5.0,[],99.0,1.0,,43233085-e-lillian-volkmer---poet,,,,,100.0,1.0,51,,,[],,,[],,

E. Michael Jones,Logos Rising: A History of Ultimate Reality,,English,,"There has never been a time when there was nothing, because if there were ever nothing, there could never be something. There has never been a time when there was nothing but chaos. Order cannot come from chaos, because that which is cannot come from that which is not. There has never been a time when man was not aware of an ultimate reality upon which he depended for his existence. The first name man gave to that ultimate reality was God. In every language and culture, God was a father who lived in the sky. But if God was a father, did he have a beard? If God was a father, did he have a wife? The first attempt to deduce the characteristics of God from the world man knew, ended up in the dead end known as mythology, whose best expression was Homer’s Iliad. At around the same time that Homer’s epic went from oral to written form, a group of Greeks in Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor abandoned mythology and began to look for some substance in nature as the basis for ultimate reality. Thales of Miletus said it was water. Anaxamines said it was air, and Heraclitus said it was fire, but fire was an expression of something more basic, and he claimed that the most basic principle of all was Logos. Five hundred years later, St. John the Evangelist brought this discussion full circle when he said that in the beginning there was Logos, and Logos was God. God, it turns out, was a father, but he didn’t have a beard or a wife. God was Logos. Logos wasn’t simply an abstract principle like geometry or physics, although it certainly was both of those things. Logos was a person who had the power to bring that plan into fulfillment over the course of human history. Time was no longer just the number of motion, as Aristotle claimed. Time was a drama with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It was like the Greek plays Aristotle described in his Poetics. And because we were creatures of Logos we could now understand that plan in the same way that the Greeks of Athens understood Oedipus Rex. The history of logos found its culmination in the logos of history. Logos is rising. Logos Rising: A History of Ultimate Reality describes the tragic and yet ultimately triumphant progress of Logos in human history, from the beginning of everything, to the emergence of the concept, to the Democratic primary of 2020.",,,,April 1st 2020,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'History', 'Catholic', 'Christianity']",,9780929891262,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586710011l/53144646._SX318_.jpg,4.77,[],97.0,1.0,,53144646-logos-rising,,,,,95.0,22.0,784,,Fidelity Press,"['20', '1', '0', '0', '1']",,,[],,

Stuart Little, the hero, is a mouse in the family of Frederick C. Little and is a debonair little character with a shy, engaging manner and a somewhat philosophical turn of mind. He is a great help around the house, and everybody except Snowbell the cat likes him a great deal. In spite of his small size, Stuart gets around in the world, riding a Fifth Avenue bus, racing (and winning in) a sailboat in Central Park, teaching school for a day, and so on. His size -- just over two inches -- does give him some trouble now and then, like the time he was rolled up in the window shade, or when he got dumped into a garbage scow. But on the whole his life is a happy one. His great adventure comes when, at the age of seven, he sets out in the world to seek his dearest friend, Margalo, a beautiful little bird who stayed for a few days in the Littles' Boston fern. It is on this search that we leave Stuart, going north in his little car, sure he is heading in the right direction.   In this special gift-book edition of a beloved classic, renowned artist Rosemary Wells has lovingly added delicate watercolor to the original black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams.

E.E. Doc Murdock (Goodreads Author),Crueltown: A Drew Steele Los Angeles-Las Vegas Mystery,,,,"LA detective, Drew Steele, takes on a new case while still recovering from life-threatening wounds he suffered in an IED explosion in Iraq where he was working for ""the company"" as a private contractor. The doctors told him he would never walk again, but he proved them wrong. After multiple surgeries, he is able to walk again using a high-tech prosthetic foot (which provides a convenient place to hide a tiny gun). Although he walks with a limp, don't call him a cripple; he's still one of the most successful and sought-after detectives in LA. His first case back in LA seems routine – a missing Las Vegas casino boss - and unrelated to what he was doing in Iraq, but the case turns decidedly dangerous when the missing man turns up dead with a strange message burned into the flesh of his forehead. When the autopsy reveals a grisly surprise in the dead man's stomach, Steele suspects it was put there to suggest the murder is somehow connected to drug trafficking in Crueltown, the criminal hideout in a toxic swamp near the LA-harbor where police are not allowed. But is Crueltown really at the center of this mystery, or is it one of his old enemies trying to draw him into a deadly trap?

E.E. Doc Murdock (Goodreads Author),A Psalm for Cock Robin: A Harp and His (Dead) Mother Mystery,,English,,"A Psalm for Cock Robin is the most innovative murder mystery you will ever read. It features a gentle young man named Harp who lives under the Santa Monica pier after he was accidentally released from a mental hospital. When he wakes up one morning to find another homeless man lying dead right next to him, he runs away but soon becomes the main suspect in the murder. Harp must find the killer before the police find him. Sound like a familiar murder mystery plot? Not really. Harp is clearly not much of a detective, but his caustic, sarcastic, Bible-quoting mother is. The only problem is she's dead. But when Harp gets into trouble, she comes into his head to guide him (and harass him) as he searches among a wild assortment of Venice Beach crazies for clues about who the murderer might be. She becomes a sort of second protagonist, always there in Harp's head to keep him on the straight and narrow (often by quoting the grimmest of Grimm's fairy tales, the only thing she let Harp read when he was a child). As weird as this book may sound, it's actually very funny. You'll find yourself laughing out loud, whether you want to or not.

The story follows him from his initial rear-echelon assignment in Saigon, where he falls for a mysterious storytelling bar girl, to his eventual posting at an isolated front-line firebase in one of the deepest parts of the Vietnam jungle. While recovering from a leg wound (he is hit by a piece of bone from a fellow soldier who stepped on a booby trap mine), he becomes the assistant medic and sees the horrors of war close up. The experience begins his steady spiral down into PTSD.

"E.J. Ruek (Goodreads Author), D.L. Keur",Old Hickory Lane,,English,,"Think ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" but with a plot, some mystery, and maybe a ghost. Set in a near future 'now' and marked by moment-to-moment, life-and-death crises that are a practicing veterinarian's life, meet Warren Jeffreys, DVM. Raised white, half Cree, he's gifted with animals, but not very people savvy. Struggling to survive his first year in private practice, despite the huge chip on his shoulder, college debt, and a plague of bigotry and prejudice, his bad luck and worse judgment lands him broke and homeless, camping out with vagrants and vagabonds. He's cleansing cows and cutting up dead lambs inside bawling ewes—an animal mechanic working for a small-time veterinary service in rural North Idaho. As his hopes for prestige and preeminence buckle under the rigors of day-to-day practice, he finds a new dream—a reconciliation to home and family—and with it comes a certain peace…until, once again, as fame and fortune tempt, he faces hard choices. Filled with intense, critical emergencies, all of them based on true cases, the book has been “vetted” by modern, practicing veterinarians. It's the animals that make you really pull for Dr. Warren Jeffreys, because, despite his best attempts not to, he cares. A lot. And, because he cares, because he competes against death, regardless the odds, he makes a difference. Unfortunately, the often cantankerous farm folk he serves don’t always appreciate his efforts and skill. Nor do they trust him, the ""too tall, long-haired Injun.""

E.J. Squires (Goodreads Author),Wraithsong,,English,,"Winner of the SILVER MEDAL in the 2014 Readers' Favorite annual International Award Contest—Category YA Paranormal Romance. Ever since she can remember, Sonia has had to abide by her parents' ridiculously unfair rules like not being allowed to date or even kiss a guy. The only reason she thinks she's being held to these rules is when Sonia was eight, she took a sip of her friend’s drink, causing her friend to do everything Sonia asked. As her eighteenth birthday approaches, Sonia is finally about to learn why; she's a Huldra, a dangerous, yet seductive and magical Norse forest maiden who with just one kiss, has the ability to control humans and appropriate parts of their souls. Keeping the rules hasn't been a problem for Sonia because she's never really been attracted to any guy. But when Anthony transfers to her school, every last rule flies out the window. There's just something about Anthony that she can't resist—the way he seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret that is connected to her, the way his mysterious blue eyes cause her heart to beat more rapidly, his athletic, god-like physique. The closer she gets to her eighteenth birthday—the moment she matures into a fully realized Huldra—the harder it becomes to follow her parents' rules. As graduation day approaches, Anthony starts to show interest in her, but she would never have guessed how life-changing and how dangerous Anthony's secrets are, and how overwhelmingly intense a relationship with him could be.

They live as recluses in their once grand Fifth Avenue mansion, scavenging the city streets for things they think they can use, hoarding the daily newspapers as research for Langley’s proposed dateless newspaper whose reportage will be as prophecy. Yet the epic events of the century play out in the lives of the two brothers – wars, political movements, technological advances – and even though they want nothing more than to shut out the world, history seems to pass through their cluttered house in the persons of immigrants, prostitutes, society women, government agents, gangsters, jazz musicians... and their housebound lives are fraught with odyssean peril as they struggle to survive and create meaning for themselves.

E.L. Konigsburg,A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver,,English,,"Eleanor of Aquitaine is in Heaven, waiting to learn whether or not her second husband, King Henry II of England, will be able to join her. Henry had died even before Eleanor, but he still had not won admission into Heaven. Waiting with Eleanor are Henry's mother, Matilda-Empress, and William the Marshal. A chance encounter with Abbot Suger, an old friend of Eleanor's from the time of her first marriage, starts the four of them remembering times past. Each person in turn tells a part of Eleanor's life, vividly illustrating the excitement of living in twelfth-century England and France, and especially the excitement of being Eleanor. Wife of two kings, mother of two others, Richard the Lion Heart and John, she set the tone of court life for her times, sponsored poets and musicians, established the legend of King Arthur as a romantic feature of English literature, set the Rules of Courtly Love, and helped rule a kingdom that spanned from Scotland to the Pyrenees. And she did all this in a time when a king could keep his queen a prisoner -- and did! This book is a novel, fiction, fantasy even.

How had she really chosen Noah and Nadia and Ethan and Julian? And why did they make such a good team? It was a surprise to a lot of people when Mrs. Olinski's team won the sixth-grade Academic Bowl contest at Epiphany Middle School. It was an even bigger surprise when they beat the seventh grade and the eighth grade, too. And when they went on to even greater victories, everyone began to ask: How did it happen?It happened at least partly because Noah had been the best man (quite by accident) at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather. It happened because Nadia discovered that she could not let a lot of baby turtles die. It happened when Ethan could not let Julian face disaster alone. And it happened because Julian valued something important in himself and saw in the other three something he also valued.Mrs. Olinski, returning to teaching after having been injured in an automobile accident, found that her Academic Bowl team became her answer to finding confidence and success. What she did not know, at least at first, was that her team knew more than she did the answer to why they had been chosen.This is a tale about a team, a class, a school, a series of contests and, set in the midst of this, four jewel-like short stories -- one for each of the team members -- that ask questions and demonstrate surprising answers.",,,09/01/96,May 1st 2003,['Noah Gershom'],Paperback,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Realistic Fiction', 'School', 'Juvenile', 'Contemporary', 'Classics', 'Read For School']",,9780689862212,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1476944774l/4538.jpg,3.75,"['Newbery Medal (1997)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award Nominee (1998)""]",817.0,9.0,,4538.The_View_from_Saturday,,,,,88.0,43586.0,176,,Aladdin Paperbacks,"['12519', '14916', '10824', '3521', '1806']",,,[],,

E.M.

Featuring fourteen short stories, The Life to Come spans six decades of E. M. Forster's literary career, tracking every phase of his development. Never having sought publication for most of the stories--only two were published in his lifetime--Forster worried his career would suffer because of their overtly homosexual themes. Instead they were shown to an appreciative circle of friends and fellow writers, including Christopher Isherwood, Siegfried Sassoon, Lytton Strachey, and T. E. Lawrence. With stories that are lively and amusing (""What Does It Matter?""; ""The Obelisk""), and others that are more somber and thought-provoking (""Dr Woolacott""; ""Arthur Snatchfold""), The Life to Come sheds a light on Forster's powerful but suppressed explorations beyond the strictures of conventional society. ""Have we been as ready for Forster's honesty as we thought we were? His greatness surely had root in his capacity to treat all human relationships seriously and truthfully. . . .

Forster, Oliver Stallybrass (Editor ), Pankaj Mishra (Introduction )",A Passage to India,,English,,"When Adela Quested and her elderly companion Mrs Moore arrive in the Indian town of Chandrapore, they quickly feel trapped by its insular and prejudiced 'Anglo-Indian' community. Determined to escape the parochial English enclave and explore the 'real India', they seek the guidance of the charming and mercurial Dr Aziz, a cultivated Indian Muslim. But a mysterious incident occurs while they are exploring the Marabar caves with Aziz, and the well-respected doctor soon finds himself at the centre of a scandal that rouses violent passions among both the British and their Indian subjects. A masterful portrait of a society in the grip of imperialism, A Passage to India compellingly depicts the fate of individuals caught between the great political and cultural conflicts of the modern world. In his introduction, Pankaj Mishra outlines Forster's complex engagement with Indian society and culture.

E.M. Hull,The Sheik,,English,,"Diana Mayo is young, beautiful, wealthy--and independent. Bored by the eligible bachelors and endless parties of the English aristocracy, she arranges for a horseback trek through the Algerian desert. Two days into her adventure, Diana is kidnapped by the powerful Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, who forces her into submission. Diana tries desperately to resist but finds herself falling in love with this dark and handsome stranger.Only when a rival chieftain steals Diana away does the Sheik realize that what he feels for her is more than mere passion. He has been conquered--and risks everything to get her back. The power of love reaches across the desert sands, leading to the thrilling and unexpected conclusion.One of the most widely read novels of the 1920s, and forever fixed in the popular imagination in the film version starring the irresistible Rudolph Valentino, The Sheik is recognized as the immediate precursor to the modern romance novel. When first published there was nothing like it: To readers the story was scandalous, exotic, and all-consuming; to such critics as the New York Times the book was ""shocking,"" although written with ""a high degree of literary skill."" In the author's native England, the bestselling book was labeled ""poisonously salacious"" by the Literary Review and banned from some communities. But the public kept reading.The influence of The Sheik on romance writers and readers continues to resonate. Despite controversy over its portrayal of sexual exploitation as a means to love, The Sheik remains a popular classic for its representation of the social order of its time, capturing contemporary attitudes toward colonialism as well as female power and independence that still strike a chord with readers today.",The Sheik Saga #1,,11/06/19,1923,"['Diana Mayo', 'Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan']",Hardcover,"['Romance', 'Classics', 'Historical Romance', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Adventure', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Algeria']",,9781406933765,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1302634754l/11093191.jpg,3.3,[],87.0,1.0,,11093191-the-sheik,,,,,72.0,1324.0,254,,George Newnes Ltd.,"['315', '307', '337', '194', '171']",,,['Algeria'],,

""Hoffmann was a follower of Cervantes and Sterne, a pioneering 'magic realist', fascinated by Gothic horror, extreme mental states and supernatural events occurring within sharply (and sometimes satirically) rendered social settings. A talented composer and painter, he portrayed himself in the guise of Johannes Kreisler - the hypochondriac, antisocial and moody but brilliant musician. In this astonishing book, a vain and very bourgeois tomcat sets out to write his memoirs, using a biography of Kreisler as a blotting pad. By a printer's error, the two lives get spliced together into a bizarre double narrative.

"E.W. Hornung, Richard Lancelyn Green (Editor)",Raffles: The Amateur Cracksman,,English,,"Gentleman thief Raffles is daring, debonair, devilishly handsome-and a first-rate cricketer. In these eight stories, the master burglar indulges his passion for cricket and crime: stealing jewels from a country house, outwitting the law, pilfering from the nouveau riche, and, of course, bowling like a demon-all with the assistance of his plucky sidekick, Bunny. Encouraged by his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle, to write a series about a public school villain, and influenced by his own experiences at Uppingham, E. W. Hornung created a unique form of crime story, where, in stealing as in sport, it is playing the game that counts, and there is always honor among thieves.","A.J.

East Bay Municipal Utility District (Calif.),Plants And Landscapes For Summer-dry Climates Of The San Francisco Bay Region,,,Gardening,"Gardening. Environmental Studies. Photographs by Saxon Holt. Illustrations by Richard Pembroke. This lavishly illustrated book celebrates the challenges and opportunities of gardening in Mediterranean climates, with special reference to northern California's San Francisco Bay Region. The core of the book is a catalog of more than 650 plants suited to regions with mild, usually wet winters and dry, often hot summers. These plants thrive with moderate to no summer irrigation when established, require little or no maintenance, and are reasonably available from nurseries, botanic gardens, native plant sales, or specialty seed suppliers. Many of the 542 color photographs show plants in garden settings to suggest attractive and compatible plant combinations. Summary charts provide information on each plant, such as bloom time, needs for water and sun, and preferences for coastal or inland microclimates. Lists suggest plants for special situations, such as hot sites, dryish shade, small gardens, and clay soils. Chapters on landscape design and maintenance inspire readers to make gardens that use little water and no harmful chemicals, with a focus on building healthy soil. Practical steps to successful design are supplemented with ideas for designing with microclimate, attracting wildlife, and fire safety. Sidebars by local experts discuss weather, natural landscapes, design solutions, and gardening with recycled water. ""A valuable resource for climate-compatible gardening in the San Franciso Bay Area that will also be of interest to gardeners in other parts of the world with a similar seasonal pattern of winter rain and dry summers. This book will occupy a prominent place in my library for many years to come.""—Katherine Greenberg, president Mediterranean Garden Society ""This book is beautifully designed with abundant photographs of plants, many in garden settings, and it is packed with the kind of information gardeners need for their own special situations.

Eben Alexander,Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife,,English,,"Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander’s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion—and in essence makes us human—shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander’s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander’s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.Alexander’s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. Today Alexander is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

This book extracts the essence from his teachings in The Power of Now, showing us how to free ourselves from “enslavement to the mind.” The aim is to be able to enter into and sustain an awakened state of consciousness throughout everyday life. Through meditations and simple techniques, Eckhart shows us how to quiet our thoughts, see the world in the present moment, and find a path to “a life of grace, ease, and lightness.”",,,10/28/99,September 25th 2001,[],Hardcover,"['Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'New Age', 'Inspirational']",,9781577311959,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388178295l/6709.jpg,4.25,[],315.0,4.0,,6709.Practicing_the_Power_of_Now,,,,,94.0,38220.0,128,,New World Library,"['19890', '10766', '5385', '1453', '726']",,,[],,
Eckhart Tolle,The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,,English,,"Eckhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly ""living in the now"" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into The Power of Now. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise ""break time"". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, The Power of Now reads like the highly acclaimed A Course in Miracles--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --Gail Hudson",,,10/28/97,August 19th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'Inspirational', 'Unfinished']",,9781577314806,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925535l/6708.jpg,4.13,[],4178.0,52.0,,6708.The_Power_of_Now,,,,,91.0,210620.0,229,,New World Library,"['101981', '59268', '31429', '11172', '6770']",,,[],,
Eckhart Tolle,Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat with Eckhart Tolle,,English,,"Perhaps you can recall a time when you felt more alive than at any other moment—when you had a sudden recognition of beauty, a feeling of deep contentment, and a sense of connection with life greater than you had ever thought possible. And then, this fleeting moment was gone. What if you could recapture that remarkable opening, and make it a consistent way of living in the world?Course objectives:Practice using your inner body as an anchor to the ""Now""—realizing the gift of full attention, and cultivating moments of pure awareness through the simple act of noticing.• Discuss the authentic grace, original innocence, the liberation of laughter, and nature as a bridge to the divine—available to us all.• Define ""awakening"", discover how to dissolve your pain-body with the light of consciousness and why creativity and healing can come only from presence.• Explain why ""the teacher"" is always within you and how to enter the ""Now"" through the portal called ""allow.""• Describe how to find peace that underlies loss.• Summarize how to catch your reactive thoughts before they catch you, and how to expand the space between your thoughts for a deeper experience of the ""Now.""Throughout Europe and North America, a man named Eckhart Tolle has emerged as a teacher with the unique ability to draw us into the awakened state he calls presence. With Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat with Eckhart Tolle, you have an unparalleled opportunity to immerse yourself in the timeless dimension—a place within us that always is and ever will be beyond the turmoil of life, a world of calm beyond words, of joy that has no opposite.Return to Presence Again and AgainA walk in nature. A personal crisis. A moment of laughter. These can all serve as portals that take us to the depth and wonder of the Now. But how do we access these portals so that we dwell in presence more and more often? With Tolle's guidance, you will discover many simple ways to leave behind the chaos and suffering of the mind-made world, and enter this state of serenity and grace.On Realizing the Power of Now, Eckhart will show you how to go beyond the endless stream of thoughts, and simply allow whatever is happening to occur; how to use sense perceptions and your inner body to find a peace that exists independent of conditions; and how to see past the ""little me"" and my story, and find your home in the living Now.An Extended Retreat with Eckhart TolleSince the spiritual transformation that changed his life more than 20 years ago, Eckhart Tolle has replaced the park bench where he gave his first lessons with a chair and microphone, and now helps countless men and women from all walks of life to perceive what it really means to be alive.Recorded at a momentous five-day retreat led by Eckhart Tolle, here is a special invitation to transcend the finite world of fluctuating thoughts, ambitions, and fears, and touch your true essence: that which has no form, no time, and no name. Spoken simply, with his hallmark warmth, humor, and compassion, here is Eckhart's full presentation of a beautiful way to live that arises through Realizing the Power of Now.Realizing the Power of Now highlights:Using your inner body as an anchor to the Now• The gift of full attention• Cultivating moments of pure awareness• The power in the simple act of noticing• Authentic grace and the original innocence we all possess• The liberation of laughter• How to expand the space between your thoughts for a deeper experience of the Now• Nature as a bridge to the divine• Why the teacher is always within you• Reactive thoughts how to catch them before they catch you• Definition of awakening• Entering the Now through the portal called ""allow""• Why creativity and healing can come only from presence• Dissolving your pain-body with the light of consciousness• How to find the peace that underlies loss• Separating your life situation from your life• More than seven hours of personal guidance with the author of The Power of Now",,,,April 1st 2003,[],Audio CD,"['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Religion', 'Inspirational']",,9781591790716,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925516l/6716.jpg,4.14,[],96.0,1.0,,6716.Realizing_the_Power_of_Now,,,,,92.0,953.0,6,,Sounds True,"['468', '266', '139', '47', '33']",,,[],,

"Ed Catmull, Amy Wallace","Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration",,English,,"“What does it mean to manage well?”From Ed Catmull, co-founder (with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter) of Pixar Animation Studios, comes an incisive book about creativity in business—sure to appeal to readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath. Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.   As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:   • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.  • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.  • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody. • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.",,,07/24/09,April 8th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Management', 'Biography', 'Design', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship']",,9780812993011,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400863577l/18077903.jpg,4.21,"['Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Nominee for Shortlist (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Business Books (2014)']",283.0,3.0,,18077903-creativity-inc,,,,,94.0,64912.0,368,,Random House,"['31429', '21143', '8443', '2279', '1618']",,,[],,

The hanging death of a nondescript old man in a shabby little apartment in a meager section of the 87th Precinct is nothing much in this city, especially to detectives Carella and Meyer. But everyone has a story, and this old man's story stood to make some people a lot of money. His story takes Carella, Meyer, Brown, and Weeks on a search through Isola's seedy strip clubs and to the bright lights of the theater district.

More in-depth T Theory is available in TT's 5 book cosmology series, via Amazon in Paperbacks and as EBooks. (Also inquire at Chapters book stores. See Ed's website: www.trillionist.comPlease note that many TT ideas may be very alien when you firstencounter them. For, 'Most great ideas were initially viewed asridiculous.' Read TT in full to grasp how the neo concepts addedtogether make sense.T Theory predicts, 'TT's new theories are simply ahead of theirtime. Astronomers/astrophysicists, are presently slowly movingtowards discovering the secrets which T Theory writes about.Slowly, because their belief in the Big Bang halts their progress.That is the reason why T Theory is now reaching out to theseexperts; to speed up their cosmic discoveries as indicated by TT.' 'How our cosmos shows itself to us is a direct result of how itwas contructed; not accidentally by a Big Bang, but rather fromthe deployment of black holes that worked long and hard to build all of the cosmic spheres and then organize and control the spheres into billions of solar systems inside of millions of galaxies.' The Trillion Theory (TT) book series (5 books), by self-made cosmology writer Ed Lukowich, is the story of how our cosmos incredibly grew from small beginnings a trillion years ago to 73 quintillion stars today. See website www.trillionist.comSpinning Black Hole Inside Our Earth, provides (in brief)new eye-opening answers to 4 great universe questions: -How did our Earth form into a sphere? -How did our Solar System get its formation? -How did our Milky Way Galaxy become a hotel hosting millions of solar systems, such as ours?-How did our cosmos evolve to its gigantic size? Ed's answers to these 4 secrets shows that a specific type ofscientific design was used throughout the project of building ourcosmos; a design feature seen within atoms, planets, solar systems, and within the billions of galaxies. The notion of cosmic design doesset off a firestorm with many people. (Note: Detailed expandedanswers can be found in Ed's 4 previous cosmology books.

Though most of the poems in this collection do not necessarily take place in Pittsburgh, there is a rhythmic fragmentation here painting portraits of urban life in general.

Ed Sanders,The Family,,English,,"In August of 1969, during two bloody evenings of paranoid, psychedelic savagery, Charles Manson and his dystopic communal family helped to wreck the dreams of the Love Generation. At least nine people were murdered, among them Sharon Tate, the young, beautiful, pregnant, actress and wife of Roman Polanski. Ed Sanders' unnerving and detailed look at the horror dealt by Manson and his followers is a classic of the true-crime genre. The Family was originally published in 1971 and remains the most meticulously researched account of the most notorious murders of the 1960s. Using firsthand accounts from some of the family's infamous members, including the wizard himself, Sanders examines not only the origins and legacy of Manson and his family, but also the mysteries that persist.

"Ed Viesturs, David Roberts",No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks,,English,,"This gripping and triumphant memoir follows a living legend of extreme mountaineering as he makes his assault on history, one 8,000-meter summit at a time.For eighteen years Ed Viesturs pursued climbing’s holy grail: to stand atop the world’s fourteen 8,000-meter peaks, without the aid of bottled oxygen. But No Shortcuts to the Top is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, “Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.” It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs’s odyssey, No Shortcuts to the Top is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.",,,01/01/06,October 17th 2006,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Mountaineering', 'Adventure', 'Biography', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Climbing', 'Outdoors', 'Sports', 'Biography Memoir']",,9780767924702,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320414477l/154924.jpg,4.09,[],95.0,1.0,,154924.No_Shortcuts_to_the_Top,,,,,96.0,9055.0,368,,Broadway Books,"['3349', '3663', '1678', '273', '92']",,,[],,
"Ed Viesturs, David Roberts",K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain,,English,,"A thrilling chronicle of the tragedy-ridden history of climbing K2, the world's most difficult and unpredictable mountain, by the bestselling authors of No Shortcuts to the TopAt 28,251 feet, the world's second-tallest mountain, K2 thrusts skyward out of the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan. Climbers regard it as the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, with good reason. Four times as deadly as Everest, K2 has claimed the lives of seventy-seven climbers since 1954. In August 2008 eleven climbers died in a single thirty-six-hour period on K2–the worst single-event tragedy in the mountain's history and the second-worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Yet summiting K2 remains a cherished goal for climbers from all over the globe. Before he faced the challenge of K2 himself, Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, thought of it as ""the holy grail of mountaineering.""In K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain, Viesturs explores the remarkable history of the mountain and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time he probes K2's most memorable sagas in an attempt to illustrate the lessons learned by confronting the fundamental questions raised by mountaineering–questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and were nearly killed in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death. Fortunately, Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott' s.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs and Roberts crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit.",,,10/30/09,October 13th 2009,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Mountaineering', 'Adventure', 'Travel', 'Climbing', 'Sports', 'History', 'Biography', 'Outdoors', 'Memoir']",,9780767932509,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320393028l/6309380.jpg,3.98,[],98.0,1.0,,6309380-k2,,,,,96.0,5145.0,342,,Crown Archetype,"['1564', '2164', '1197', '176', '44']",,,[],,

Ed Yong,I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life,,English,,"Every animal, whether human, squid, or wasp, is home to millions of bacteria and other microbes. Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. In this astonishing book, Ed Yong takes us on a grand tour through our microbial partners, and introduces us to the scientists on the front lines of discovery. Yong, whose humor is as evident as his erudition, prompts us to look at ourselves and our animal companions in a new light—less as individuals and more as the interconnected, interdependent multitudes we assuredly are. The microbes in our bodies are part of our immune systems and protect us from disease. Those in cows and termites digest the plants they eat. In the deep oceans, mysterious creatures without mouths or guts depend on microbes for all their energy. Bacteria provide squids with invisibility cloaks, help beetles to bring down forests, and allow worms to cause diseases that afflict millions of people. I Contain Multitudes is the story of these extraordinary partnerships, between the creatures we are familiar with and those we are not. It reveals how we humans are disrupting these partnerships and how we might manipulate them for our own good. It will change both our view of nature and our sense of where we belong in it.",,,,August 9th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Health', 'Audiobook', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Popular Science', 'Medical', 'Evolution']",,9780062368591,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445606162l/27213168.jpg,4.15,"['Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee (2017)', 'Los Angeles Times Book Prize Nominee for Science & Technology (2016)', 'Wellcome Book Prize Nominee (2017)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science & Technology (2016)']",15.0,1.0,,27213168-i-contain-multitudes,,,,,95.0,15586.0,368,,Ecco,"['6319', '6254', '2287', '478', '248']",,,[],,

Taip pasakė mano mama, iš mūsų išgirdusi žinią, kad planuojame naują knygos „Galutinė stotis – Aušvicas"" leidimą. Ji buvo teisi. Aušvicas gyveno su mumis. Dažniausiai jis buvo matomas, vis išnyrantis tėvo pasakojimuose ir sugrįžtantis jo, kaip psichiatro, profesinėje veikloje. Arba jis būdavo plika akimi nematomas, bet lyg vaiduoklis blaškydavosi po mūsų namus, keldamas baimę.Aušvicas neturi pasikartoti – šis troškimas, atsiradęs tėvo širdyje, vokiečiams palikus lagerį, tapo varomąja jo gyvenimo jėga, savo istoriją paskatinusia ant popieriaus užrašyti. Dėl šios priežasties „Galutinė stotis – Aušvicas"" yra daugiau nei asmeninis liudijimas: tai žvilgsnis į siaubo pasaulį, iki šiolei daugeliui mūsų nematytą ir nepažintą.„Tai, kad, minint 75 metų Aušvico išlaisvinimo sukaktį ir praėjus daugiau nei 30 metų po tėvo mirties, ši knyga įgauna pripažinimą, kokio verta, ir tai, kad mano tėvo balsas vėl skamba viešumoje, yra reikšmingas įvykis.""Melcheris de Windas, Eddy de Windo sūnusEddy de Windas (1916–1987) – paskutinis žydas gydytojas, baigęs Leideno universitetą Olandijoje per Antrąjį pasaulinį karą.

Vesterborke jis susipažino su pirmąja žmona Friedele, ten jiedu ir susituokė. 1943 m. porą deportavo į Aušvicą. 1944 metų pabaigoje, rusams artėjant prie stovyklos, vokiečiai ėmė sprukti, drauge išsivarydami dar galinčius paeiti kalinius. 1945 metų sausio mėnesį į žygį buvo išvaryta ir Friedelė.

His street fight stabbing follows the deaths of Jonas, Summer and Arizona in equally strange and sudden circumstances. Rumours of ghosts and strange happenings rip through the small community as it comes to terms with shock and loss. Marina, Phoenix's grief-stricken girlfriend, is on the verge. She can't escape her intense heartache, or the impossible apparitions of those that are meant to be dead. And all the while the sound of beating wings echo inside her head! And then one day Phoenix appears to Darina. Ecstatic to be reunited, he tells her about the Beautiful Dead. Souls in limbo, they have been chosen to return to the world to set right a wrong linked to their deaths and bring about justice. Beautiful, superhuman and powerful, they are marked by a 'death mark' - a small tattoo of angel's wings. Phoenix tells her that the sound of invisible wings beating are the millions of souls in limbo, desperate to return to earth.Darina's mission is clear: she must help Jonas, Summer, Arizona, and impossibly, her beloved Phoenix, right the wrong linked to their deaths to set them free from limbo so that they can finally rest in peace.

Everyday teen existence meets indigenous beliefs, crazy family dynamics, and cannibalistic river otter . . . The exciting first novel in her trickster trilogy.Everyone knows a guy like Jared: the burnout kid in high school who sells weed cookies and has a scary mom who's often wasted and wielding some kind of weapon. Jared does smoke and drink too much, and he does make the best cookies in town, and his mom is a mess, but he's also a kid who has an immense capacity for compassion and an impulse to watch over people more than twice his age, and he can't rely on anyone for consistent love and support, except for his flatulent pit bull, Baby Killer (he calls her Baby)--and now she's dead. Jared can't count on his mom to stay sober and stick around to take care of him. He can't rely on his dad to pay the bills and support his new wife and step-daughter. Jared is only sixteen but feels like he is the one who must stabilize his family's life, even look out for his elderly neighbours. But he struggles to keep everything afloat...and sometimes he blacks out. And he puzzles over why his maternal grandmother has never liked him, why she says he's the son of a trickster, that he isn't human. Mind you, ravens speak to him--even when he's not stoned.

Eden Robinson,Monkey Beach,,English,,"Five hundred miles north of Vancouver is Kitamaat, an Indian reservation in the homeland of the Haisla people. Growing up a tough, wild tomboy, swimming, fighting, and fishing in a remote village where the land slips into the green ocean on the edge of the world, Lisamarie has always been different. Visited by ghosts and shapeshifters, tormented by premonitions, she can't escape the sense that something terrible is waiting for her. She recounts her enchanted yet scarred life as she journeys in her speedboat up the frigid waters of the Douglas Channel. She is searching for her brother, dead by drowning, and in her own way running as fast as she can toward danger. Circling her brother's tragic death are the remarkable characters that make up her family: Lisamarie's parents, struggling to join their Haisla heritage with Western ways; Uncle Mick, a Native rights activist and devoted Elvis fan; and the headstrong Ma-ma-oo (Haisla for ""grandmother""), a guardian of tradition. Haunting, funny, and vividly poignant, Monkey Beach gives full scope to Robinson's startling ability to make bedfellows of comedy and the dark underside of life.

Edgar Allan Poe,Complete Poems,,,Poetry,"Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is internationally renowned as a pioneering master of the macabre. He is regarded as one of the world's great short story writers as well as a great lyric poet, and is credited with inventing the detective story and the modern gothic horror tale. He has been an important influence on many major American and European writers including William Faulkner, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Baudelaire, H.P. Lovecraft, and William Butler Yeats, among many others. Poe's poetry, which is collected in this volume, is more personal than his prose. The themes of love, death, and despair which recur throughout reflect the anguish he suffered in his own troubled life. ""Annabel Lee"" is a haunting lament to his young wife, Virginia, who died of tuberculosis. ""The Bells"" is an eerie and melancholy meditation which recreates with brilliant musical language the hypnotic, funereal aura of ringing bells. ""The Raven"" is a comic tour de force in which the protagonist turns his strange visitor into a symbol of his own sorrow and loss. Poe's best poems remain some of the most popular and technically accomplished in the English language.

Edgar Allan Poe,Complete Poems (Library of Classic Poets),,English,,"Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is internationally renowned as a pioneering master of the macabre. He is regarded as one of the world's great short story writers as well as a great lyric poet, and is credited with inventing the detective story and the modern gothic horror tale. He has been an important influence on many major American and European writers including William Faulkner, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Baudelaire, H.P. Lovecraft, and William Butler Yeats, among many others.Poe's poetry, which is collected in this volume, is more personal than his prose. The themes of love, death, and despair which recur throughout reflect the anguish he suffered in his own troubled life. ""Annabel Lee"" is a haunting lament to his young wife, Virginia, who died of tuberculosis. ""The Bells"" is an eerie and melancholy meditation which recreates with brilliant musical language the hypnotic, funereal aura of ringing bells. ""The Raven"" is a comic tour de force in which the protagonist turns his strange visitor into a symbol of his own sorrow and loss.

Edgar Allan Poe,The Purloined Letter,,English,,"Dans cette nouvelle, le détective Auguste Dupin est informé par G..., le préfet de police de Paris, qu'une lettre de la plus haute importance a été volée dans le boudoir royal. Le moment précis du vol et le voleur, D..., sont connus du policier, mais celui-ci est dans l'incapacité d'accabler le coupable. Malgré des fouilles extrêmement minutieuses effectuées au domicile du voleur, G... n'a en effet pas pu retrouver la lettre. Mettre la main sur cette dernière est pourtant d'une grande importance, car son possesseur se retrouve en mesure d'exercer des pressions sur le membre de la famille royale à qui il l'a dérobée. G... en vient donc à demander l'aide de Dupin. Quelques semaines plus tard, Dupin restitue la lettre au préfet. Il explique alors au narrateur comment certains principes simples lui ont permis de retrouver la lettre.Comme dans Double assassinat dans la rue Morgue, La Lettre volée met en scène Dupin et ses célèbres facultés d'analyse. La réflexion logique est au centre de la nouvelle, et toute une part de l'intrigue s'appuie sur les difficultés à trouver une solution rationnelle à la disparition de la lettre. Lors de sa visite à Dupin, G... explique les raisonnements qui lui ont permis de découvrir l'identité du voleur, D..., et ceux qui lui ont permis de déduire que la lettre était toujours en sa possession, cachée quelque part dans son domicile. En dépit de ses certitudes, G... ne parvient pourtant pas à récupérer l'objet : le mystère se partage donc entre d'une part la possession certaine d'éléments, et de l'autre l'incapacité à obtenir des résultats.Si Dupin réussit, lui, à résoudre cette apparente contradiction, c'est parce qu'il a su raisonner autrement que le policier, dont les déductions, pour justes qu'elles fussent, n'ont pas suffi à résoudre l'affaire. G... a en vain cherché la lettre en la supposant cachée : il a sondé tous les espaces pouvant abriter une lettre qu'on aurait voulu dissimuler. Dupin comprend lui que si G.. a échoué, c'est que la lettre volée a volontairement été mise en évidence par le criminel. Loin d'être rangé dans un endroit secret, le billet est en évidence dans le bureau du coupable : la lettre a été froissée, maquillée d'un autre sceau et d'une autre écriture après avoir été pliée à l'envers.

Edgar Allan Poe,The Man of the Crowd,,,,"The Man of the Crowd"" is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe about a nameless narrator following a man through a crowded London, first published in 1840. The story is introduced with the epigraph, ""Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir etre seul""-a quote taken from The Characters of Man by Jean de la Bruyere. It translates to This great misfortune, of not being able to be alone. This same quote is used in Poe's earliest tale, ""Metzengerstein."" Illustration by Harry Clarke for a London edition dated 1923 After an unnamed illness, the unnamed narrator sits in an unnamed coffee shop in London. Fascinated by the crowd outside the window, he considers how isolated people think they are, despite ""the very denseness of the company around."" He takes time to categorize the different types of people he sees. As evening falls, the narrator focuses on ""a decrepit old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,"" whose face has a peculiar idiosyncrasy, and whose body ""was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble"" wearing filthy, ragged clothes of a ""beautiful texture."" The narrator dashes out of the coffee shop to follow the man from afar. The man leads the narrator through bazaars and shops, buying nothing, and into a poorer part of the city, then back into ""the heart of the mighty London."" This chase lasts through the evening and into the next day. Finally, exhausted, the narrator stands in front of the man, who still does not notice him. The narrator concludes the man is ""the type and genius of deep crime"" due to his inscrutability and inability to leave the crowds of London. Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 - October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Born in Boston, he was the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia. Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to ""a Bostonian."" With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan.",,,06/01/94,July 11th 2014,[],Paperback,"['Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'American', 'Mystery', 'Gothic', 'The United States Of America', 'Literature', 'College']",,9781500495497,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406509219l/22806018.jpg,3.42,[],98.0,1.0,,22806018-the-man-of-the-crowd,,,,,83.0,1222.0,26,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,"['191', '379', '441', '173', '38']",,,[],,

Creator of the modern detective story, innovative architect of the horror genre, and a poet of extraordinary musicality, Edgar Allan Poe remains one of America's most popular and influential writers. His tales and poems brim with psychological depth, almost painful intensity, and unexpected—and surprisingly modern—flashes of dark humor and irony.This anthology offers an exceptionally generous selection of Poe's short stories. It includes his famed masterpieces, such as ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" and ""The Purloined Letter,"" featuring Poe's great detective, Dupin; his insightful studies of madness ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart""; ""The Gold-Bug,"" his delightful exercise in ""code-breaking""; and important but lesser-known tales, such as ""Bon-Bon,"" ""The Assignation,"" and ""King Pest."" Also included are some of Poe's most beloved poems, haunting lyrics of love and loss, such as ""Annabel Lee,"" nightmare phantasmagories such as ""The Raven,"" and his grand experiment in translating sound into words, ""The Bells.""Benjamin F. Fisher, Professor of English, University of Mississippi, is a longtime enthusiast of the works of Poe.

Auguste Dupin. Introducing to literature the concept of applying reason to solving crime, these tales brought Poe fame and fortune. Years later, Dorothy Sayers would describe “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” as “almost a complete manual of detective theory and practice.” Indeed, Poe’s short mysteries inspired the creation of countless literary sleuths, among them Sherlock Holmes.

Their somber poetry and rich moods of menace and melancholy have conjured some of the most haunting images in American literature: the accusing echo of the tell-tale heart, the beloved but doomed Annabel Lee, the gloom-shrouded House of Usher, the maddening tortures of the pit and pendulum, the eerie and enigmatic Raven.Dramatic and irreversible, Poe's work invites us to match our darkest imaginings to his vision of the world colored by grief and madness and haunted by specters of guilt and death. This illustrated edition captures Poe's best-known works in all their shadowy splendor through the incomparable art of Mark Summers. His striking full-page color illustrations and ghostly black-and-white pencil sketches reveal the skull beneath the skin of Poe's obsessed and mournful characters and subtly express their heart of emotional darkness that gives them life and purpose.The book also features and introduction by best-selling fantasist and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman, who discusses his personal relationship with Poe's writing and its enduring impact. ""Poe"", he writes, ""for all his short life and unfulfilled potential, remains as much read today, his finest stories as successful, as readable, as contemporary as anyone can desire.""

"Edgar Rice Burroughs, Aaron Parrett (Introduction)",The Martian Tales Trilogy,,English,,"When it rains in a Burroughs novel, the reader gets wet."" -- Science-fiction writer Jack McDevittCombining otherworldly adventures with elements of classical myth, fast-paced plots with cliffhanging tension, and imaginative fantasy with vivid prose, Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Martian Tales Trilogy helped define a new literary genre emerging in the early twentieth century that would become known as science fiction.Hero John Carter proves himself against deadly foes in The Martian Trilogy. In the first installment, Carter wins the affections of the ""princess of Mars"" and the respect of the Martian warlords whom he befriends. The excitement continues in The Gods of Mars when Carter engages the Black Pirates in airborne combat above the dead seas of Mars and leads a revolt to free the Martian races from a religion that thrives on living sacrifices. In the third book, Warlord of Mars, Carter overcomes the forces of evil that would destroy the planet. By the end of the trilogy the Martians all clamor for a triumphant John Carter to be their king.About the Author:Born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 1, 1875, Edgar Rice Burroughs grew to maturity during the height of the Industrial Revolution and witnessed the emergence of the United States as a twentieth-century world power. Hailing from a well-to-do family, Burroughs was given an aristocratic education steeped in Latin and Greek, but he was drawn more to an itinerant life of adventure than to a life in the boardroom. The author of Tarzan of the Apes (1912), Burroughs did not confine himself to a single genre; he also wrote medieval romances (The Outlaw of Torn, 1914), westerns (The War Chief of the Apaches, 1927), and mainstream novels (The Girl from Hollywood, 1922).",Barsoom #1-3,,05/30/03,July 22nd 2004,[],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Classics', 'Adventure', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Unfinished', 'Pulp', 'Sword and Planet', 'Speculative Fiction']",,9780760755853,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388884655l/668851.jpg,4.01,[],137.0,2.0,,668851.The_Martian_Tales_Trilogy,,,,,94.0,2510.0,617,,Barnes Noble,"['884', '942', '533', '119', '32']",,,[],,

Later she takes her flier into a storm and loses control of the craft, and the storm carries her to an unfamiliar region of Barsoom. After landing and fleeing from a pack of ferocious Banths (Martian lions), she is captured by the horrific Kaldanes, who resemble large heads with small, crab-like legs. The Kaldanes have bred a symbiotic race of headless human-like creatures called Rykors, which they can attach themselves to and ride like a horse. While imprisoned, Tara manages to win over one of the Kaldanes, Ghek, with her lovely singing voice.Fifth of his Barsoom series. Burroughs began writing it in January, 1921, and the finished story was first published in Argosy All-Story Weekly as a six-part serial in the issues for February 18 and 25 and March 4, 11, 18 and 25, 1922. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in November 1922.  ""A daughter,"" he replied, ""only a little younger than Carthoris, and, barring one, the fairest thing that ever breathed the thin air of dying Mars.

Edith Pargeter,The Heaven Tree Trilogy,,English,,"A trilogy of novels set in twelfth-century England and Wales--The Heaven Tree, The Green Branch, and The Scarlet Seed--chronicles the adventures of master stone carver Harry Talvace; Ralf Isambard, Lord of Parfois; and their two sons.Set on the volatile, hotly disputed Welsh border, this full-bodied, swift-moving story of deadly politics, clashing armies, and private passions sweeps the reader into its characters' grand quest for justice and vengeance. The trilogy focuses on Harry Talvace, who bears stamped on his face the lineage of Shrewsbury's Norman conquerors. Born to aristocratic parents and nursed by a stone mason's wife, he grows up fiercely loyal to his breast-brother, the sunny, irresistibly charming Adam. Harry also discovers that he has a gift--the ability to carve stone with the sure hand of genius.In his fifteenth year, Harry's devotion to Adam and his obsession to sculpt set into motion the thrilling tale of Volume One, The Heaven Tree. Rebelling against his father and fleeing England to save Adam, Harry finds his destiny entangled in the affairs of commoners and kings, divided by two women--the courageous dark-haired Gilleis and the beautiful courtesan Benedetta--and pledged to the brooding, mysterious Lord of Parfois, Ralf Isambard, who sponsors Harry's monumental creation of a cathedral. And while Wales and France challenge England's crown, these men and women follow their desires toward jealousy, pitiless revenge, and passion so madly glorious neither time nor a merciless execution can end it. In Volume Two, The Green Branch, Harry's son, young Harry Talvace, is drawn into the fabulous intrigues of the court of Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales, and bound by a blood oath to find and kill his father's old enemy, Isambard. Yet the threads that bind his life to the ruthless Isambard are not so easily severed, as Harry falls under the spell of the aging warrior lord.The concluding volume, The Scarlet Seed, brings full circle this tale of implacable enmity and unshakeable loyalty. As a kingdom shudders under the flames of civil war and captor becomes captive, the final siege of Parfois creates a climax to this tale so majestic, noble, and heartbreaking no reader will ever forget it.",Heaven Tree #1-3,,10/28/60,October 1st 1993,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'British Literature', '12th Century', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Female Authors']",,9780446517089,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298506500l/321544.jpg,4.31,[],321.0,4.0,,321544.The_Heaven_Tree_Trilogy,,,,,94.0,991.0,899,,Warner Books (NY),"['561', '261', '111', '33', '25']",,,[],,

Edith Templeton,Gordon,,English,,"Originally written under a pseudonym, this thrilling novel of passion in post-World War II London was banned upon its publication in the late 1960s, and is only now being republished under the author's real name. Edith Templeton creates an indelible character in the smartly dressed Louisa, a savvy young woman in the midst of a divorce who meets a charismatic man in a pub and within an hour has been sexually conquered by him on a garden bench. Thus begins her baffling but magnetic love affair with, and virtual enslavement to, Richard Gordon.Gordon, a psychiatrist, keeps Louisa in his thrall with his almost omniscient ability to see through her and she, in turn, is gripped by the deep, unexpected pleasure of complete submission. As they venture further and further into the depths -- both psychological and sexual -- she begins, for the first time, to understand her troubled history and the self that has emerged from it.In her clean, precise style, with every social nuance and motive exquisitely observed, Templeton delivers a tightly wound drama, unsparingly forthright in its description of how this form of love can bring incomparable rapture.

Edmund Chan,Cultivating Your Inner Life,,,,"Cultivating Your Inner Life, the latest book from Pastor Edmund Chan, is an in-depth reflection on the topic of spiritual formation through discipleship.In this book, he shares on how the overemphasis on numerical growth and outward manifestations of the Christian faith has been sapping the vitality of the church and affecting how non-believers perceive Christianity. This is because many Christians do not live lives which reflect their faiths due to misunderstandings about what it really means to live a life of intimacy with God.Using his own life-experiences as examples, Edmund Chan pays special attention to dispelling the myths and obstacles that are hindering the spiritual growth of a Christian and provides the guidance that is needed to overcome them. He also touches upon some pitfalls that many Christian fall into such as serving without joy and shows us what we can do even when we are struggling to understand the will of God. The author used his personal life experiences to illustrate his points on christian growth. One of the book's main topic is intimacy with God. The book discussed several myths that people believe about intimacy with God. Here are the 4 myths:> Intimacy is the key to blessing> Intimacy is a prize> Intimacy with God is optional> Intimacy is experienced the same way by everyoneRev. Edmund Chan stated 4 truths to contradict the 4 myths.

Edmund Morris,Theodore Rex,,English,,"Theodore Roosevelt and his two-term presidency (1901-9) deserve a king-size, seize-the-man biography - and Edmund Morris has provided one. ""TR"" typifies the ""can do"" American; his famous maxim, of course, was ""Speak softly but carry a big stick."" Morris presents eyewitness history through the voices of the makers and shakers. His exhilarating narrative will captivate readers, providing welcome confirmation that this nation can produce presidents who bring leadership to great issues, hold to their purpose, and shape the destinies of nations. President McKinley's assassination brought the 43-year-old TR a challenging presidency, one to which Morris is a clearsighted guide. At home, TR had to persuade Congress to curb competition-stifling corporate trusts, monopolistic transcontinental railroads, and unhygienic food industries that saw consumers as sheep. He also faced labor and racial strife. Abroad, the American presence in Cuba and the Philippines brought criticism, the Russo-Japanese conflict threatened major power shifts in the Far East and Europe, and a politically and financially fraught decision on the Central American canal route - Panama or Nicaragua? - had to be made. TR rose to every challenge. Despite the demands of family and social life, he read, wrote, and traveled extensively. Not least, TR put national parks and conservation of natural resources on the legislative agenda.All TR's notable contemporaries - including historian Henry Adams, naturalists John Burroughs and John Muir, robber barons E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, financier J. P. Morgan, fellow politician William Howard Taft, civil rights leader Booker T. Washington, and novelist Owen Wister - appear onstage, their clear voices projecting the excitement of the day.Morris is blessed with the imagination and skills to write gripping popular history. He doesn't dilute but illuminates events in presenting an account that immediately sparks interest and captures the mind. Readers will note that American interventionism abroad (today's major issue) was much debated during TR's presidency, when major interventional imperatives challenged the new superpower's tradition of relative restraint in foreign affairs.Theodore Rex is the long-awaited second volume of the TR saga. Morris delivered the first volume,

They were held with passionate conviction, and incorporated, finally, into the constitutions of the new American states and of the United States.Though the basic theme of the book and his assessment of what the Revolution achieved remain the same, Morgan has updated the revised edition of The Birth of the Republic (1977) to include some textual and stylistic changes as well as a substantial revision of the Bibliographic Note.",The Chicago History of American Civilization,,11/06/56,February 1st 1993,[],Paperback,"['History', 'American History', 'American Revolution', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'American', 'Read For School', '18th Century', 'School', 'Classics']",,9780226537573,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388176871l/43364.jpg,3.68,[],53.0,1.0,,43364.The_Birth_of_the_Republic_1763_89,,,,,88.0,582.0,224,,University Of Chicago Press,"['127', '232', '152', '49', '22']",,,[],,

Composed as an overt moral and political allegory, The Faerie Queene, with its dramatic episodes of chivalry, pageantry and courtly love, is also a supreme work of atmosphere, colour and sensuous description.",The Faerie Queene Books,,10/29/90,June 29th 1978,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Literature', '16th Century', 'British Literature', 'Epic', 'School', 'College']",,9780140422078,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328308492l/765427.jpg,3.57,[],235.0,4.0,,765427.The_Faerie_Queene,,,,,84.0,15490.0,1248,,Penguin Classics,"['3747', '4542', '4670', '1830', '701']",,,[],,

Edmund de Waal,The Hare With Amber Eyes: A Family's Century of Art and Loss,,English,,"The Ephrussis were a grand banking family, as rich and respected as the Rothschilds, who “burned like a comet” in nineteenth-century Paris and Vienna society. Yet by the end of World War II, almost the only thing remaining of their vast empire was a collection of 264 wood and ivory carvings, none of them larger than a matchbox.The renowned ceramicist Edmund de Waal became the fifth generation to inherit this small and exquisite collection of netsuke. Entranced by their beauty and mystery, he determined to trace the story of his family through the story of the collection.The netsuke—drunken monks, almost-ripe plums, snarling tigers—were gathered by Charles Ephrussi at the height of the Parisian rage for all things Japanese. Charles had shunned the place set aside for him in the family business to make a study of art, and of beautiful living. An early supporter of the Impressionists, he appears, oddly formal in a top hat, in Renoir’s Luncheon of the Boating Party. Marcel Proust studied Charles closely enough to use him as a model for the aesthete and lover Swann in Remembrance of Things Past.Charles gave the carvings as a wedding gift to his cousin Viktor in Vienna; his children were allowed to play with one netsuke each while they watched their mother, the Baroness Emmy, dress for ball after ball. Her older daughter grew up to disdain fashionable society. Longing to write, she struck up a correspondence with Rilke, who encouraged her in her poetry.The Anschluss changed their world beyond recognition. Ephrussi and his cosmopolitan family were imprisoned or scattered, and Hitler’s theorist on the “Jewish question” appropriated their magnificent palace on the Ringstrasse. A library of priceless books and a collection of Old Master paintings were confiscated by the Nazis. But the netsuke were smuggled away by a loyal maid, Anna, and hidden in her straw mattress. Years after the war, she would find a way to return them to the family she’d served even in their exile.In The Hare with Amber Eyes, Edmund de Waal unfolds the story of a remarkable family and a tumultuous century. Sweeping yet intimate, it is a highly original meditation on art, history, and family, as elegant and precise as the netsuke themselves.",,,08/31/09,August 31st 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Art', 'Memoir', 'Japan', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir', 'France', 'Jewish']",,9780374105976,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316730175l/7821828.jpg,3.89,"['Costa Book Award for Biography (2010)', 'J.R.

Were the people who lived there blind??”Recalling the lives of artists, writers, gods, and visionaries, from the Garden of Eden to twenty-first-century New York, of the black slaves who built the White House and the women erased by men’s fears, and told in hundreds of kaleidoscopic vignettes, Mirrors is a magic mosaic of our humanity.",,,04/03/08,May 1st 2009,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Short Stories', 'Essays', 'Literature', 'Latin American', 'Philosophy', 'Poetry', 'Politics', 'World History']",,9781568584232,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442800457l/6149162._SY475_.jpg,4.37,[],151.0,2.0,,6149162-mirrors,,,,,97.0,3192.0,391,,Nation Books,"['1719', '1050', '325', '71', '27']",,,[],,

Eduardo Porter,The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do,,English,," Everything has a price, but it isn't always obvious what that price is.   Many of the prices we pay seem to make little sense. We shell out $2.29 for a coffee at Starbucks when a nearly identical brew can be had at the corner deli for less than a dollar. We may be less willing to give blood for $25 than to donate it for free. Americans hire cheap illegal immigrants to fix the roof or mow the lawn, and vote for politicians who promise to spend billions to keep them out of the country. And citizens of the industrialized West pay hundreds of dollars a year in taxes or cash for someone to cart away trash that would be a valuable commodity in poorer parts of the world. The Price of Everything starts with a simple premise: there is a price behind each choice that we make, whether we're deciding to have a baby, drive a car, or buy a book. We often fail to appreciate just how critical prices are as a motivating force shaping our lives. But their power becomes clear when distorted prices steer our decisions the wrong way.  Eduardo Porter uncovers the true story behind the prices we pay and reveals what those prices are actually telling us. He takes us on a global economic adventure, from comparing the relative price of a vote in corrupt São Tomé and in the ostensibly uncorrupt United States, to assessing the cost of happiness in Bhutan, to deducing the dollar value we assign to human life. His unique approach helps explain: * Why polygamous societies actually place a higher value on women than monogamous ones. * Why someone may find more value in a $14 million license plate than the standard issue, $95 one. * Why some government agencies believe one year of life for a senior citizen is four times more valuable than that of a younger person.  Porter weaves together the constant-and often unconscious-cost and value assessments we all make every day. While exploring the fascinating story behind the price of everything from marriage and death to mattresses and horsemeat, Porter draws unexpected connections that bridge a wide range of disciplines and cultures. The result is a cogent and insightful narrative about how the world really works.Watch a Video",,,01/01/11,January 4th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Economics', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Finance', 'Sociology', 'Audiobook', 'Money', 'Politics', 'Cultural']",,9781591843627,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442738362l/9640383._SY475_.jpg,3.36,[],64.0,1.0,,9640383-the-price-of-everything,,,,,82.0,1511.0,304,,Portfolio,"['196', '463', '581', '224', '47']",,,[],,

"Edvard Munch, J. Gill Holland (Editor), Frank Hoifodt (Foreword)",The Private Journals of Edvard Munch: We Are Flames Which Pour Out of the Earth,,English,,"Scandinavia's most famous painter, the Norwegian Edvard Munch (1863–1944), is probably best known for his painting The Scream, a universally recognized icon of terror and despair. (A version of The Scream was stolen from the Edvard Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway, in August 2004, and has not yet been recovered.) But Munch considered himself a writer as well as a painter. Munch began painting as a teenager and, in his young adulthood, studied and worked in Paris and Berlin, where he evolved a highly personal style in paintings and works on paper. And in diaries that he kept for decades, he also experimented with reminiscence, fiction, prose portraits, philosophical speculations, and surrealism. Known as an artist who captured both the ecstasies and the hellish depths of the human condition, Munch conveys these emotions in his diaries but also reveals other facets of his personality in remarks and stories that are alternately droll, compassionate, romantic, and cerebral.This English translation of Edvard Munch's private diaries, the most extensive edition to appear in any language, captures the eloquent lyricism of the original Norwegian text. The journal entries in this volume span the period from the 1880s, when Munch was in his twenties, until the 1930s, reflecting the changes in his life and his work. The book is illustrated with fifteen of Munch's drawings, many of them rarely seen before. Though excerpts from these diaries have been previously published elsewhere, no translation has captured the real passion and poetry of Munch's voice. This translation lets Munch speak for himself and evokes the primal passion of his diaries. J. Gill Holland's exceptional work adds a whole new level to our understanding of the artist and the depth of his scream.",,,06/24/04,May 2005,[],Paperback,"['Art', 'Poetry', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Art History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Journal']",,9780299198145,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328870679l/580452.jpg,3.98,[],97.0,1.0,,580452.The_Private_Journals_of_Edvard_Munch,,,,,88.0,91.0,224,,University of Wisconsin Press,"['34', '34', '12', '9', '2']",,,[],,
"Edvard Radzinsky, Judson Rosengrant (Translator)",The Rasputin File,,English,,"Rasputin: mystical monk and philandering fool; enigmatic peasant who held extraordinary sway in the court of Tsar Nicholas and his wife, Alexandra.

But in 1995, a lost file from the State Archives of Russia mysteriously turned up, a file containing the extensive and often explicit testimony of both Rasputin's inner circle and those who kept him under police surveillance.The first to draw on this substantial amplification of the record as well as numerous archival sources, Edvard Radzinsky, author of the bestselling STALIN and THE LAST TSAR, masterfully reconstructs the life of this remarkable man who rose to prominence in the twentieth-century Russia.

Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief.The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation (""Hell of a place to lose a cow,"" Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. ""Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period"").Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while.

In a voice edged with chagrin, Edward Abbey offers a portrait of the American West that we'll not soon forget, offering us the observations of a man who left the urban world behind to think about the natural world and the myths buried therein.Abbey, our foremost ""ecological philosopher,"" has a voice like no other. He can be wildly funny, ferociously acerbic, and unexpectedly moving as he ardently champions our natural wilderness and castigates those who would ravish it for the perverse pleasure of profit.",,,11/06/77,January 30th 1991,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Nature', 'Essays', 'Environment', 'Outdoors', 'Memoir', 'Philosophy', 'Natural History', 'Travel', 'Westerns']",,9780452265622,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348375907l/209666.jpg,4.18,[],63.0,1.0,,209666.The_Journey_Home,,,,,97.0,2640.0,256,,Plume,"['1086', '1036', '435', '65', '18']",,,[],,
Edward Albee,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,,English,,"""Twelve times a week,"" answered Uta Hagen when asked how often she'd like to play Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In the same way, audiences and critics alike could not get enough of Edward Albee's masterful play. A dark comedy, it portrays husband and wife George and Martha in a searing night of dangerous fun and games. By the evening's end, a stunning, almost unbearable revelation provides a climax that has shocked audiences for years. With the play's razor-sharp dialogue and the stripping away of social pretense, Newsweek rightly foresaw Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as ""a brilliantly original work of art--an excoriating theatrical experience, surging with shocks of recognition and dramatic fire [that] will be igniting Broadway for some time to come.""",,,01/01/62,August 1st 2006,"[""George (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf)"", ""Martha (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf)"", ""Nick (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf)"", ""Honey (Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf)""]",Paperback,"['Plays', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Theatre', 'Literature', 'American', 'School', '20th Century', 'Read For School']",,9780451218599,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327962277l/14940.jpg,4.08,"[""New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play (1963)""]",836.0,14.0,,14940.Who_s_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf_,,,,,94.0,59751.0,272,,NAL,"['24728', '20047', '11106', '2864', '1006']",,,['United States of America'],,
Edward Albee,Three Tall Women,,English,,"Earning a Pulitzer and three Best Play awards for 1994, Edward Albee has, in Three Tall Women, created a masterwork of modern theater. As an imperious, acerbic old woman lies dying, she is tended by two other women and visited by a young man. Albee's frank dialogue about everything from incontinence to infidelity portrays aging without sentimentality. His scenes are charged with wit, pain, and laughter, and his observations tell us about forgiveness, reconciliation, and our own fates. But it is his probing portrait of the three women that reveals Albee's genius. Separate characters on stage in the first act, yet actually the same ""everywoman"" at different ages in the second act, these ""tall women"" lay bare the truths of our lives—how we live, how we love, what we settle for, and how we die.

Sir Edward, a Rosicrucian, wrote this engaging, well-researched, novel about the eternal conflict between head and heart, between wisdom and love, played out by the Rosicrucians before the dramatic background of the French Revolution. He described his book Zanoni as ""a truth for those who can comprehend it, and an extravagance for those who cannot.""

The answers they uncovered still hold the key to how we understand the world.At the end of the seventeenth century—an age of religious wars, plague, and the Great Fire of London—when most people saw the world as falling apart, these earliest scientists saw a world of perfect order. They declared that, chaotic as it looked, the universe was in fact as intricate and perfectly regulated as a clock. This was the tail end of Shakespeare’s century, when the natural land the supernatural still twined around each other. Disease was a punishment ordained by God, astronomy had not yet broken free from astrology, and the sky was filled with omens. It was a time when little was known and everything was new. These brilliant, ambitious, curious men believed in angels, alchemy, and the devil, and they also believed that the universe followed precise, mathematical laws—-a contradiction that tormented them and changed the course of history.The Clockwork Universe is the fascinating and compelling story of the bewildered geniuses of the Royal Society, the men who made the modern world.",,,,February 8th 2011,"['Galileo Galilei', 'Isaac Newton', 'Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz', 'Robert Hooke', 'Robert Boyle', 'Tycho Brahe', 'Johannes Kepler', 'Sir Robert Murray', 'Samuel Pepys']",Hardcover,"['History', 'Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'History Of Science', 'Physics', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Philosophy', 'Religion']",,9780061719516,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328825442l/9449985.jpg,3.93,[],47.0,1.0,,9449985-the-clockwork-universe,,,,,94.0,5012.0,378,,Harper,"['1508', '2050', '1137', '248', '69']",,,"['London, England']",,

Edward Everett Hale,The Man Without A Country,,English,,"""The Man without a Country"" is a short story by American writer, Edward Everett Hale, first published during the height of the Civil War during 1863 by the leading American literary magazine of the nineteenth century, The Atlantic. It is the story of an American Army Lieutenant Philip Nolan, who gets entangled with Aaron Burr in 1807, and renounces his country during his trial for treason, saying he never wanted to hear about the United States again. The Judge asks him to recant but Nolan doesn't. So the Judge granted his request and the rest of his life Nolan spent on Navy ships around the world. The officers and crew were not allowed to mention the United States.This story came out during the height of the Civil War and served to help the Union recruit soldiers and people to their cause. It is noteworthy that Edward Everett Hale's Uncle, Edward Everett, than man he was named after, gave the two hour featured address at Gettysburg just before Lincoln's speech of 209 words and two minutes, that became the best acknowledged speech in American life. Everett, like Hale, was a total patriot and honest man, and immediately congratulated Lincoln on his fine accomplishment, ""You have done far better in your two minutes than I did in my 2 hours.""""The Man without a Country"" is still considered a major American work and read widely in American schools..

"Edward Gibbon, Daniel J. Boorstin (Introduction), Giovanni Battista Piranesi (Illustrations), Hans-Friedrich Mueller (Editor)",The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,,English,,"Length: 126 hrs and 31 minsThe History of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire was written by English historian Edward Gibbon & originally published in six quarto volumes. Volume 1 was published in 1776, going thru six printings; 2-3 in 1781; 4-6 in 1788-89. It was a major literary achievement of the 18th century, adopted as a model for the methodologies of historians.The books cover the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from 180 to 1590. They take as their material the behavior & decisions that led to the eventual fall of the Empire in East & West, offering explanations.Gibbon is called the 1st modern historian of ancient Rome. By virtue of its mostly objective approach & accurate use of reference material, his work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19-20th century historians. His pessimism & detached irony was common to the historical genre of his era. Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life (1772-89) to this one work. His Memoirs of My Life & Writings is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually became his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn.Gibbon offers an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell, a task difficult because of few comprehensive written sources, tho he wasn't the only historian to tackle the subject. Most of his ideas are taken from what few relevant records were available: those of Roman moralists of the 4-5th centuries. According to Gibbon, the Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because of lost of civic virtue. They'd become weak, outsourcing defence to barbarian mercenaries, who became so numerous & ingrained that they took over. Romans had become effeminate, incapable of tough military lifestyles. In addition, Christianity created belief that a better life existed after death, fostering indifference to the present, sapping patriotism. Its comparative pacifism tended to hamper martial spirit. Lastly, like other Enlightenment thinkers, he held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, dark age. It wasn't until his age of reason that history could progress.",,abridged,10/28/76,August 12th 2003,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Ancient History', 'Historical', 'Politics', 'World History', 'Ancient', 'Literature', '18th Century']",,9780375758119,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1435759367l/19400._SY475_.jpg,3.98,[],448.0,6.0,,19400.The_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire,,,,,92.0,11988.0,1312,,Modern Library,"['4389', '4127', '2552', '634', '286']",,,['Roman Empire'],,

Edward Gorey,Amphigorey,,English,,"The title of this deliciously creepy collection of Gorey's work stems from the word amphigory, meaning a nonsense verse or composition. As always, Gorey's painstakingly cross-hatched pen and ink drawings are perfectly suited to his oddball verse and prose.

In ""The Listing Attic,"" you'll find a set of quirky limericks such as ""A certain young man, it was noted, / Went about in the heat thickly coated; / He said, 'You may scoff, / But I shan't take it off; / Underneath I am horribly bloated.' ""Many of Gorey's tales involve untimely deaths and dreadful mishaps, but much like tragic Irish ballads with their perky rhythms and melodies, they come off as strangely lighthearted.

Edward Gould Buffum,Six Months in the Gold Mines: From a Journal of Three Years Residence in Upper and Lower California 1847-48-49.,,English,," 
  ’A classic in gold rush literature.’California History
   In this informative first-hand historical narrative, Gould Buffum delves into the world of gold-mining in 19th century California.  As he journeys to the golden regions, he provides a personal account of all aspects of mining for the precious metal. From fitfully sleeping through extreme weather conditions, basking in the natural beauty of the flowers and streams in California’s plains, bonding with Indian locals, being chased by an enormous grizzly bear, watching criminals publically lashed and hanged or struggling to find provisions beyond mouldy bread and meat and suffering disease and injury, Buffum’s journey is a memorable one.  His first-hand depictions of the joy, pleasure and pride in excavating hugely valuable amounts of gold in comparison to the disappointment and frustration in finding close to nothing render his narrative personal in every sense.  Alongside this vivid and personal portrait, Buffum offers thought-provoking commentaries on the technicalities of gold-mining, its immense impact on Californian economy, politics and population, as well as potential theories on how these gold regions came to exist.  This combination of personal portrayals and informative discussions paints a vivid, educational and captivating historical narrative that brings this fascinating portion of American history alive.  Edward Gould Buffum (1820–1867) fought in the Mexican–American War which began in 1846. After his discharge from the army in 1848, he decided to remain in California and try his hand at panning gold. These specific experiences were recorded in his book Six Months in the Gold Mine, published in 1850.  Albion Press is an imprint of Endeavour Press, the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

They are the feelings of being part of something that matters, something larger than ourselves, whether it is a friendship, marriage, team, company, or even a set of ideals. They can enrich your life, and their absence can shorten it. They are the key to what counts in life, and they are becoming harder and harder to make.  Now a noted psychiatrist outlines the steps we can take to make or reaffirm the connections that nourish the hungry heart. Through his own life experiences and those who have shared their stories with him, we learn of the great joy and peace that come from connecting, and the consequences of remaining detached.

Edward O. Wilson,On Human Nature,,English,,"No one who cares about the human future can afford to ignore E.O. Wilson's book. On Human Nature begins a new phase in the most important intellectual controversy of this generation: Is human behavior controlled by the species' biological heritage? Does this heritage limit human destiny?With characteristic pugency and simplicity of style, the author of Sociobiology challenges old prejudices and current misconceptions about the nature-nurture debate. In his new preface E. O. Wilson reflects on how he came to write this book: how The Insect Societies led him to write Sociobiology, and how the political and religious uproar that engulfed that book persuaded him to write another book that would better explain the relevance of biology to the understanding of human behavior.",,Revised,09/01/78,October 18th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Biology', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Evolution', 'Sociology', 'History', 'Nature']",,9780674016385,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388419815l/62555.jpg,4.08,"['Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (1979)', 'Alabama Author Award for Nonfiction (1980)']",98.0,1.0,,62555.On_Human_Nature,,,,,95.0,2782.0,288,,Harvard University Press,"['1092', '1005', '534', '117', '34']",,,[],,
Edward O. Wilson,The Meaning of Human Existence,,English,,"How did humanity originate and why does a species like ours exist on this planet? Do we have a special place, even a destiny in the universe? Where are we going, and perhaps, the most difficult question of all, ""Why?""In The Meaning of Human Existence, his most philosophical work to date, Pulitzer Prize–winning biologist Edward O. Wilson grapples with these and other existential questions, examining what makes human beings supremely different from all other species. Searching for meaning in what Nietzsche once called ""the rainbow colors"" around the outer edges of knowledge and imagination, Wilson takes his readers on a journey, in the process bridging science and philosophy to create a twenty-first-century treatise on human existence—from our earliest inception to a provocative look at what the future of mankind portends.Continuing his groundbreaking examination of our ""Anthropocene Epoch,"" which he began with The Social Conquest of Earth, described by the New York Times as ""a sweeping account of the human rise to domination of the biosphere,"" here Wilson posits that we, as a species, now know enough about the universe and ourselves that we can begin to approach questions about our place in the cosmos and the meaning of intelligent life in a systematic, indeed, in a testable way.Once criticized for a purely mechanistic view of human life and an overreliance on genetic predetermination, Wilson presents in The Meaning of Human Existence his most expansive and advanced theories on the sovereignty of human life, recognizing that, even though the human and the spider evolved similarly, the poet's sonnet is wholly different from the spider's web. Whether attempting to explicate ""The Riddle of the Human Species,"" ""Free Will,"" or ""Religion""; warning of ""The Collapse of Biodiversity""; or even creating a plausible ""Portrait of E.T.,"" Wilson does indeed believe that humanity holds a special position in the known universe.The human epoch that began in biological evolution and passed into pre-, then recorded, history is now more than ever before in our hands. Yet alarmed that we are about to abandon natural selection by redesigning biology and human nature as we wish them, Wilson soberly concludes that advances in science and technology bring us our greatest moral dilemma since God stayed the hand of Abraham.",The Anthropocene Epoch #2,,10/05/14,October 6th 2014,[],Hardcover,"['Science', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Evolution', 'Sociology', 'Nature', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Religion']",,9780871401007,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431901378l/20665570._SY475_.jpg,3.79,['National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2014)'],77.0,1.0,,20665570-the-meaning-of-human-existence,,,,,91.0,3572.0,207,,Liveright Publishing,"['945', '1342', '949', '258', '78']",,,[],,

"Edward S. Herman, Noam Chomsky",Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,,English,,"In this pathbreaking work, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky show that, contrary to the usual image of the news media as cantankerous, obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and defense of justice, in their actual practice they defend the economic, social, and political agendas of the privileged groups that dominate domestic society, the state, and the global order.Based on a series of case studies—including the media’s dichotomous treatment of “worthy” versus “unworthy” victims, “legitimizing” and “meaningless” Third World elections, and devastating critiques of media coverage of the U.S. wars against Indochina—Herman and Chomsky draw on decades of criticism and research to propose a Propaganda Model to explain the media’s behavior and performance. Their new introduction updates the Propaganda Model and the earlier case studies, and it discusses several other applications. These include the manner in which the media covered the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and subsequent Mexican financial meltdown of 1994-1995, the media’s handling of the protests against the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund in 1999 and 2000, and the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation. What emerges from this work is a powerful assessment of how propagandistic the U.S. mass media are, how they systematically fail to live up to their self-image as providers of the kind of information that people need to make sense of the world, and how we can understand their function in a radically new way.",,Reprint edition,10/28/88,2002,"['Jimmy Carter', 'Ronald Reagan', 'Saddam Hussein', 'Matt Taibbi']",Paperback,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Economics', 'Journalism', 'Political Science', 'Society', 'Psychology']",,9780375714498,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525166345l/12617._SY475_.jpg,4.25,[],447.0,5.0,,12617.Manufacturing_Consent,,,,,96.0,15313.0,412,,Pantheon,"['7216', '5449', '2050', '436', '162']",,,[],,

Edward T. Hall,The Silent Language,,English,,"Antropologo americano. Nasce nel 1914 a Webster Groves (Missouri), studia nelle Università di Denver e dell’Arizona (master), conseguendo poi il dottorato alla Columbia University di New York (1942). Dal 1942 al 1946 è arruolato nell’esercito, prima sul fronte europeo poi nel Pacifico. Al ritorno si stabilisce a Santa Fe, Nuovo Messico. Impegnato a osservare sul campo gli indiani Navajo, Hopi e Trukesi, gli ispano-americani di Nuovo Messico e America latina, gli arabi del Mediterraneo e gli iraniani, il suo approccio professionale non è in linea con le tradizioni dell’antropologia classica. Egli non approfondisce alcuna cultura in particolare e, utilizzando estensivamente la linguistica, acquista notorietà soprattutto per le sue ricerche e le sue pubblicazioni concernenti la ‘comunicazione interculturale’ e la ‘prossemica’ che preferisce rivolgere non tanto agli addetti ai lavori quanto al più vasto pubblico. Responsabile dei programmi di formazione nel Foreign Service Institute agli inizi degli anni Cinquanta, introduce i diplomatici alle culture straniere con una metodologia che media tra esempi concreti e generalizzazioni strutturali. Ne emerge un’antropologia insieme viva e classica che ritroviamo, poi, in tutte le sue opere.Delle opere di H. si ricordano in particolare: Il linguaggio silenzioso, Bompiani, Milano 1969 (ed. orig. 1959); La dimensione nascosta, Bompiani, Milano 1968 (ed. orig. 1966); Handbook for proxemic research, Society for the Anthropology of Visual Communication, Washington (DC) 1974; Beyond culture, Anchor Press/Doubleday, Garden City (NY) 1976; The dance of life: the other dimension of time, Anchor Press/Doubleday, Garden City (NY) 1983; Hidden differences: doing business with the Japanese, Anchor Press/Doubleday, Garden City (NY) 1987; Understanding cultural differences, Intercultural Press, Yarmouth (ME) 1990; An anthropology of everyday life.

Hall,The Dance of Life: The Other Dimension of Time,,English,,"“Hall, whose Beyond Culture and The Silent Language won a wider readership, has written a ground-breaking investigation of the ways we use and abuse time, rich in insights applicable to our lives. Business readers will enjoy the cross-cultural comparison of American know-how with practices of compartmentalized German, centralized French, and ceremonious Japanese firms.”— Publishers WeeklyIn his pioneering work The Hidden Dimension, Edward T. Hall spoke of different cultures’ concepts of space. The Dance of Life reveals the ways in which individuals in culture are tied together by invisible threads of rhythm and yet isolated from each other by hidden walls of time. Hall shows how time is an organizer of activities, a synthesizer and integrator, and a special language that reveals how we really feel about each other. Time plays a central role in the diversity of cultures such as the American and the Japanese, which Hall shows to be mirror images of each other. He also deals with how time influences relations among Western Europeans, Latin Americans, Anglo-Americans, and Native Americans.First published in 1983, this book studies how people are tied together and yet isolated by hidden threads of rhythm and walls of time.  Time is treated as a language, organizer, and message system revealing people's feelings about each other and reflecting differences between cultures.",,,,February 9th 1984,[],Paperback,"['Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Cultural', 'History', 'Cultural Studies', 'Theory']",,9780385192484,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378321753l/906340.jpg,4.12,[],84.0,1.0,,906340.The_Dance_of_Life,,,,,95.0,224.0,256,,Anchor,"['92', '84', '37', '5', '6']",,,[],,

Edward W. Said,Orientalism,,,History,"For generations now, Edward W. Said's Orientalism has defined our understanding of colonialism and empire, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a preface written by Said shortly before his death in 2003. In this highly-acclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for writers, philosophers and colonial administrators to deal with the 'otherness' of eastern culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative depictions have greatly contributed to the West's romantic and exotic picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a reflection of European imperialism and racism. Edward W. Said (1935-2003) was a Palestinian-American cultural critic and author, born in Jerusalem and educated in Egypt and the United States. His other books include The Question of Palestine, Culture and Imperialism and Out of Place: A Memoir.

Edward W. Said,The End of the Peace Process: Oslo and After,,English,,"     Soon after the Oslo accords were signed in September 1993 by Israel and Palestinian Liberation Organization, Edward Said predicted that they could not lead to real peace.  In these essays, most written for Arab and European newspapers, Said uncovers the political mechanism that advertises reconciliation in the Middle East while keeping peace out of the picture.     Said argues that the imbalance in power that forces Palestinians and Arab states to accept the concessions of the United States and Israel prohibits real negotiations and promotes the second-class treatment of Palestinians.  He documents what has really gone on in the occupied territories since the signing.  He reports worsening conditions for the Palestinians critiques Yasir Arafat's self-interested and oppressive leadership, denounces Israel's refusal to recognize Palestine's past, and—in essays new to this edition—addresses the resulting unrest.     In this unflinching cry for civic justice and self-determination, Said promotes not a political agenda but a transcendent alternative: the peaceful coexistence of Arabs and Jews enjoying equal rights and shared citizenship.",,,2000,May 8th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Politics', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'Nonfiction', 'Israel']",,9780375725746,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403194200l/78108.jpg,3.95,[],33.0,1.0,,78108.The_End_of_the_Peace_Process,,,,,95.0,177.0,432,,Vintage,"['50', '80', '39', '5', '3']",,,[],,

""Your father was the hunter,"" he confesses, ""he was not the prey."" Into this brilliant opening, Danticat tucks the seeds of all that follows: the tales of the prison guard's victims, of their families, of those who recognize him decades later on the streets of New York, of those who never see him again, but are so haunted that they believe he's still pursuing them. (A dew breaker, we learn, is a government functionary who comes in the early morning to arrest someone or to burn a house down, breaking the dew on the grass that he crosses.) Although it is frustrating, sometimes, to let go of one narrative thread to follow another, The Dew Breaker is a beautifully constructed novel that spirals back to the reformed prison guard at the end, while holding unanswered the question of redemption. --Regina Marler",,,11/05/04,March 2018,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'School', 'Adult Fiction']",,9781400034291,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522957495l/39298122._SY475_.jpg,3.81,"['Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2005)', 'PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction Nominee (2005)', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Fiction (2004)', 'The Story Prize (2004)', 'Hurston/Wright Legacy Award Nominee for Fiction (2005)']",95.0,1.0,,39298122,,,,,92.0,6645.0,224,,دار أثر,"['1661', '2682', '1778', '422', '102']",,,"['Haiti', 'Brooklyn, New York City, New York (United States)']",,

Square [sic – ed.], a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space.

Today, it is the site of Broadway and Wall Street, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and the home of millions of people, who have come from every corner of the nation and the globe.In Gotham, Edwin G.

It is an epic narrative, a story as vast and as varied as the city it chronicles, and it underscores that the history of New York is the story of our nation. Readers will relive the tumultuous early years of New Amsterdam under the Dutch West India Company, Peter Stuyvesant's despotic regime, Indian wars, slave resistance and revolt, the Revolutionary War and the defeat of Washington's army on Brooklyn Heights, the destructive seven years of British occupation, New York as the nation's first capital, the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the Erie Canal and the coming of the railroads, the growth of the city as a port and financial center, the infamous draft riots of the Civil War, the great flood of immigrants, the rise of mass entertainment such as vaudeville and Coney Island, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the birth of the skyscraper. Here too is a cast of thousands--the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Clement Moore, who saved Greenwich Village from the city's street-grid plan; Herman Melville, who painted disillusioned portraits of city life; and Walt Whitman, who happily celebrated that same life. We meet the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Boss Tweed and his nemesis, cartoonist Thomas Nast; Emma Goldman and Nellie Bly; Jacob Riis and Horace Greeley; police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt; Colonel Waring and his ""white angels"" (who revolutionized the sanitation department); millionaires John Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and William Randolph Hearst; and hundreds more who left their mark on this great city.The events and people who crowd these pages guarantee that this is no mere local history. It is in fact a portrait of the heart and soul of America, and a book that will mesmerize everyone interested in the peaks and valleys of American life as found in the greatest city on earth. Gotham is a dazzling read, a fast-paced, brilliant narrative that carries the reader along as it threads hundreds of stories into one great blockbuster of a book.",Gotham #1,,11/19/98,October 19th 2000,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'New York', 'American History', 'Cities', 'The United States Of America', 'Urban Studies', 'American', 'Historical', 'Reference']",,9780195140491,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924946l/217329.jpg,4.26,"['Pulitzer Prize for History (1999)', 'New York City Book Award for Book of the Year (1998)']",79.0,1.0,,217329.Gotham,,,,,96.0,2221.0,1408,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['1074', '746', '319', '61', '21']",,,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'New York State (United States)']",,
Edy Zaqeus (Goodreads Author),Bob Sadino : Mereka Bilang Saya Gila!,,Indonesian,,"Bob Sadino sering dianggap sebagai seorang entrepreneur ikon di Indonesia. Keberhasilannya menjadi pionir di bidang agrobisnis dan agroindustri dengan bendera Kemchicks Group begitu membekas.

Efraim Medina Reyes,Érase una vez el amor pero tuve que matarlo. Musica de Sex Pistols y Nirvana,,Spanish,,"Un romanzo egocentrico, disordinato, eclettico, rabbioso. Rep è una specie di eroe perseguitato dal destino, in fuga dalla realtà immobile di Cartagena. Vuole cominciare una nuova vita, non importa quale, ma intanto vuole dimenticare la ragazza che lo ha lasciato (e qui si innesta l'evocazione della love story di una celebre coppia dell'olimpo del rock, Sid Vicious e Nancy). Scappa per inconcludenti soggiorni nella metropoli (Bogotà), zigzagando fra le bombe degli attentati politici, le risse notturne, le sbornie e la noia. Come Kurt Cobain, Rep si sente intrappolato in qualcosa che ovviamente non è il successo che portò la rockstar alla morte ma che comunque ha a che fare con il vivere in prima linea, sempre a due passi dal vuoto, sempre a due passi dal senso di una vita deliberatamente caotica. D'altro canto Rep ha una disperata vitalità che si esprime in performance erotiche, in passionali rapporti di amicizia, in maestosi accessi di ira e di gioia. Non c'è il buio in fondo alla sua strada ma un'ansia di liberazione che, beffardamente, si traduce anche in una sonora presa in giro del realismo magico sudamericano (le pene d'amore avrebbero a che fare con una carota surgelata carica di malefici...).

Benteng-benteng dirusak, desa-desa dijarah, ladang-ladang dibakar.Di tengah-tengah penghancuran ini, muncul tiga orang yang bercita-cita mempersatukan bangsa. Nobunaga yang ekstrem, penuh kharisma, namun brutal. Ieyasu yang tenang, berhati-hati, bijaksana, berani di medan perang, dan dewasa. Namun kunci dari tiga serangkai ini adalah Hideyoshi, si kurus berwajah monyet yang secara tak terduga menjadi juru selamat bagi negeri porak-poranda ini. Ia lahir sebagai anak petani, menghadapu dunia tanpa bekal apapun, namun kecerdasannya berhasil mengubah pelayan yang ragu-ragu menjadi setia, saingan menjadi teman, dan musuh menjadi sekutu.

Eiji Yoshikawa,Taiko 1 - Tahun Temmon Kelima 1536,,Indonesian,,"Dalam pergolakan menjelang dekade abad keenam belas, Kekaisaran Jepang menggeliat dalam kekacau-balauan ketika keshogunan tercerai-berai dan panglima-panglima perang musuh berusaha merebut kemenangan. Benteng-benteng dirusak, desa-desa dijarah, ladang-ladang dibakar.Di tengah-tengah penghancuran ini, muncul tiga orang yang bercita-cita mempersatukan bangsa. Nobunaga yang ekstrem, penuh kharisma, namun brutal. Ieyasu yang tenang, berhati-hati, bijaksana, berani di medan perang, dan dewasa. Namun kunci dari tiga serangkai ini adalah Hideyoshi, si kurus berwajah monyet yang secara tak terduga menjadi juru selamat bagi negeri porak-poranda ini. Ia lahir sebagai anak petani, menghadapu dunia tanpa bekal apapun, namun kecerdasannya berhasil mengubah pelayan yang ragu-ragu menjadi setia, saingan menjadi teman, dan musuh menjadi sekutu.

"Eiji Yoshikawa, William Scott Wilson (Translator)",Taiko: An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan,,English,,"In the tempestuous closing decades of the sixteenth century, the Empire of Japan writhes in chaos as the shogunate crumbles and rival warlords battle for supremacy. Warrior monks in their armed citadels block the road to the capital; castles are destroyed, villages plundered, fields put to the torch.Amid this devastation, three men dream of uniting the nation. At one extreme is the charismatic but brutal Nobunaga, whose ruthless ambition crushes all before him. At the opposite pole is the cold, deliberate Ieyasu, wise in counsel, brave in battle, mature beyond his years. But the keystone of this triumvirate is the most memorable of all, Hideyoshi, who rises from the menial post of sandal bearer to become Taiko-absolute ruler of Japan in the Emperor's name.When Nobunaga emerges from obscurity by destroying an army ten times the size of his own, he allies himself with Ieyasu, whose province is weak, but whose canniness and loyalty make him invaluable. Yet it is the scrawny, monkey-faced Hideyoshi-brash, impulsive, and utterly fearless-who becomes the unlikely savior of this ravaged land. Born the son of a farmer, he takes on the world with nothing but his bare hands and his wits, turning doubters into loyal servants, rivals into faithful friends, and enemies into allies. In all this he uses a piercing insight into human nature that unlocks castle gates, opens men's minds, and captures women's hearts. For Hideyoshi's passions are not limited to war and intrigue-his faithful wife, Nene, holds his love dear, even when she must share it; the chaste Oyu, sister of Hideyoshi's chief strategist, falls prey to his desires; and the seductive Chacha, whom he rescues from the fiery destruction of her father's castle, tempts his weakness.As recounted by Eiji Yoshikawa, author of the international best-seller Musashi, Taiko tells many stories: of the fury of Nobunaga and the fatal arrogance of the black-toothed Yoshimoto; of the pathetic downfall of the House of Takeda; how the scorned Mitsuhide betrayed his master; how once impregnable ramparts fell as their defenders died gloriously. Most of all, though, Taiko is the story of how one man transformed a nation through the force of his will and the depth of his humanity. Filled with scenes of pageantry and violence, acts of treachery and self-sacrifice, tenderness and savagery, Taiko combines the panoramic spectacle of a Kurosawa epic with a vivid evocation of feudal Japan.",,,10/28/45,January 16th 2001,"['Hideyoshi Toyotomi', 'Nobunaga Oda', 'Ieyasu Tokugawa']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Japan', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Japanese Literature', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'War', 'Literature', 'Asia']",,9784770026095,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348457306l/336228.jpg,4.26,[],381.0,4.0,,336228.Taiko,,,,,96.0,4026.0,926,,Kodansha,"['1958', '1360', '550', '109', '49']",,,['Japan'],,

Eileen Welsome,The Plutonium Files: America's Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War,,English,,"When the vast wartime factories of the Manhattan Project began producing plutonium in quantities never before seen on earth, scientists working on the  top-secret bomb-building program grew apprehensive. Fearful that plutonium  might cause a cancer epidemic among workers and desperate to learn more about what it could do to the human body, the Manhattan Project's medical doctors embarked upon an experiment in which eighteen unsuspecting patients in  hospital wards throughout the country were secretly injected with the cancer-causing substance. Most of these patients would go to their graves without ever knowing what had been done to them.Now, in The Plutonium Files, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eileen Welsome reveals for the first time the breadth of the extraordinary fifty-year cover-up surrounding the plutonium injections, as well as the deceitful nature of thousands of other experiments conducted on American citizens in the postwar years. Welsome's remarkable investigation spans the 1930s to the 1990s and draws upon hundreds of newly declassified documents and other primary sources to disclose this shadowy chapter in American history. She gives a voice to such innocents as Helen Hutchison, a young woman who entered a prenatal clinic in Nashville for a routine checkup and was instead given a radioactive ""cocktail"" to drink; Gordon Shattuck, one of several boys at a state school for the developmentally disabled in Massachusetts who was fed radioactive oatmeal for breakfast; and Maude Jacobs, a Cincinnati woman suffering from cancer and subjected to an experimental radiation treatment designed to help military planners learn how to win a nuclear war. Welsome also tells the stories of the scientists themselves, many of whom learned the ways of secrecy on the Manhattan Project. Among them are Stafford Warren, a grand figure whose bravado masked a cunning intelligence; Joseph Hamilton, who felt he was immune to the dangers of radiation only to suffer later from a fatal leukemia; and physician Louis Hempelmann, one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the plan to inject humans with potentially carcinogenic doses of plutonium. Hidden discussions of fifty years past are reconstructed here, wherein trusted government officials debated the ethical and legal implications of the experiments, demolishing forever the argument that these studies took place in a less enlightened era. Powered by her groundbreaking reportage and singular narrative gifts, Eileen Welsome has created a work of profound humanity as well as major historical significance.From the Hardcover edition.",,,1999,October 20th 2010,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Politics', 'American History', 'War', 'Research', 'Biology']",,9780385319546,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601566939l/212087.jpg,4.23,['PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction Writers (2000)'],20.0,1.0,,212087.The_Plutonium_Files,,,,,97.0,430.0,592,,Delta,"['200', '145', '70', '12', '3']",,,[],,

Instead, I walked toward him quite calmly, or I thought I was calm. Yet I do remember wondering if I had combed my hair that morning. I do remember being glad I had worn a bra and wishing it were not so plain and businesslike. And I remember thinking of one more thing to add to my 'before I die' list - not the list I'd written out of things a person can actually arrange on purpose, but the mental list of things I would most likely die without: passion. It is a measure of how dazzled I was that I completely failed to see any significance in such a thought at that particular moment."" And so begins The Falconer, a stunning love story set in the Sierra Nevada mountains, about two ordinary people whose lives are transformed by love. India Blake realizes that she has let her life pass in dutiful commitments, without living fully, without achieving her dream of adventure and love.

Elaine Morgan,The Descent of Woman,,English,,"The Descent of Woman is a pioneering work, the first to argue for the equal role of women in human evolution. On its first publication in 1972 it sparked an international debate and became a rallying-point for feminism, changing the terminology of anthropologists forever. Starting with her demolition of the Biblical myth that woman was an afterthought to the creation of man, Elaine Morgan rewrites human history and evolution.This lively, informative book sets out to solve the riddle of our origins; its answer is controversial. Elaine Morgan has made The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and The Descent of Woman first set out an understanding of who humans are and where they came from.Elaine Morgan was best known as a writer for television until the publication of The Descent of Woman in 1972, which became an international bestseller. She then spent ten years researching human evolution before publishing The Aquatic Ape (published by Souvenir Press as a revised edition, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis) in 1982. In the years since, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis has gone on to win widespread support among scientists.It is a measure of Elaine Morgan's enduring importance, provocative thought and international reputation that in January 2006, the first Chinese translation of The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis became a Number 1 bestseller in Taiwan.",,,11/05/72,February 28th 2001,[],Paperback,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Evolution', 'Anthropology', 'History', 'Biology', 'Womens', 'Gender', 'Sexuality']",,9780285627000,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328829965l/305689.jpg,4.16,[],74.0,1.0,,305689.The_Descent_of_Woman,,,,,95.0,718.0,288,,Souvenir Press,"['320', '246', '114', '24', '14']",,,[],,

Square blue-tinted eyeglasses highlighted even bluer eyes. She was smart, sassy, way too funny – and she had no idea she was all that.When she pulled the pencil from her topknot, he watched her hair untangle and drift down to her shoulders, in a sexy-just-out-of-bed, mess-me-up-more tumble. Adam hadn't realized he was even holding his breath, until he coughed in relief.Right now, she was mad! Her barefoot angrily tapping against the carpet. And way too sexy, he tried to blink that observation away. There was nothing left to do but apologize. But she had looked him straight in the eye and insulted him!Even after two tours of duty in Fallujah, Adam wasn't sure he could handle a woman who: wrangled a team of SEALS for the Wounded Warrior Project, was banned from singing, humming or playing golf, had an oven timer that played Beethoven's Fifth, loved all things chocolate way too much, preferred puppy kisses over his, and owned a moose named Morti.There was only one thing for this Marine to do – man up, take her down and demand a zerbert – whatever the hell that was!Copyright ©2012 by Elaine Raco Chase updated version of Rules of the Game.Over 15,000 words added, new characters, plot points and enhanced, mature adult content (over eighteen, please!)",,Second Edition,05/28/80,January 26th 2012 ,[],Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Fiction', 'Military Fiction']",,9780786251100,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329343882l/13486762.jpg,3.73,[],70.0,1.0,,13486762-rules-of-the-game,,,,,86.0,113.0,238,,,"['30', '40', '27', '14', '2']",,,[],,

The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it.

Elan Golomb,Trapped in T Mirror,,,Family & Relationships,"In this compelling book, Elan Golomb identifies the crux of the emotional and psychological problems of millions of adults. Simply put, the children of narcissist -- offspring of parents whose interest always towered above the most basic needs of their sons and daughters -- share a common belief: They believe they do not have the right to exist. The difficulties experienced by adult children of narcissists can manifest themselves in many ways: for examples, physical self-loathing that takes form of overeating, anorexia, or bulimia; a self-destructive streak that causes poor job performance and rocky personal relationships; or a struggle with the self that is perpetuated in the adult's interaction with his or her own children. These dilemmas are both common and correctable, Dr. Golomb tells us. With an empathic blend of scholarship and case studies, along with her own personal narrative of her fight for self, Dr. Golomb plumbs the depths of this problem, revealing its mysterious hold on the affairs of otherwise bright, aware, motivated, and worthy people. Trapped in the Mirror explores. the nature of the paralysis and lack of motivation so many adults feel stress and its role in exacerbating childhood wrongs why do many of our relationships seem to be ""reruns"" of the past how one's body image can be formed by faulty parenting how anger must be acknowledge to be overcome and, most important, how even the most traumatized self can be healed.

Elan Mastai (Goodreads Author),All Our Wrong Todays,,English,,"You know the future that people in the 1950s imagined we'd have? Well, it happened. In Tom Barren's 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed . . . because it wasn't necessary. Except Tom just can't seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that's before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and—maybe, just maybe—his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality?

The book has a sumptuous package with a strong appeal for fans of Historical Fiction. Follow up book from Eleanor De Jong was Jezebel-another infamous fallen woman from biblical history. Part of our strategic plan to bolster Avon's historical offering which has so far been hugely successful. About the Book: Delilah Maligned as the courtesan who revealed the mighty Samson's secret for money, Delilah has become synonymous with treachery. But behind the myth is a tale far more tragic? From the moment they met, there was a fire in their relationship, with Samson pitted against Delilah's family. But Samson soon develops an overwhelming passion for Delilah; entranced by her beauty and passionate nature. Meanwhile the Israelites and the Philistines are in a state of constant conflict, with Samson a seemingly unbeatable warrior. The Philistines are desperate to learn the secret behind Samson's power and enrol Delilah as a pawn to bring him down. Driven by misplaced anger, Delilah agrees to use her wiles to discover the secret of his strength. But Delilah finds that Samson is far from the ogre that she had assumed. But a sequence of events have been set in motion which both of them are powerless to stop. The consequences of her mistake have gone down in history and this wonderful novel is as alluring and beguiling as Delilah herself. The perfect treat for fans of Anita Diamant and Helen Dunmore.

Eleanor Herman,Sex with the Queen,"900 Years of Vile Kings, Virile Lovers, and Passionate Politics",,History,"In this follow-up to her bestselling Sex with Kings, Eleanor Herman reveals the truth about what goes on behind the closed door of a queen's boudoir. Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent—and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone—swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals—many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen—from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen's lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair's implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics—not the sex—that caused a royal woman's tragedy—or her ultimate triumph.",,,,2006.0,,,,0060846739,9780060846732,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5GSgQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.91,,,,,,,,,,,,336.0,,,,3676.0,,,,

In the field of psychology, beginning in the 1950s, Eleanor J. Gibson nearly single-handedly developed the field of perceptual learning with a series of brilliant studies that culminated in the seminal work, Perceptual Learning and Development. An Odyssey in Learning and Perception brings together Gibson's scientific papers, including difficult-to-find or previously unpublished work, along with classic studies in perception and action. Gibson introduces each paper to show why the research was undertaken and concludes each section with comments linking the findings to later developments.

The article prompted tens of thousands of reader responses, and was endorsed by numerous high-profile celebrities, including Caitlin Moran.In Anxiety for Beginners, Morgan digs even deeper, combining her own experiences, rendered in achingly honest, often hilarious detail, with extensive research and input from experts (neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists and fellow sufferers—including some familiar faces). With her brilliant wit and warmth, Morgan not only explores the roots of her own anxiety, but also investigates what might be contributing to the suffering of so many of us around the world. At its heart, Anxiety for Beginners is a book about acceptance, as Morgan uncovers how we can live lives that are not just manageable but enjoyable—by learning to accept anxiety as part of who we are, rather than wasting years being ashamed of it.",,,05/31/16,May 2nd 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Health', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography']",,9781443448918,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465002259l/29938403.jpg,3.91,[],99.0,1.0,,29938403-anxiety-for-beginners,,,,,93.0,389.0,384,,HarperCollins Publishers,"['116', '157', '88', '22', '6']",,,[],,

The Story of a New Name is the second book in this series. With these books, which the New Yorker's James Wood described as ""large, captivating, amiably peopled ... a beautiful and delicate tale of confluence and reversal,"" Ferrante proves herself to be one of Italy's most accomplished storytellers. She writes vividly about a specific neighborhood of Naples from the late-1950s through to the current day and about two remarkable young women who are very much the products of that place and time. Yet in doing so she has created a world in which readers will recognize themselves and has drawn a marvelously nuanced portrait of friendship.In The Story of a New Name, Lila has recently married and made her entrée into the family business; Elena, meanwhile, continues her studies and her exploration of the world beyond the neighborhood that she so often finds stifling. Love, jealousy, family, freedom, commitment, and above all friendship: these are signs under which both women live out this phase in their stories. Marriage appears to have imprisoned Lila, and the pressure to excel is at times too much for Elena. Yet the two young women share a complex and evolving bond that is central to their emotional lives and is a source of strength in the face of life's challenges.

Both are now adults; life’s great discoveries have been made, its vagaries and losses have been suffered. Through it all, the women’s friendship has remained the gravitational center of their lives. Both women once fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew up—a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. In this final book, she has returned to Naples. Lila, on the other hand, never succeeded in freeing herself from the city of her birth. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Proximity to the world she has always rejected only brings her role as its unacknowledged leader into relief.

Elena Poniatowska,Leonora,,Spanish,,"Una mujer indomable, un espíritu rebelde. Estaba destinada a crecer como la rica heredera de un magnate de la industria textil, pero desde pequeña supo que era diferente, que su capacidad de ver lo que otros no veían, de conectar con los animales, la convertía en especial. Desafió las convenciones sociales, a sus padres y maestros, y rompió cualquier atadura religiosa o ideológica para conquistar su derecho a ser una mujer libre, personal y artísticamente. Leonora Carrington es hoy una leyenda, la más importante pintora surrealista, y su fascinante vida, el material del que se nutren nuestros sueños.Fantasiosa y excéntrica en su infancia, desafiante en su adolescencia, Leonora vivió la más turbulenta historia de amor con el pintor Max Ernst. Con él se sumergió en el torbellino del surrealismo, y se codeó en París con Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, Joan Miró, André Breton o Pablo Picasso; por Max enloqueció cuando fue enviado a un campo de concentración. A Leonora se la confinó en un manicomio de Santander, del que escapó para conquistar Nueva York de la mano de Peggy Guggenheim. Se instaló en México casándose con el poeta y periodista Renato Leduc; aquí culmina una de las obras artísticas y literarias más singulares y geniales.No es la primera vez que Elena Poniatowska retrata como nadie a una mujer excepcional. La increíble vida de Leonora Carrington es, en sus manos, una aventura apasionante, un grito de libertad y una elegante aproximación a las vanguardias históricas de la primera mitad del siglo XX.

Estudiantes, obreros, padres y madres de familia, profesores, empleados, soldados y hombres de estado, en fin, diversos componentes de la sociedad mexicana actual, aportan su modo de ver, sentir y considerar los acontecimientos.

Her life appears to be a seamless tissue of boredom, but Erika, a quiet thirty-eight-year-old, secretly visits Turkish peep shows at night to watch live sex shows and sadomasochistic films. Meanwhile, a handsome, self-absorbed, seventeen-year-old student has become enamored with Erika and sets out to seduce her. She resists him at first, but then the dark passions roiling under the piano teacher's subdued exterior explode in a release of sexual perversity, suppressed violence, and human degradation.Celebrated throughout Europe for the intensity and frankness of her writings and awarded the Heinrich Böll Prize for her outstanding contribution to German letters, Elfriede Jelinek is one of the most original and controversial writers in the world today.

"Eli Clare (Goodreads Author), Suzanne Pharr (Foreword)","Exile and Pride: Disability, Queerness, and Liberation",,English,,"“Eli Clare works a vital alchemy. . . . Using the language of the elemental world, he delineates a complex human intersection and transmutes cruelty into its opposite—a potent, lifegiving remedy.”—Alison Bechdel, author of Fun HomeFirst published in 1999, Exile & Pride established Eli Clare as one of the leading writers on the intersections of queerness and disability. With this critical tenth-anniversary edition, the groundbreaking publication secures its position as essential to the history of queer and disability politics, and, through significant new material that boldly interrogates and advances the original text, to its future as well. Clare’s writing on his experiences as a genderqueer activist/writer with cerebral palsy permanently changed the landscape of disability politics and queer liberation, and yet Exile & Pride is much too great in scope to be defined by even these two issues. Instead it offers an intersectional framework for understanding how our bodies actually experience the politics of oppression, power, and resistance. At the heart of Clare’s exploration of environmental destruction, white working-class identity, queer community, disabled sexuality, childhood sexual abuse, coalition politics, and his own gender transition is a call for social justice movements that are truly accessible for everyone.Blending prose and theory, personal experience and political debate, anger and compassion, Exile & Pride provides a window into a world where our whole selves in all their complexity can be loved and accepted.An award-winning poet and essayist, Eli Clare is also the author of The Marrow’s Telling.",,,,September 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Disability', 'Queer', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'LGBT', 'Disability Studies', 'Feminism', 'Social Justice', 'Gender', 'Transgender']",,9780896086050,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328770006l/534753.jpg,4.36,[],65.0,1.0,,534753.Exile_and_Pride,,,,,96.0,1665.0,147,,South End Press,"['942', '472', '177', '49', '25']",,,[],,

"Elie Wiesel, Anne Borchardt (Translation)",Day,,English,,"""Not since Albert Camus has there been such an eloquent spokesman for man."" --The New York Times Book ReviewThe publication of Day restores Elie Wiesel's original title to the novel initially published in English as The Accident and clearly establishes it as the powerful conclusion to the author's classic trilogy of Holocaust literature, which includes his memoir Night and novel Dawn. ""In Night it is the ‘I' who speaks,"" writes Wiesel. ""In the other two, it is the ‘I' who listens and questions.""In its opening paragraphs, a successful journalist and Holocaust survivor steps off a New York City curb and into the path of an oncoming taxi. Consequently, most of Wiesel's masterful portrayal of one man's exploration of the historical tragedy that befell him, his family, and his people transpires in the thoughts, daydreams, and memories of the novel's narrator. Torn between choosing life or death, Day again and again returns to the guiding questions that inform Wiesel's trilogy: the meaning and worth of surviving the annihilation of a race, the effects of the Holocaust upon the modern character of the Jewish people, and the loss of one's religious faith in the face of mass murder and human extermination.",The Night Trilogy #3,,03/01/61,March 21st 2006,"['Lady Kathleen Ravenel', 'Eliezer', 'Dr. Paul Russel']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'War', 'Literature', 'Jewish', 'Religion']",,9780809023097,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422507794l/11168.jpg,3.83,[],98.0,1.0,,11168.Day,,,,,90.0,8846.0,109,,Hill and Wang,"['2689', '3008', '2272', '710', '167']",,,[],,

Eliezer Yudkowsky (Goodreads Author),Rationality: From AI to Zombies,,English,,"What does it actually mean to be rational? Not Hollywood-style ""rational,"" where you forsake all human feeling to embrace Cold Hard Logic. Real rationality, of the sort studied by psychologists, social scientists, and mathematicians. The kind of rationality where you make good decisions, even when it's hard; where you reason well, even in the face of massive uncertainty; where you recognize and make full use of your fuzzy intuitions and emotions, rather than trying to discard them.  In ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies,"" Eliezer Yudkowsky explains the science underlying human irrationality with a mix of fables, argumentative essays, and personal vignettes. These eye-opening accounts of how the mind works (and how, all too often, it doesn't!) are then put to the test through some genuinely difficult puzzles: computer scientists' debates about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), physicists' debates about the relationship between the quantum and classical worlds, philosophers' debates about the metaphysics of zombies and the nature of morality, and many more. In the process, ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies"" delves into the human significance of correct reasoning more deeply than you'll find in any conventional textbook on cognitive science or philosophy of mind.  A decision theorist and researcher at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Yudkowsky published earlier drafts of his writings to the websites Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong. ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies"" compiles six volumes of Yudkowsky's essays into a single electronic tome. Collectively, these sequences of linked essays serve as a rich and lively introduction to the science—and the art—of human rationality.",,,,March 11th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unfinished', 'Self Help', 'Technology', 'Logic', 'Education']",,9781939311153,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440562023l/25131230._SX318_.jpg,4.36,[],299.0,3.0,,25131230-rationality,,,,,95.0,1168.0,1813,,Machine Intelligence Research Institute,"['675', '306', '134', '39', '14']",,,[],,

Yabancı işte ilk bu fireyi vermeyi öğrenir. Yabancı bir ülkede yaşamının birinci icabı insanın en aşina olduğu şeye, ismine yabancılaşmasıdır.(Arka Kapak)""Ne hoş tesadüf,"" dedi Debra zoraki bir neşeyle, ""çok sevindim. Ne kadar iyi bir ahçı olduğunu biliyorum."" Değişik bir hali vardı, okuma grubundakinden çok daha kendine güvenli görünüyordu. ""Senin için bir sakıncası yoksa çalışmaya hemen başlayalım, zaman geçiyor ve hiçbir şey hazır değil.""Alegre'yi soktuğu çivit mavisi mutfak duvardan duvara paketler, kutular, konserve kutuları ve kavanozlarla doluydu, gıda, gıda, gıda. Misafirlerin yediden sonra gelecekleri ve büyük olasılıkla sekiz buçuk civarında kurt gibi acıkacakları söylendi. Toplam yirmi iki kişi bekleniyordu. ""Biz de iki kişiyiz. Doyuracak yirmi dört boğaz eder. Ne dersin? Başarabilir miyiz?""Ama çok geçmeden ortaya çıkacağı üzre ""biz"" diye bir şey yoktu. Sadece Alegre vardı. Kendi ahçılık tarihinde bu kadar kısa sürede, bu kadar çok insan için bu kadar çok yemek pişirdiği olmamıştı hiç. Yine de yiyecek konusunda kendisine böyle muhtaç olunması sinirlerini yatıştırmış olacaktı çünkü kendini bu işin altından kalkmaya tamamen muktedir hissediyordu. O malzemeleri incelerken Debra Ellen Thompson da onu inceleyecek vakit buldu. Alegre'nin değişik bir hali vardı şimdi, okuma grubunda olduğundan daha az ürkekti.Gerçekten de kendinden emindi Alegre, hatta Debra nihayet mutfak kapısının öteki tarafındaki sürekli mızıldanan kadın sesinin yardımına koşup onu mutfakta yalnız bıraktığında kendine güveni iyice artacaktı; dışarıdan gelen sese bakılırsa biri oturma odasını akşam için derleyip toplamaya çalışıyor ama aslında bu işi yapmak istemiyordu, hem de hiç. Alegre mutfakta tek başına kalınca oturma odasında olanları hiç merak etmedi, tıpkı evin geri kalanıyla ya da misafirlerin nasıl insanlar olduklarıyla ilgilenmediği gibi. O olmak istediği yerdeydi: mutfakta. Başka birine ait olsa da onun mutfağıydı burası artık. Tek bilmek istediği tam olarak ne pişirmesinin istendiğiydi. Ama kimse bu konuyu açıklığa kavuşturmak için gelmedi. Onun yerine içeri komik, basık burunlu, aşırı uzun tüylü, duman grisi tombul bir kedi girdi ihtişamla, hemen onun arkasından da ne işler karıştırdığını anlamak için yine aynı türden, tekir ve belki daha az mağrur bir başka kedi geldi. Evsahiplerinin ona nasıl bir menü istedikleri konusunda ipucu verecek kadar sorumlu davranmasını beklemekten ve kedileri seyretmekten sıkılan Alegre bu yiyecek gemisinin tek kaptanının kendisi olduğuna ve karar vermenin de kendisine düştüğüne kanaat getirdi. Buzdolabında bulduğu keçi peynirini pidelerin üzerine ufaladı. Dolaplarda bir sürü ton balığı konservesi buldu ve bunlardan bol bol şehriyeli ton balığı fettuccine yaptı. Buzluktaki kıyma çabucak köfteye dönüştü; tezgâhın üzerindeki lahana barbunyalı lahana salatası oldu; artık mısırların bir kısmı puding, geri kalanı mısırlı kabak sotesi halini aldı. Patatesler her zamanki gibi fazlasıyla işe yaradı. Alegre onları haşladı, kızarttı, fırınladı, ezdi, üzerlerine çeşit çeşit baharatlarla soslar döktü. Geri kalanları domuz pastırması ve peynirle doldurdu. Dolaplarda bulduğu tako soslarının hiçbirini fazla tutmasa da tavuklu burritos doldurdu. Fıstıklı banma sosu ve tavuk ciğerli börek hazırladı. Bildik aperitifleri sıraladı – sarımsak soslu karides, söğüş salata ve peynirler. İki koca kâse cevizli Sezar salatası ve birilerinin bütün bunlara rağmen aç kalması ihtimaline karşı yirmi dört tane hindili klüp sandvici yan yana dizdi. Geri kalan yumurtalarla limon suyunu limon kremalı turta yapmakta kullandı. Buzdolabında gördüğü yığın yığın muzla da muzlu turta yapmayı planlıyordu ki, yorgunluktan bitkin düştüğü için oturup biraz dinlenmesi gerekti.Bu yiyeceklerin hiçbirini değil yemek tatmak dahi istemiyordu. Çantasını dolduran kırmızı greyfurtları çıkardı ve çiğnerken hesaba başladı: 11 kırmızı greyfurt, her biri 70 kalori, toplamda 910 kalori!""Şu hale bak, inanamıyorum!"" Debra Ellen Thompson iki küsur saattir adımını atmadığı mutfağa girdiğinde bağırmaktan kendini alamamıştı. Tezgâhın üzerindeki her yemeğin karşısında konuk selamlar gibi tek tek saygıyla durdu. ""Tanrım, ne diyeceğimi bilemiyorum. Muhteşem bir iş çıkarmışsın. Bu müthiş! Müthiş!""Ama kendisi ""müthiş! müthiş!"" görünmüyordu hatta ""müthiş!"" bile görünmüyordu. Daha ziyade saatlerdir ağlıyormuş gibi görünüyordu.""Sen iyi misin?"" diye sordu Alegre kaşla göz arasında greyfurt kabuğu yığınını ortadan kaldırarak.""Evet... aslında hayır... ev arkadaşımın canı son zamanlarda çok sıkkındı, onu neşelendirmek için mutfağı çivit mavisine boyadım... en sevdiği renk... ama pek işe yaramadı, sonra bir parti vermenin iyi bir fikir olacağını düşündüm ama ne kadar salaklık ettiğimi şimdi anlıyorum... bu kalabalık ona iyi gelmeyecek.""Alegre ona, ev arkadaşını mutlu etmesinin neden bu kadar önemli olduğunu sormak istedi ama birden bu yorumun fazlasıyla Connie-vari olacağını hissetti. Hem gerçekten de çene çalacak zaman değildi. Misafirler gelmeye başlamışlardı bile.Bütün tepsilerle tabaklar oturma odasına taşındıktan sonra Alegre mutfakta yine yalnız kaldı. İçeri girip insanlarla tanışacağına ve onlarla birlikte yiyeceğine söz vermişti Debra'ya ama son anda yan çizeceğini gayet iyi biliyordu. Mutfağı toplamayı, tezgâhı temizlemeyi, çöpleri atmayı, birkaç tava ovmayı tercih etti. Sonra içerideki seslerin dingin bir müzik çeşitlemesine, neşeli sohbetlere, hafif şakalara, şen gaflara çoğalmasını dinleyerek üç greyfurt daha yedi, 210 kalori daha; giderek değişti sesler, ara sıra sinirli alaylar, aksi atışmalar da çalınıyordu kulağa. Derken bir yerlerden davul sesleri yükseldi ve fonda çalınan müzik aniden hızlandı. İçerdeki herkes aynı anda dans etmeyi zıplamakla, zıplamayı da tepinmek ve hoplamakla karıştırmaya karar vermişçesine zangır zangır sarsılmaya başladı ev.",,,10/30/04,April 28th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Turkish Literature', 'Turkish', 'Contemporary', 'Roman', 'Novels', 'LGBT', 'Book Club']",,9789753424653,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377139104l/281346.jpg,3.69,[],99.0,1.0,,281346.Araf,,,,,88.0,2889.0,352,,Metis Yayınları,"['700', '1043', '792', '254', '100']",,,[],,
"Elif Shafak (Goodreads Author), Hande Zapsu Watt (Translator)","Black Milk: On Writing, Motherhood, and the Harem Within",,English,,"An acclaimed Turkish novelist's personal account of balancing a writer's life with a mother's life.   After the birth of her first child in 2006, Turkish writer Elif Shafek suffered from postpartum depression that triggered a profound personal crisis. Infused with guilt, anxiety, and bewilderment about whether she could ever be a good mother, Shafak stopped writing and lost her faith in words altogether. In this elegantly written memoir, she retraces her journey from free-spirited, nomadic artist to dedicated but emotionally wrought mother. Identifying a constantly bickering harem of women who live inside of her, each with her own characteristics--the cynical intellectual, the goal-oriented go-getter, the practical-rational, the spiritual, the maternal, and the lustful--she craves harmony, or at least a unifying identity. As she intersperses her own experience with the lives of prominent authors such as Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Alice Walker, Ayn Rand, and Zelda Fitzgerald, Shafak looks for a solution to the inherent conflict between artistic creation and responsible parenting.  With searing emotional honesty and an incisive examination of cultural mores within patriarchal societies, Shafak has rendered an important work about literature, motherhood, and spiritual well-being.",,,12/29/07,April 28th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Feminism', 'Turkish Literature', 'Turkish', 'Autobiography', 'Womens', 'Writing', 'Contemporary']",,9780670022649,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311281806l/9923549.jpg,3.72,[],186.0,2.0,,9923549-black-milk,,,,,87.0,11385.0,267,,Viking,"['3145', '3866', '2861', '1101', '412']",,,['Turkey'],,

Birdie Cousins has thrown herself into the details of her daughter Chess's lavish wedding, from the floating dance floor in her Connecticut back yard to the color of the cocktail napkins. Like any mother of a bride-to-be, she is weathering the storms of excitement and chaos, tears and joy. But Birdie, a woman who prides herself on preparing for every possibility, could never have predicted the late-night phone call from Chess, abruptly announcing that she's cancelled her engagement.  It's only the first hint of what will be a summer of upheavals and revelations. Before the dust has even begun to settle, far worse news arrives, sending Chess into a tailspin of despair. Reluctantly taking a break from the first new romance she's embarked on since the recent end of her 30-year marriage, Birdie circles the wagons and enlists the help of her younger daughter Tate and her own sister India. Soon all four are headed for beautiful, rustic Tuckernuck Island, off the coast of Nantucket, where their family has summered for generations. No phones, no television, no grocery store - a place without distractions where they can escape their troubles.

"Elio Vittorini, Alane Salierno Mason (Translator), Ernest Hemingway (Foreword)",Conversations in Sicily,,English,,"Vittorini's Conversations in Sicily stands as a modern classic, not only for its powerful thematic resonance as one of the great novels of Italian anti-fascism but also as a trailblazer for its style, which blends literary modernism with the pre-modern fable in a prose of lyric beauty. Comparing Vittorini's work to Picasso's, Italo Calvino described Conversations as ""the book-Guernica.""The novel begins at a time in the narrator's life when nothing seems to matter; whether he is reading newspaper posters blaring of wartime massacres, lying in bed with his wife or girlfriend, or flipping through the pages of a dictionary it is all the same to him—until he embarks on a journey back to Sicily, the home he has not seen in some fifteen years. In traveling through the Sicilian countryside and in variously hilarious and tragic conversations with its people—his indomitable mother in particular—he reconnects with his roots and rediscovers some basic human values.In the introduction Hemingway wrote for the American debut of Conversations (published as In Sicily by New Directions in 1949) he remarked: ""I care very much about Vittorini's ability to bring rain with him when he comes, if the earth is dry and that is what you need."" More recently, American critic Donald Heiney wrote that in this one book, Vittorini ""like Rabelais and Cervantes...adds a new artistic dimension to the history of literature.""",,,11/06/37,December 17th 2000,['Silvestro Ferrauto'],Paperback,"['Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'Travel', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Read For School']",,9780811214551,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348212366l/1165806.jpg,3.72,[],49.0,1.0,,1165806.Conversations_in_Sicily,,,,,88.0,1803.0,202,,New Directions,"['449', '662', '479', '166', '47']",,,['Sicily (Italy)'],,

First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.",,,,2000.0,,,,0805065377,9780805065374,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kQZYiLOJ8KYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,4.02,,,,,,,,,,,,336.0,,,,8287.0,,,,

In a nearby village, their wives waited to hear from them. The news they received - all five missionaries had been murdered - changed lives around the world forever. Written while she was still a missionary in South America and at the request of the men's families, Through Gates of Splendor was Elisabeth Elliot's personal account of the final mission of these five courageous men.

Elizabeth Bard,"Lunch in Paris: A Love Story, with Recipes",,English,,"In Paris for a weekend visit, Elizabeth Bard sat down to lunch with a handsome Frenchman--and never went home again. Was it love at first sight? Or was it the way her knife slid effortlessly through her pave au poivre, the steak's pink juices puddling into the buttery pepper sauce? Lunch In Paris is a memoir about a young American woman caught up in two passionate love affairs--one with her new beau, Gwendal, the other with French cuisine. Packing her bags for a new life in the world's most romantic city, Elizabeth is plunged into a world of bustling open-air markets, hipster bistros, and size 2 femmes fatales. She learns to gut her first fish (with a little help from Jane Austen), soothe pangs of homesickness (with the rise of a chocolate souffle) and develops a crush on her local butcher (who bears a striking resemblance to Matt Dillon). Elizabeth finds that the deeper she immerses herself in the world of French cuisine, the more Paris itself begins to translate. French culture, she discovers, is not unlike a well-ripened cheese-there may be a crusty exterior, until you cut through to the melting, piquant heart. Peppered with mouth-watering recipes for summer ratatouille, swordfish tartare and molten chocolate cakes, Lunch in Paris is a story of falling in love, redefining success and discovering what it truly means to be at home.

Ginny Young is on a plane, en route to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen or spoken to for thirty-five years. She thinks back to the summer of 1958, when she and her sister, Sharla, were young girls. At that time, a series of dramatic events--beginning with the arrival of a mysterious and sensual next-door neighbor--divided the family, separating the sisters from their mother. Moving back and forth in time between the girl she once was and the woman she's become, Ginny at last confronts painful choices that occur in almost any woman's life, and learns surprising truths about the people she thought she knew best. Emotional honesty and a true understanding of people and relationships are combined in this moving and deeply satisfying new book by the novelist who ""writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, love and hope. And the transcendence that redeems"" (Andre Dubus).",,,1998,May 25th 1999,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Womens Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Family', 'Relationships', 'Book Club']",,9780345423290,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925334l/226858.jpg,3.91,[],17.0,1.0,,226858.What_We_Keep,,,,,96.0,15840.0,304,,Ballantine Books,"['4215', '6797', '4167', '560', '101']",,,['United States of America'],,

Elizabeth Berg,We Are All Welcome Here,,English,,"Elizabeth Berg, bestselling author of The Art of Mending and The Year of Pleasures, has a rare talent for revealing her characters' hearts and minds in a manner that makes us empathize completely. Her new novel, We Are All Welcome Here, features three women, each struggling against overwhelming odds for her own kind of freedom.It is the summer of 1964. In Tupelo, Mississippi, the town of Elvis's birth, tensions are mounting over civil-rights demonstrations occurring ever more frequently-and violently-across the state. But in Paige Dunn's small, ramshackle house, there are more immediate concerns. Challenged by the effects of the polio she contracted during her last month of pregnancy, Paige is nonetheless determined to live as normal a life as possible and to raise her daughter, Diana, in the way she sees fit-with the support of her tough-talking black caregiver, Peacie.Diana is trying in her own fashion to live a normal life. As a fourteen-year-old, she wants to make money for clothes and magazines, to slough off the authority of her mother and Peacie, to figure out the puzzle that is boys, and to escape the oppressiveness she sees everywhere in her small town. What she can never escape, however, is the way her life is markedly different from others'. Nor can she escape her ongoing responsibility to assist in caring for her mother. Paige Dunn is attractive, charming, intelligent, and lively, but her needs are great-and relentless. As the summer unfolds, hate and adversity will visit this modest home.

Elizabeth Bishop,The Complete Poems 1927-1979,,English,,"Elizabeth Bishop was vehement about her art--a perfectionist who didn't want to be seen as a ""woman poet."" In 1977, two years before her death she wrote, ""art is art and to separate writings, paintings, musical compositions, etc., into two sexes is to emphasize values in them that are not art."" She also deeply distrusted the dominant mode of modern poetry, one practiced with such detached passion by her friend Robert Lowell, the confessional.  Bishop was unforgiving of fashion and limited ways of seeing and feeling, but cast an even more trenchant eye on her own work. One wishes this volume were thicker, though the perfections within mark the rightness of her approach. The poems are sublimely controlled, fraught with word play, fierce moral vision (see her caustic ballad on Ezra Pound, ""Visits to St. Elizabeths""), and reticence. From the surreal sorrow of the early ""Man-Moth"" (leaping off from a typo she had come across for ""mammoth""), about a lonely monster who rarely emerges from ""the pale subways of cement he calls his home,"" to the beauty of her villanelle ""One Art"" (with its repeated ""the art of losing isn't hard to master""), the poet wittily explores distance and desolation, separation and sorrow.",,,11/06/80,1984,[],Paperback,"['Poetry', 'Classics', 'American', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Fiction', 'The United States Of America', 'Female Authors', 'Read For School', 'College']",,9780374518172,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436422208l/420278._SY475_.jpg,4.19,[],84.0,1.0,,420278.The_Complete_Poems_1927_1979,,,,,94.0,11739.0,287,,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","['5713', '3515', '1830', '441', '240']",,,[],,
Elizabeth Borton de Treviño,"I, Juan de Pareja",,English,,"When the great Velázquez was painting his masterpieces at the Spanish court in the seventeenth century, his colors were expertly mixed and his canvases carefully prepared by his slave, Juan de Pareja. In a vibrant novel which depicts both the beauty and the cruelty of the time and place, Elizabeth Borton de Treviño tells the story of Juan, who was born a slave and died an accomplished and respected artist.Upon the death of his indulgent mistress in Seville, Juan de Pareja was uprooted from the only home he had known and placed in the charge of a vicious gypsy muleteer to be sent north to his mistress's nephew and heir, Diego Velázquez, who recognized at once the intelligence and gentle breeding which were to make Juan his indispensable assistant and companion—and his lifelong friend.Through Juan's eyes the reader sees Velázquez's delightful family, his working habits and the character of the man, his relations with the shy yet devoted King Philip IV and with his fellow painters, Rubens and Murillo, the climate and customs of Spanish court life. When Velázquez discovers that he and Juan share a love for the art which is his very life, the painter proves his friendship in the most incredible fashion, for in those days it was forbidden by law for slaves to learn or practice the arts. Through the hardships of voyages to Italy, through the illnesses of Velázquez, Juan de Pareja loyally serves until the death of the painter in 1660.I, Juan de Pareja is the winner of the 1966 Newbery Medal.Latino Interest.",,,06/01/65,April 29th 2008,"['Diego Velázquez', 'Juan de Pareja']",Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Art', 'Childrens', 'Historical', 'Spain', 'School', 'Middle Grade', 'Classics']",,9780312380052,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316131529l/3950400.jpg,3.74,"['Newbery Medal (1966)', ""Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award Nominee (1967)""]",97.0,1.0,,3950400-i-juan-de-pareja,,,,,87.0,7732.0,192,,Square Fish,"['2305', '2429', '2015', '640', '343']",,,['Spain'],,

Elizabeth Brundage,All Things Cease to Appear,,English,,"A dark, riveting, beautifully written book—by “a brilliant novelist” according to Richard Bausch—that combines noir and the gothic in a story about two families entwined in their own unhappiness, with, at its heart, a gruesome and unsolved murder.Late one winter afternoon in upstate New York, George Clare comes home to find his wife killed and their three-year-old daughter alone—for how many hours?—in her room across the hall. He had recently, begrudgingly, taken a position at a nearby private college (far too expensive for local kids to attend) teaching art history, and moved his family into a tight-knit, impoverished town that has lately been discovered by wealthy outsiders in search of a rural idyll.George is of course the immediate suspect—the question of his guilt echoing in a story shot through with secrets both personal and professional. While his parents rescue him from suspicion, a persistent cop is stymied at every turn in proving Clare a heartless murderer. And three teenage brothers (orphaned by tragic circumstances) find themselves entangled in this mystery, not least because the Clares had moved into their childhood home, a once-thriving dairy farm. The pall of death is ongoing, and relentless; behind one crime there are others, and more than twenty years will pass before a hard kind of justice is finally served. A rich and complex portrait of a psychopath and a marriage, this is also an astute study of the various taints that can scar very different families, and even an entire community.

Elizabeth Flock (Goodreads Author),Me & Emma,,English,,"The title characters in Me & Emma are very nearly photographic opposites--8-year-old Carrie, the raven-haired narrator, is timid and introverted, while her little sister Emma is a tow-headed powerhouse with no sense of fear. The girls live in a terrible situation: they depend on an unstable mother that has never recovered from her husband's murder, their stepfather beats them regularly, and they must forage on their own for food.  Stop here and you have a story told many times before, as fiction and nonfiction in tales like Ellen Foster, or I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings --stories in which a young girl reveals the horrors of her childhood. Me & Emma differentiates itself with a spectacular finish, shocking the reader and turning the entire story on its head.

This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction.In North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.",,Penguin Popular Classics,01/28/55,01/13/94,"['Margaret Hale', 'Frederick Hale', 'Mr. Hale', 'Mrs. Hale', 'Mr. Bell', 'Dixon', 'Mrs. Hannah Thornton', 'Fanny Thornton', 'Bessy Higgins', 'Nicholas Higgins', 'John   Thornton']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', '19th Century', 'Victorian', 'Literature', 'British Literature', 'Historical Romance']",,9780140620191,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349633381l/156538.jpg,4.13,[],18164.0,234.0,,156538.North_and_South,,,,,94.0,143583.0,521,,Penguin Books,"['62990', '48627', '22866', '5989', '3111']",,,['England'],,

Through a series of vignettes, Elizabeth Gaskell portrays a community governed by old-fashioned habits and dominated by friendships between women. Her wry account of rural life is undercut, however, by tragedy in its depiction of such troubling events as Matty's bankruptcy, the violent death of Captain Brown or the unwitting cruelty of Peter Jenkyns. Written with acute observation, Cranford is by turns affectionate, moving and darkly satirical.In her introduction, Patricia Ingham discusses Cranford in relation to Gaskell's own past and as a work of irony in the manner of Jane Austen. She also considers the implications of the novel in terms of class and empire.

But as they begin to unlock the secrets of this closed society, the investigation into Matthew's death leads them perilously close to their own emotional wounds--and blinds them to the signs of another murder in the making....From the Paperback edition.",Inspector Lynley #3,,10/29/89,May 1st 2007,"['Thomas Lynley', 'Barbara Havers', 'Simon St. James', 'Deborah St. James', 'Matthew Whateley']",Paperback,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Thriller', 'Detective', 'British Literature', 'Adult', 'Suspense', 'Murder Mystery']",,9780553384819,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389348416l/394228.jpg,4.12,[],194.0,3.0,,394228.Well_Schooled_in_Murder,,,,,97.0,22172.0,432,,Bantam,"['7995', '9604', '3965', '447', '161']",,,"['West Sussex, England (United Kingdom)']",,

Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton, has brought to Howenstow, his family home, the young woman he has asked to be his bride. But the savage murder of a local journalist is the catalyst for a lethal series of events that shatters the calm of a picturesque Cornwall village and embroils Lynley and St. James in a case far outside their jurisdiction—and a little too close to home.

But when he opens an innocuous-looking letter addressed to him at The Source, he discovers that someone else excels at ferreting out secrets as well.Ten-year-old Charlotte Bowen has been abducted, and if Luxford does not admit publicly to having fathered her, she will die. But Charlotte's existence is Luxford's most fiercely guarded secret, and acknowledging her as his child will throw more than one life and career into chaos. Luxford knows that the story of Charlotte's paternity could make him a laughingstock and reveal to his beautiful wife and son the lie he's lived for a decade. Yet it's not only Luxford's reputation that's on the line: it's also the reputation—and career—of Charlotte Bowen's mother. For she is Undersecretary of State for the Home Office, one of the most high-profile Junior Ministers and quite possibly the next Margaret Thatcher.Knowing that her political future hangs in the balance, Eve Bowen refuses to let Luxford damage her career by printing the story or calling the police. So the editor turns to forensic scientist Simon St. James for help. It's a case that fills St. James with disquiet, however, for none of the players in the drama seem to react the way one would expect.Then tragedy occurs and New Scotland Yard becomes involved.

Elizabeth George (Goodreads Author),A Traitor to Memory,,English,,"When Eugenie Davies is killed by a driver on a quiet London street, her death is clearly no accident. Someone struck her with a car and then deliberately ran over her body before driving off, leaving nothing behind but questions. What brought Eugenie Davies to London on a rainy autumn night? Why was she carrying the name of the man who found her body? Who among the many acquaintances in her complicated and tragic life could have wanted her dead? And could her murder have some connection to a twenty-eight-year-old musical wunderkind, a virtuoso violinist who several months earlier suddenly and inexplicably lost the ability to play a single note? For Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, whose own domestic life is about to change radically, these questions are only the first in an investigation that leads him to walk a fine line between personal loyalty and professional honor. Assigned to the case by his superior, Superintendent Malcolm Webberly, Lynley learns that Webberly's first murder investigation as a DI over twenty years ago involved Eugenie Davies and a sensational criminal trial. Yet what is truly damaging is what Webberly already knows and no doubt wants Lynley to keep concealed. Now the pressure is on Lynley to find Eugenie Davies' killer. For not only is he putting his own career into jeopardy, but he is also attempting to safeguard the careers of his longtime partners Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata.

Elizabeth George (Goodreads Author),A Place of Hiding,,English,,"An isolated beach on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel is the scene of the murder of Guy Brouard, one of Guernsey's wealthiest inhabitants and its main benefactor. Forced as a child to flee the Nazis in Paris, Brouard was engaged in his latest project when he died: a museum in honor of those who resisted the German occupation of the island during World War II. It is from this period of time that his murderer may well have come. But there are others on Guernsey with reason to want Guy Brouard dead: his wives, his business associates, his current mistress, the underprivileged teenagers he mentored--any of whom might have harbored a secret motive for murder. As family and friends gather for the reading of the will, Deborah and Simon St. James find that seemingly everyone on the history-haunted island has something to hide. And behind all the lies and alibis, a killer is lurking. In order to bring this person to justice, the St. James must delve into Guernsey's dark history--both past and present--and into the troubled psyche of someone who may have exacted retribution for the most unspeakable crime of all. In A Place of Hiding, bestselling novelist Elizabeth George marks new territory in the darker landscapes of human relationships. She tells a gripping, suspenseful story of betrayal and devotion, war and remembrance, love and loss...and the higher truths to which we must all ultimately answer.

Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author),"Eat, Pray, Love",,English,,"A celebrated writer's irresistible, candid, and eloquent account of her pursuit of worldly pleasure, spiritual devotion, and what she really wanted out of life. Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration.

Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author),Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage,,English,,"At the end of her bestselling memoir Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert fell in love with Felipe, a Brazilian-born man of Australian citizenship who'd been living in Indonesia when they met. Resettling in America, the couple swore eternal fidelity to each other, but also swore to never, ever, under any circumstances get legally married. (Both were survivors of previous bad divorces. Enough said.) But providence intervened one day in the form of the United States government, which-after unexpectedly detaining Felipe at an American border crossing-gave the couple a choice: they could either get married, or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again. Having been effectively sentenced to wed, Gilbert tackled her fears of marriage by delving into this topic completely, trying with all her might to discover through historical research, interviews, and much personal reflection what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. Told with Gilbert's trademark wit, intelligence and compassion, Committed attempts to ""turn on all the lights"" when it comes to matrimony, frankly examining questions of compatibility, infatuation, fidelity, family tradition, social expectations, divorce risks and humbling responsibilities. Gilbert's memoir is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of love with all the complexity and consequence that real love, in the real world, actually entails.",,,12/28/09,January 5th 2010,"['Felipe', 'Liz Gilbert', 'Elizabeth Gilbert']",Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Relationships', 'Biography', 'Marriage', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Travel']",,9780670021659,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472258183l/6728738.jpg,3.42,[],382.0,5.0,,6728738-committed,,,,,82.0,49225.0,285,,Riverhead Books,"['8464', '15375', '16315', '6690', '2381']",,,[],,
Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author),The Signature of All Things,,English,,"A glorious, sweeping novel of desire, ambition, and the thirst for knowledge, from the # 1 New York Times bestselling author of Eat, Pray, Love and Committed.In The Signature of All Things, Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction, inserting her inimitable voice into an enthralling story of love, adventure and discovery. Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker—a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction — into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist — but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe—from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who — born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution — bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.",,,,October 1st 2013,[],Hardcover,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Nature', 'Adult', 'Book Club']",,9780670024858,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560901426l/17465453._SY475_.jpg,3.84,"['Wellcome Book Prize Nominee for Shortlist (2014)', ""Women's Prize for Fiction Nominee for Longlist (2014)"", 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Fiction (2014)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2013)']",965.0,12.0,,17465453-the-signature-of-all-things,,,,,89.0,95897.0,501,,Riverhead Books,"['28977', '35580', '21156', '7163', '3021']",,,[],,

Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author),City of Girls,,English,,"""Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.""Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is."" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.",,,06/06/19,April 7th 2020,[],Paperback,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Romance', 'Book Club', 'Contemporary', 'Novels']",,9781594634741,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583203648l/51918871.jpg,4.04,"['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Historical Fiction (2019)', 'HWA Gold Crown Nominee for Longlist (2020)']",93.0,1.0,,51918871-city-of-girls,,,,,95.0,157326.0,496,,Riverhead Books,"['55365', '63897', '29568', '6505', '1991']",,,"['New York City, New York (United States)', 'Manhattan, New York City, New York (United States)']",,

It was a gray day in early April when Michael stumbled wearily into the tiny English village. Weighed down by failure and despair, the town of Silverbridge seems too offer him a quiet, rural escape from the past. Even though his heart was torn by remorse and shame, he was home at last.Kind, gentle vicar John Wentworth takes Michael under his wing, and introduces him to his family and friends. At the vicarage, John's inexplicably discontented wife Daphne brings up their daughters. Bedridden Harriet, John's former nanny, deals impatiently with a world to which she cannot actively participate. At the family home, Belmaray Manor, Great Aunt Maria is burdened by the worry of a failing estate. And at the grim little town school is fiery teacher Mary O'Hara, determined to foster change.With Michaels' arrival at Belmaray, changes began to occur in lives that had not changed for so long: the proud, self-centered beauty he had once loved was surprised into forgiveness; the quixotic bumbling vicar discovered unsuspected strength lurking behind his shyness; a sick and lonely spinster was turned away from despair, and a lovely, high-spirited young woman found her heart's desire.

Elizabeth Hay,Late Nights on Air,,English,,"The eagerly anticipated novel from the bestselling author of A Student of Weather and Garbo Laughs. Harry Boyd, a hard-bitten refugee from failure in Toronto television, has returned to a small radio station in the Canadian North. There, in Yellowknife, in the summer of 1975, he falls in love with a voice on air, though the real woman, Dido Paris, is both a surprise and even more than he imagined. Dido and Harry are part of the cast of eccentric, utterly loveable characters, all transplants from elsewhere, who form an unlikely group at the station. Their loves and longings, their rivalries and entanglements, the stories of their pasts and what brought each of them to the North, form the centre. One summer, on a canoe trip four of them make into the Arctic wilderness (following in the steps of the legendary Englishman John Hornby, who, along with his small party, starved to death in the barrens in 1927), they find the balance of love shifting, much as the balance of power in the North is being changed by the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline, which threatens to displace Native people from their land.Elizabeth Hay has been compared to Annie Proulx, Alice Hoffman, and Isabel Allende, yet she is uniquely herself. With unforgettable characters, vividly evoked settings, in this new novel, Hay brings to bear her skewering intelligence into the frailties of the human heart and her ability to tell a spellbinding story.

At the worst of the Prairie dust bowl of the 1930s, a young man appears out of a blizzard and forever alters the lives of two sisters. There is the beautiful, fastidious Lucinda, and the tricky and tenacious Norma Joyce, at first a strange, self-possessed child, later a woman who learns something of self-forgiveness and of the redemptive nature of art. Their rivalry sets the stage for all that follows in a narrative spanning over thirty years, beginning in Saskatchewan and moving, in the decades following the war, to Ottawa and New York City.

At the same moment of this portentous arrival, two gatherings of great import are taking place. The first is a convocation of dragons, who gather in a primeval forest glade--the site of the horrific ending of Llauron, one of the last of their kind.

"Elizabeth Haydon, Brett Helquist (Illustrator)",The Floating Island,,English,,"Long ago, in the Second Age of history, a young Nain explorer by the name of Ven Polypheme traveled much of the known and unknown world, recording his adventures. Recently discovered by archaeologists, a few fragments of his original journals are reproduced in this book. Great care has been taken to reconstruct the parts of the journal that did not survive, so that a whole story can be told...Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme--known as Ven--is the youngest son of a long line of famous shipwrights. He dreams not of building ships, but of sailing them to far-off lands where magic thrives. Ven gets his chance when he is chosen to direct the Inspection of his family's latest ship--and sets sail on the journey of a lifetime. Attacked by fire pirates, lost at sea and near death, Ven is rescued by a passing ship on its way to the Island of Serendair. Thankful to be alive, little does Ven know that the pirate attack--and his subsequent rescue--may not have been an accident. Shadowy figures are hunting for the famed Floating Island, the only source of the mystical Water of Life. They think Ven can lead them to this treasure, and will stop at nothing to get it--even murder. In a narrative that alternates entries from his journals and drawings from his sketchbooks, Ven begins the famous chronicles of his exciting and exotic adventures--adventures that would later earn him renown as the author of The Book of All Human Knowledge and All the World's Magic.

Elizabeth Jane Howard,Falling,,English,,"To the delight of her many readers, Elizabeth Jane Howard has been producing prose of a subtlety, intelligence and feeling that has rarely faltered during the 50 years she has been writing. She is able to successfully straddle the disparate worlds of the popular and literary novel and this new book is among her most accomplished. Choosing a cynical and compromised first-person narrator, Howard introduces us to Henry Kent--a man looking for a woman --- preferably one with a little money. Henry, in late middle age, is living without means on a dank houseboat. Getting by on his charm is no longer feasible and when writer Daisy Langrish buys a cottage close by, he sets his sights on her. But those around Daisy --- her agent, her daughter--begin to ask questions about him. And the revelations they uncover have them very worried indeed. With a tone reminiscent of William Trevor, this is Howard at her most psychologically perceptive: her subject here is nothing less than an ambitious exploration of love, dealing in a dispassionate way with both the joys and the dangers. She demonstrates that the need to be first in someone's affections is a seductive but risky business and her powerful rendering of human emotion has the same scalpel-like precision as The Cazalet Chronicle. Many regard the latter as Howard's finest book, but this new volume is likely to change perceptions. Henry is fascinatingly characterised (we are allowed a nicely ambiguous attitude to him) and the slow but assured unwinding of the narrative grips with memorable force. --Barry Forshaw",,,11/06/99,May 1st 2000,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction']",,9780330368896,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348940526l/701488.jpg,3.89,[],57.0,1.0,,701488.Falling,,,,,93.0,561.0,422,,MacMillan General Books,"['168', '219', '134', '27', '13']",,,[],,

Elizabeth Kerner,Redeeming the Lost,,English,,"The prophecies are coming true and the ancient race of the Kantri-or true dragons-have come back to the world of Men. It was through the actions of Young Lanen Kaelar that the Kantri were reminded of the larger world. It was bravery (and a mad belief in the old tales) that caused the young woman to start a perilous journey to find the great dragons of legend. In doing so, she found not only the reality of the myth but her own true love. He was the great Dragon King, an immensely powerful creature out of time who ultimately chose life over death, a puny mortal form rather than the power of a kingship to be with this most extraordinary woman. As he is Dragon in Man's form, the being known as Varien has risked much to stay by Lanen's side. Their haven destroyed, the Kantri have chosen instead of seeking a new home to return to the land of their greatest defeat and to the fear of the people who rejected their aid so long ago. They bring ancient power and knowledge and the Kantri have come to see what the ""littlings"" have made of their world. And much of what they find distresses them. For humans have squandered much of their heritage, the small dragons that were left behind are little more than cattle...and there are those who do remember the ancient ways...and have allied themselves with the race of demons who long to destroy all the world. The Kantri are disturbed and look to Varien and Lanen help them redeem what has been lost so long ago and make the world right again.But Lanen is captured by the human demon-master Berys, who seeks to corrupt the ancient prophecy. He will try to use Lanen's new-found powers to gain control of the very fabric of the universe and in doing so, secure the demon forces of the otherworld and rule forever.It is up to her true love Varien and one of the most unlikely alliances ever seen to rescue Lanen. And if Varien fails, not only will Lanen's life and the fates of his beloved Kantri hang in the balance. For the stage is now set for a confrontation between the forces of light and darkness...and if the good fail, not only will the Kantri fail but the human world will be doomed as well...",The Tale of Lanen Kaelar #3,,06/01/04,November 29th 2005,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Romance', 'Fiction', 'High Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy Romance', 'Adult']",,9780812568769,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388525591l/734747.jpg,4.12,[],68.0,1.0,,734747.Redeeming_the_Lost,,,,,95.0,1552.0,400,,Tor Fantasy,"['644', '529', '306', '62', '11']",,,[],,

Wells-Barnett (1862-1928) fought to end discrimination and the terrible crime of lynching and helped found the NAACP, but became known as a difficult woman for her refusal to compromise and was largely lost in the annals of history.*Gertrude Bell (1868-1926) had a passion for archaeology and languages, and left her privileged world behind to become one of the foremost chroniclers of British imperialism in the Middle East, and one of the architects of the modern nation of Iraq.",,,01/04/11,March 1st 2011,"['Eleanor of Aquitaine', 'Cleopatra', 'Frida Kahlo', ""Rose O'Neal Greenhow"", 'Émilie du Châtelet', 'Ida B.

Elizabeth Knox (Goodreads Author),"Here Kitty, Kitty",,English,,"Kat: Life always finds a way to fuck you over.  I found that one out the hard way before I was even thirteen. Before that, my life had been perfect and then I was stripped away from my family. And while it certainly wasn’t what you’d call the typical family, it had been my family, my life. I had everything: loving parents, a huge biker family (even though they did fight like cat and dogs a lot), and the love from every member of one of the most notorious clubs in United States history. The Reapers blood flew through every vein in my body.  It took my years to find out why—or better who—had stripped me of my life, never knowing who the man was that’d taken everything from me. But he certainly knew who I was and, more importantly, he knew my parents. He took me hostage just to get back at my parents for something that had happened years ago.  I was the price my parents paid. Worst of all, I’ve been stuck here for years. Nothing about my stay with the Demons of Hell motorcycle club is glorious, especially not with the things they say and worst of all, the things they force me to do. I started out as a girl full of light but having spent so much time in the dark has sucked almost every bit of light I had left.  Darkness was all I’d known until I met him, and he lit the last remaining ember I’d had left inside me.  Damon  When I agreed to go undercover at the Demons of Hell motorcycle club, I had no idea exactly what my father had been signing me up for.  My father’s personal gain had been my sole purpose. Growing up in the Brotherhood Motorcycle Club had given me a good idea of the club life but being thrown into Rage’s idea of a club was something that nobody could’ve prepared me for.  Four years in this club and I’d learned next to nothing. Every day, I could feel myself getting closer to the information my father sent me for, that my family needed. My father had abandoned everything, and it had all been Rage’s fault. Even so, my father had vowed to return, to right every and all wrongdoing that Rage had had a hand in and he would fulfill that promise.  And while I may have come here for my father’s bidding, that wasn’t the reason I’d decided to stay. I could’ve made the choice a long time ago to run back home, to return even if it was with nothing useful. Every single day that I’m here, I stare in the face of the person I’ve decided to stay for. Her face screams how lost and broken she is, how she’s had everything ripped from her by him. Rage calls her his property and I’m letting him think that for now.  If only he knew about the way she looks at me whenever she’s not in his sight…",Reapers MC #2,,,October 6th 2018,[],Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Abuse', 'Erotica', 'Dark']",,B07J3ZRG9C,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1538914076l/42202166._SY475_.jpg,4.22,[],93.0,1.0,,42202166-here-kitty-kitty,,,,,94.0,835.0,214,,Knox Publishing,"['415', '251', '118', '42', '9']",,,[],,
Elizabeth Kolbert,The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History,,English,,"Over the last half-billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, The New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes.

Elizabeth Kostova,The Historian,,English,,"To you, perceptive reader, I bequeath my history....Late one night, exploring her father's library, a young woman finds an ancient book and a cache of yellowing letters. The letters are all addressed to ""My dear and unfortunate successor,"" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.",,,,06/01/05,"['Bartholomew Rossi', 'Helen Rossi', 'Dracula']",Kindle Edition,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Vampires', 'Historical', 'Paranormal', 'Gothic', 'Thriller']",,B000FCK6EI,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592232171l/30236962._SY475_.jpg,3.79,"['International Horror Guild Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)', 'Hopwood Award for Novel in-progress (2003)', 'Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Best Adult Fiction (2006)', 'The Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year (2005)', 'Lord Ruthven Award for Fiction (2006)']",44792.0,542.0,,30236962-the-historian,,,,,87.0,242366.0,704,,"Little, Brown and Company","['75804', '80135', '55143', '21396', '9888']",,,"['Europe', 'Amsterdam (Netherlands)']",,

Into the rarefied atmosphere of wealth and tradition comes the most unlikely of horses—a drab white former plow horse named Snowman—and his rider, Harry de Leyer. They were the longest of all longshots—and their win was the stuff of legend. Harry de Leyer first saw the horse he would name Snowman on a bleak winter afternoon between the slats of a rickety truck bound for the slaughterhouse. He recognized the spark in the eye of the beaten-up horse and bought him for eighty dollars. On Harry’s modest farm on Long Island, the horse thrived. But the recent Dutch immigrant and his growing family needed money, and Harry was always on the lookout for the perfect thoroughbred to train for the show-jumping circuit—so he reluctantly sold Snowman to a farm a few miles down the road. But Snowman had other ideas about what Harry needed. When he turned up back at Harry’s barn, dragging an old tire and a broken fence board, Harry knew that he had misjudged the horse. And so he set about teaching this shaggy, easygoing horse how to fly. One show at a time, against extraordinary odds and some of the most expensive thoroughbreds alive, the pair climbed to the very top of the sport of show jumping. Here is the dramatic and inspiring rise to stardom of an unlikely duo, based on the insight and recollections of “the Flying Dutchman” himself. Their story captured the heart of Cold War–era America—a story of unstoppable hope, inconceivable dreams, and the chance to have it all. Elizabeth Letts’s message is simple: Never give up, even when the obstacles seem sky-high.

Elizabeth Maguire,The Open Door,,English,,"“The story is the journey, not the destination. Or so the philosopher’s say. But this is my story, and it has a beginning, a middle, and an end….”The Open Door is a luminous and profoundly moving novel inspired by the life of Constance Fenimore Woolson, one of the most widely-read and respected American authors of the nineteenth century. Exploring themes of passion, life, death, friendship, and art, the novel is a vivid evocation of the complex forces behind literary creation.After years of supporting her mother and a hapless brother through her writing, Constance finds herself in early middle age “hungry, ravenous to see and live as much as possible.” She sails for Europe with a letter of introduction to Henry James, the writer she admires above all others. Constance is intoxicated by Europe, Italy in particular, and she and James eventually meet in Florence. James is delighted by this highly intelligent, independent woman (whom he dubs “Fenimore” as a sign of his esteem) and makes her his confidante. For her part, Constance finds with James “the unequalled joy of never running out of things to say.”Constance’s courageous, open nature is odds with James’s more secretive one and inevitably leads to friction, transgression, and revenge both private and public. Elegantly conceived and life-affirming, The Open Door is an unforgettable portrait of a remarkable woman who lived with passion and refused to accept the narrowing of her world.",,,2008,June 10th 2008,[],Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Books About Books', 'Adult Fiction']",,9781590512838,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320530520l/2728741.jpg,3.4,[],25.0,1.0,,2728741-the-open-door,,,,,84.0,139.0,236,,Other Press,"['23', '37', '57', '16', '6']",,,[],,

The Scottish Highlands are well known for their mystical charms and tales of fantasy, yet very few have encountered the power of a Highland Stag, the magic of a Campbell crystal or the enchantment of a sprig of heather. Indeed, even those who dwell within the shadows of these formidable mountains are often unaware of their charms. In the early hours of February 13th 1692 the sulfurous smell of a fired gun hung in the air of these mountains. Men, women and children screamed in terror, withering against pain as they fell, bludgeoned to death by men of the army. The shameful scar of a dreadful and tragic event was etched upon the landscape of a beautiful and otherwise honorable place forever. Awoken by the sickly, metallic copper stink of fresh blood and death, Corran MacDonald is forced to flee into blizzard swept mountains. She mysteriously defies death only to come face to face with one of her enemies, Simon Campbell. With her family massacred and her village destroyed, Corran trusts the man when he offers to help her escape. But things aren't quite what they seem and very soon their bid for freedom is thwarted by Simon's old enemy and fellow Red Coat, Angus.

Two misfits whose lonely paths cross at the circulation desk, Peggy and James are odd candidates for friendship, but nevertheless they soon find their lives entwined in ways that neither one could have predicted.

Elizabeth Moon,Remnant Population,,English,,"For forty years, Colony 3245.12 has been Ofelia’s home. On this planet far away in space and time from the world of her youth, she has lived and loved, weathered the death of her husband, raised her one surviving child, lovingly tended her garden, and grown placidly old. And it is here that she fully expects to finish out her days–until the shifting corporate fortunes of the Sims Bancorp Company dictates that Colony 3245.12 is to be disbanded, its residents shipped off, deep in cryo-sleep, to somewhere new and strange and not of their choosing. But while her fellow colonists grudgingly anticipate a difficult readjustment on some distant world, Ofelia savors the promise of a golden opportunity. Not starting over in the hurly-burly of a new community... but closing out her life in blissful solitude, in the place she has no intention of leaving. A population of one.With everything she needs to sustain her, and her independent spirit to buoy her, Ofelia actually does start life over–for the first time on her own terms: free of the demands, the judgments, and the petty tyrannies of others.

Elizabeth Moon,The Speed of Dark,,English,,"In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use “please” and “thank you” and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music–with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world–shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a “normal”?There are intense pressures coming from the world around him–including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, The Speed of Dark is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.From the Hardcover edition.",,,10/28/02,June 28th 2005,['Lou Arrendale'],Paperback,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Psychology', 'Disability', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club']",,9780345481399,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320497793l/96063.jpg,4.0,"['Nebula Award for Best Novel (2003)', 'Arthur C.

As these states now attempt to reconstruct their national identities, the surviving victims of genocide struggle to come to terms with a world unhinged.Interviewing victims and aggressors, war orphans and war criminals, Serbian militiamen and NATO commanders, Neuffer explores the extent to which genocide erodes a nation's social and political environment, just as it destroys the individual lives of the aggressor's perceived enemies.

When she met her minister husband, North, she hung up her fins and moved with him to the Midwest. Thirty-six years later, a reunion of the Mermaids of Yesteryear brings Grendy and North back to Mermaid City, where they decide to purchase a second home.

So when Grendy suddenly goes missing, leaving only a cryptic note behind, her daughter, France, goes to Mermaid City to find out what happened.While taking over care of her erratic six-year-old nephew, Theo, who is most affected by Grendy’s disappearance, France explores the odd circles her mother moved in.

But when a horrific car accident takes the life of his best friend and leaves him badly injured, his life will never be the same. With physical injuries that are so severely disabling that his dream of playing professional baseball is all but extinguished, he begins to spiral into emotional turmoil.In the depths of despair, Jarrod can’t seem to climb out of his depression, even as his body begins to heal. That is until he meets Angelise Skyler. Like a light from heaven, Angel, as he likes to call her, brings clarity, strength, and love back to Jarrod’s life, all while steering him back toward the path to a better life. But when Angel is taken from him, Jarrod will stop at nothing to bring her back safely. Forced into a desperate search through a menacing web of danger, Jarrod is led further into the unknown than he ever thought possible. But for Angel he’ll do anything, because he knows how lost he was before he met her, and more importantly, because she taught him that through love, faith, and perseverance, you can always find a way off the broken road.Jarrod and Angelise’s dramatic yet tender story in Broken Road is one that illustrates how important and encompassing love can be. Jarrod’s rise from the depths of depression at the hands of Angelise proves to be equally heartwarming and inspiring. Yet it’s the extremes that Jarrod will go to rescue his Angel that readers are truly shown the appreciation, devotion, and perseverance that he possesses inside. With rage and agonizing despair over losing his saving grace, Jarrod’s heroic efforts to bring her back make for a truly gripping experience. Its drama, despair, romance, and Jarrod’s inspiring ascension back from depression make this enchanting novel by Elizabeth Yu-Gesualdi possess a little something for everyone to appreciate and enjoy.Broken Road is a captivating romantic fiction novel that emphasizes the importance of faith, love, and perseverance. Geared towards a more mature young adult audience, the novel doesn’t hesitate to broach heavier themes than most other novels in the young adult genre. Filled with as much drama as romance, this engaging story has a crossover appeal that defies classification, and readers of all types will be hooked from the very beginning.Broken Road is Yu-Gesualdi’s debut novel. Originally from New Jersey, Yu-Gesualdi moved to Connecticut in 2005. For the past sixteen years, she has been a stay at home mother for her two sons, Jarrod and Alec.

Logan Mitchell is a man who’s always been more than happy to take what he wants. It’s a philosophy that’s proven lucrative in both his business and personal life, and never was it more apparent than the night he laid eyes on Tate Morrison. After pulling out all the stops and convincing the sexy bartender to give him a try—he’s hooked.

Ella Shohat (Editor),"Multiculturalism, Postcoloniality, and Transnational Media",,English,,"Reflecting the burgeoning academic interest in issues of nation, race, gender, sexuality, and other axes of identity, Multiculturalism, Postcoloniality, and Transnational Media brings all of these concerns under the same umbrella, contending that these issues must be discussed in relation to each other. Communities, societies, nations, and even entire continents, the book suggests, exist not autonomously but rather in a densely woven web of connectedness.To explore this complexity, the editors have forged links between usually compartmentalized fields (especially media studies, literary theory, visual culture, and critical anthropology) and areas of inquiry-particularly postcolonial and diasporic studies and a diverse set of ethnic and area studies. This book, which links all these issues in suggestive ways, provides an indispensable guide for students and scholars in a wide variety of disciplines. Essays in this groundbreaking volume include Julianne Burton-Carvajal on ethnic identity in Lone Star; Manthia Diawara on diasporic documentary; Hamid Naficy on independent transnational film genres; Robyn Wiegman on whiteness studies; Faye Ginsburg on indigenous media; and Jennifer Gonzßles on race in cyberspace; Ana M.

And the one that brings the pain is pure, white as snow... and standing in front of you.""One kiss could have changed Abby's life, but when it didn't happen, she ran. Jack was everything to her and when he didn't respond, Abby couldn't bear it. Everything about that night--leaning in close to his face, feeling the night breeze teasing her hair, the way his scent filled her head--was burned vividly into her mind, including the moment when Jack pulled away. There was no kiss. Abby was wrong. She was wrong about him, wrong about them. Maybe she didn't have to go to college two thousand miles away, but she did. She had to forget about him. Abby threw herself off the grid, disappearing completely from the life she knew. After completing her undergraduate degree, she enrolled in seminary. All contact with her old life was severed and she never looked back, until she was forced to.When Abby puts idealism into practice, her congregation throws her out. If she can survive a year on her own, they'll take her back, and continue to pay off her student loans--but if she fails, Abby is on her own with enough debt to fund a small town. Seminary wasn't cheap. With no place left to go, Abby returns to New York and her best friend takes her in. Desperate to make it on her own and prove she was right, Abby follows a job lead to an art studio on Long Island. It isn't until she hears Jack's voice that she freezes.

Abby left this life behind, but she's thrown back into it, head first. It's like someone hit rewind on her life and its ten years earlier.

Leda’s quest to gain the magic she needs to save her brother leads her to the castle of the Dragons, home of four soldiers in the Legion of Angels with extraordinary powers over the elements.

If you liked the movie ""Sleeping With the Enemy"", then you might like this story too. No one knew a woman lived there or that she even existed. A monster, living in darkness...At twenty-two, Nicole doesn't even look human anymore. The beast made sure of that. So she hides. A monster, consigned to a life of fear and solitude. This is all she deserves, she is quite sure of that.  And then one day out of the blue, the autographed baseball caught by Brian Jensen at the latest Marlins game enters her prison and manages to turn her world completely upside down.Temptation comes in the form of pity at first, and then perhaps something more. Does she dare to believe the things she's told, that this is not the life she was meant to live? That being a monster is not her forever-fate? And will she be willing to risk everything, to reach out and accept the helping hands around her and share her deepest, darkest secrets? She knows only too well that hands can hurt. Finding out whether they can also heal is a risky proposition, especially when the beast is still out there. Looking for her.Content warning: Violence, foul language, and adult situations. Not meant for younger readers. A note from Elle about this book: A really long time ago, I read an article in a newspaper or a magazine (I haven’t been able to locate the original) about a woman who was so badly beaten over a long period of time, she couldn’t leave her house. I thought about that woman a lot over the years and about what her thoughts might have been, her fears, her reality … and this book was my attempt to both exorcise those thoughts from my brain and also shed some light on a subject —domestic violence— that I feel should never be left in darkness.",,1st Edition,09/08/13,September 9th 2013,[],Kindle Edition,"['Romance', 'Abuse', 'Dark', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Suspense', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Drama', 'Adult']",,9781939455123,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369644035l/17981514.jpg,4.0,[],396.0,4.0,,17981514-don-t-make-me-beautiful,,,,,92.0,4802.0,370,,Elle Casey,"['1856', '1603', '965', '257', '121']",,,[],,

Those who turn to poetry to become confidants for another's stories and secrets will not be disappointed.”—Publishers Weekly“In her fifth book of poetry, Bass addresses everything from Saturn’s rings and Newton’s law of gravitation to wasps and Pablo Neruda. Her words are nostalgic, vivid, and visceral. Bass arrives at the truth of human carnality rooted in the extraordinary need and promise of the individual. Bass shows us that we are as radiant as we are ephemeral, that in transience glistens resilient history and the remarkable fluidity of connection. By the collection’s end—following her musings on suicide and generosity, desire and repetition—it becomes lucidly clear that Bass is not only a poet but also a philosopher and a storyteller.”—BooklistEllen Bass brings a deft touch as she continues her ongoing interrogations of crucial moral issues of our times, while simultaneously delighting in endearing human absurdities. From the start of Like a Beggar, Bass asks her readers to relax, even though ""bad things are going to happen,"" because the ""bad"" gets mined for all manner of goodness.From ""Another Story"":After dinner, we're drinking scotch at the kitchen table.Janet and I just watched a NOVA specialand we're explaining to her motherthe age and size of the universe—the hundred billion stars in the hundred billion galaxies.Dotty lives at Dominican Oaks, making her way down the long hall.How about the sun? she asks, a little farmshit in the endlessness.I gather up a cantaloupe, a lime, a cherry,and start revolving this salad around the chicken carcass.This is the best scotch I ever tasted, Dotty says,even though we gave her the Maker's Markwhile we're drinking Glendronach...Ellen Bass's poetry includes  Like A Beggar (Copper Canyon Press, 2014), The Human Line  (Copper Canyon Press, 2007), which was named a Notable Book by the San Francisco Chronicle, and Mules of Love (BOA, 2002), which won the Lambda Literary Award.  She co-edited (with Florence Howe) the groundbreaking No More Masks!

Ellen C. Maze (Goodreads Author),The Judging,,English,,"What happens when you want to do the will of God but are cursed for all eternity? Hungary, 1640. A village priest, enamored with his God and loyal to his sheep, awakens to find the village on fire. Searching for survivors, he is confronted by a dark creature with sharp teeth and red eyes. With the stab of the demon's fangs, the priest is transformed from a servant of good to an unwilling agent of evil. Present day. Four centuries pass, and Dr. Mark Corescu, that same village priest no longer recalls his origins. Corescu uses his position in the medical community to maintain a mortal facade as he pursues his true calling. Corescu seeks out evil men and women in a ritual he has dubbed the Judging. He condemns and kills them, one a night, feeding his lust on their blood. He feels neither guilt nor remorse. He believes he is serving a Higher Purpose. Artist and equestrian hobbyist Hope Brannen falls for the doctor at first sight. He feels the same, believing that she has been sent by God to aid him in his divine calling. Hope knows deep down he is not an agent of God but rather a real-life vampire. She turns to her seminary-going pal Tony Agricola for advice. As the story's only truly righteous character, Tony recognizes immediately that the doctor has incorrectly discerned the will of God. He agrees to speak to him about the matter, discovering that the doctor has suppressed his past. Slowly the doctor is reminded of his days as a humble village priest, as well as the time he spent in the clutches of the darkest creature imaginable. Steering the vampire down memory lane is difficult and risky but Tony does his best to correct the doctor's faulty theology. At the same time Corescu's perfect world is falling apart. Persevering through dangerous and perilous encounters with the vampire's immortal contemporaries, Tony shows the vampire the error of his ways.

But at a fated book signing that runs late into the night, Beth is confronted by an evil she'd only experienced in nightmares. Jack Dawn, a supernatural monster belonging to an ancient race of bloodthirsty immortals known as the Rakum, vows to track down and kill the young writer because of the vile redemptive message her book is bringing his people. The Rakum have spread evil among mankind since the Beginning, growing in strength and influence with every passing century. A respected Elder among his brethren, Jack recognizes the novel's destructive potential and his duty to destroy her before the book's promises annihilate his Kind. His method of subduing the novelist is an ancient punishment perpetrated against humans who bring them the ultimate displeasure; Jack marks her as a Rabbit. By forcing her to ingest his poisonous blood, Beth's body now regenerates endlessly and she is set free to be tracked by his hungry brethren. The plan? His people will torture her, slowly, night after night, until she goes insane. Marking her was easy - now Jack only has to sit back and wait for the Rakum to do their worst. Jack's proselyte Michael Stone was brought up from his youth to be strong, sensible and oftentimes, brutal. But at one hundred and thirty, Michael is old enough to appreciate the quiet and ordered life he'd carved out for himself over the years. Aware that his Elder has marked a human for death, Michael is on the lookout as he leaves work late one night. When he stumbles upon the beautiful and apparently innocent Beth Rider, he is instantly smitten, despite the fact that a few seconds later he realizes that she is the target of his Elder's fury. Puzzled by Jack's unreasonable condemnation, Michael takes it upon himself to protect the lovely author from the limitless lust of his brethren. Rakum grunt Javier - Millier was never one to question the Fathers nor doubt the word of the Elders but after reading a curiously odd vampire novel, he begins to doubt the understood deity of his race. Soon identified by Jack Dawn as a traitor, Javier goes on the run with Elder Roman and a mortal with a personal hidden agenda. They also are in pursuit of the book's author, although their intentions are quite dissimilar from those of their brethren. Facing the most terrifying trial of her life against creatures known only in fables, one simple woman will unintentionally threaten the very existence of a powerful and accursed people. In the climactic mle, it is a race to the death, or if Beth has her way, a race to the life-of every Rakum who makes the choice.",The Rabbit Saga #1,,11/13/09,,[],Kindle Edition,"['Horror', 'Vampires', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Christian Fiction', 'Religion', 'Young Adult']",,9780615678306,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328366697l/9991170.jpg,4.1,[],99.0,1.0,,9991170-rabbit,,,,,87.0,181.0,,,,"['99', '36', '22', '13', '11']",,,"['Tuscaloosa, Alabama (United States)', 'Jackson, Mississippi (United States)', 'Montgomery, Alabama (United States)']",,

"Ellen Willis, Nona Willis-Aronowitz (Goodreads Author) (Editor), Sasha Frere-Jones (Foreword), Daphne Carr (Afterword), Evie Nagy (Afterword)",Out of the Vinyl Deeps: On Rock Music,,English,,"In 1968, the New Yorker hired Ellen Willis as its first popular music critic. Her column, Rock, Etc., ran for seven years and established Willis as a leader in cultural commentary and a pioneer in the nascent and otherwise male-dominated field of rock criticism. As a writer for a magazine with a circulation of nearly half a million, Willis was also the country’s most widely read rock critic. With a voice at once sharp, thoughtful, and ecstatic, she covered a wide range of artists—Bob Dylan, The Who, Van Morrison, Elvis Presley, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Joni Mitchell, the Velvet Underground, Sam and Dave, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Wonder—assessing their albums and performances not only on their originality, musicianship, and cultural impact but also in terms of how they made her feel.Because Willis stopped writing about music in the early 1980s—when, she felt, rock ’n’ roll had lost its political edge—her significant contribution to the history and reception of rock music has been overshadowed by contemporary music critics like Robert Christgau, Lester Bangs, and Dave Marsh. Out of the Vinyl Deeps collects for the first time Willis’s Rock, Etc. columns and her other writings about popular music from this period (includingliner notes for works by Lou Reed and Janis Joplin) and reasserts her rightful place in rock music criticism.More than simply setting the record straight, Out of the Vinyl Deeps reintroduces Willis’s singular approach and style—her use of music to comment on broader social and political issues, critical acuity, vivid prose, against-the-grain opinions, and distinctly female (and feminist) perspective—to a new generation of readers. Featuring essays by the New Yorker’s current popular music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones, and cultural critics Daphne Carr and Evie Nagy, this volume also provides a lively and still relevant account of rock music during, arguably, its most innovative period.",,,04/06/11,May 1st 2011,[],Paperback,"['Music', 'Nonfiction', 'Essays', 'Pop Culture', 'Criticism', 'Art', 'Feminism', 'History', 'Journalism', 'Memoir']",,9780816672837,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328809754l/9796196.jpg,3.95,['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Criticism (2011)'],91.0,1.0,,9796196-out-of-the-vinyl-deeps,,,,,93.0,829.0,234,,Univ Of Minnesota Press,"['276', '315', '182', '33', '23']",,,[],,

Elliot Carlson,Joe Rochefort's War: The Odyssey of the Codebreaker Who Outwitted Yamamoto at Midway,,English,,"This is the first biography of Capt. Joe Rochefort, the Officer in Charge of Station Hypo the U.S. Navy's decrypt unit at Pearl Harbor and his key role in breaking the Imperial Japanese Navy's main code before the Battle of Midway. It brings together the disparate threads of Rochefort's life and career, beginning with his enlistment in the Naval Reserve in 1918 at age 17 (dropping out of high school and adding a year to his age). It chronicles his earliest days as a mustang (an officer who has risen from the ranks), his fortuitous posting to Washington, where he headed the Navy's codebreaking desk at age 25, then, in another unexpected twist, found himself assigned to Tokyo to learn Japanese.This biography records Rochefort's surprising love-hate relationship with cryptanalysis, his joyful exit from the field, his love of sea duty, his adventure-filled years in the '30s as the right-hand man to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, and his reluctant return to codebreaking in mid-1941 when he was ordered to head the Navy's decrypt unit at Pearl (Station Hypo). The book focuses on Rochefort's inspiring leadership of Hypo, recording first his frustrating months in late 1941 searching for Yamamoto's fleet, then capturing a guilt-ridden Rochefort in early 1942 mounting a redemptive effort to track that fleet after the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor . It details his critical role in May 1942 when he and his team, against the bitter opposition of some top Navy brass, concluded Midway was Yamamoto's invasion target, making possible a victory regarded by many as the turning point in the Pacific War. The account also tells the story of Rochefort's ouster from Pearl, the result of the machinations of key officers in Washington, first to deny him the Distinguished Service Medal recommended by Admiral Nimitz, then to effect his removal as OIC of Hypo. The book reports his productive final years in the Navy when he supervises the building of a floating drydock on the West Coast, then, back in Washington, finds himself directing a planning body charged with doing spade work leading to the invasion of Japan. The Epilogue narrates the postwar effort waged by Rochefort's Hypo colleagues to obtain for him the DSM denied in 1942--a drive that pays off in 1986 when President Reagan awards him the medal posthumously at a White House ceremony attended by his daughter and son. It also explores Rochefort's legacy, primarily his pioneering role at Pearl in which, contrary to Washington's wishes, he reported directly to Commander in Chief, US Fleet, providing actionable intelligence without any delays and enabling codebreaking to play the key role it did in the Battle of Midway. Ultimately, this book is aimed at bringing Joe Rochefort to life as the irreverent, fiercely independent and consequential officer that he was. It assumes his career can't be understood without looking at his entire life. It seeks to capture the interplay of policy and personality, and the role played by politics and personal rifts at the highest levels of Navy power during a time of national crisis. This bio emerges as a history of the Navy's intelligence culture.",,,09/01/11,October 15th 2011,['Joseph Rochefort'],Hardcover,"['History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military History', 'Naval History', 'Military Fiction', 'American History', 'Japan']",,9781612510606,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347375280l/11871802.jpg,4.24,['Theodore And Franklin D.

Celebrated as a novelist in the tradition of Jonathan Franzen and Philip Roth, Elliot Perlman writes of impulse and paralysis, empty marriages, lovers, gambling, and the stock market; of adult children and their parents; of poetry and prostitution, psychiatry and the law. Comic, poetic, and full of satiric insight, Seven Types of Ambiguity is, above all, a deeply romantic novel that speaks with unforgettable force about the redemptive power of love.The story is told in seven parts, by six different narrators, whose lives are entangled in unexpected ways. Following years of unrequited love, an out-of-work schoolteacher decides to take matters into his own hands, triggering a chain of events that neither he nor his psychiatrist could have anticipated. Brimming with emotional, intellectual, and moral dilemmas, this novel-reminiscent of the richest fiction of the nineteenth century in its labyrinthine complexity-unfolds at a rapid-fire pace to reveal the full extent to which these people have been affected by one another and by the insecure and uncertain times in which they live.

From the civil rights struggle in the United States to the Nazi crimes against humanity in Europe, there are more stories than people passing one another every day on the bustling streets of every crowded city.

Emerging from the depths of his own personal history, Adam sees, in a promising research topic suggested by an American World War II veteran, the beginnings of something that might just save him professionally, and perhaps even personally.As these men try to survive in early-twenty-first-century New York, history comes to life in ways neither of them could have foreseen.

Elliott J. Gorn,Dillinger's Wild Ride: The Year That Made America's Public Enemy Number One,,,,"In an era that witnessed the rise of celebrity outlaws like Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger was the most famous and flamboyant of them all. Reports on the man and his misdeeds--spiced with accounts of his swashbuckling bravado and cool daring--provided an America worn down by the Great Depression with a salacious mix of sex and violence that proved irresistible.  In Dillinger's Wild Ride, Elliott J. Gorn provides a riveting account of the year between 1933 and 1934, when the Dillinger gang pulled over a dozen bank jobs, and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars. A dozen men--police, FBI agents, gangsters, and civilians--lost their lives in the rampage, and American newspapers breathlessly followed every shooting and jail-break. As Dillinger's wild year unfolded, the tale grew larger and larger in newspapers and newsreels, and even today, Dillinger is the subject of pulp literature, serious poetry and fiction, and films, including a new movie starring Johnny Depp. What is the power of his story? Why has it lingered so long? Who was John Dillinger? Gorn illuminates the significance of Dillinger's tremendous fame and the endurance of his legacy, arguing that he represented an American fascination with primitive freedom against social convention. Dillinger's story has much to tell us about our enduring fascination with outlaws, crime and violence, about the complexity of our transition from rural to urban life, and about the transformation of America during the Great Depression.  Dillinger's Wild Ride is a compulsively readable story with an unforgettable protagonist.",,,2009,June 4th 2009,[],ebook,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'History', 'American History', 'Crime', 'Grad School']",,9780199719488,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1277074761l/7553076.jpg,3.7,[],47.0,1.0,,7553076-dillinger-s-wild-ride,,,,,91.0,221.0,289,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['51', '74', '77', '17', '2']",,,[],,

"Elliott Sober, David Sloan Wilson",Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior,,English,,"No matter what we do, however kind or generous our deeds may seem, a hidden motive of selfishness lurks--or so science has claimed for years. This book, whose publication promises to be a major scientific event, tells us differently. In Unto Others philosopher Elliott Sober and biologist David Sloan Wilson demonstrate once and for all that unselfish behavior is in fact an important feature of both biological and human nature. Their book provides a panoramic view of altruism throughout the animal kingdom--from self-sacrificing parasites to insects that subsume themselves in the superorganism of a colony to the human capacity for selflessness--even as it explains the evolutionary sense of such behavior.Explaining how altruistic behavior can evolve by natural selection, this book finally gives credence to the idea of group selection that was originally proposed by Darwin but denounced as heretical in the 1960s. With their account of this controversy, Sober and Wilson offer a detailed case study of scientific change as well as an indisputable argument for group selection as a legitimate theory in evolutionary biology.Unto Others also takes a novel evolutionary approach in explaining the ultimate psychological motives behind unselfish human behavior. Developing a theory of the proximate mechanisms that most likely evolved to motivate adaptive helping behavior, Sober and Wilson show how people and perhaps other species evolved the capacity to care for others as a goal in itself.A truly interdisciplinary work that blends biology, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology, this book will permanently change not just our view of selfless behavior but also our understanding of many issues in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.",,,1998,October 1st 1999,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Evolution', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Nonfiction', 'Biology', 'Sociology']",,9780674930476,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347351180l/134244.jpg,3.82,[],25.0,1.0,,134244.Unto_Others,,,,,91.0,91.0,416,,Harvard University Press,"['23', '37', '23', '8', '0']",,,[],,
Ellis Avery,The Teahouse Fire,,English,,"""Like attending seasons of elegant tea parties—each one resplendent with character and drama. Delicious.”—Maxine Hong Kingston The story of two women whose lives intersect in late-nineteenth-century Japan, The Teahouse Fire is also a portrait of one of the most fascinating places and times in all of history—Japan as it opens its doors to the West. It was a period when wearing a different color kimono could make a political statement, when women stopped blackening their teeth to profess an allegiance to Western ideas, and when Japan’s most mysterious rite—the tea ceremony—became not just a sacramental meal, but a ritual battlefield. We see it all through the eyes of Aurelia, an American orphan adopted by the Shin family, proprietors of a tea ceremony school, after their daughter, Yukako, finds her hiding on their grounds. Aurelia becomes Yukako’s closest companion, and they, the Shin family, and all of Japan face a time of great challenges and uncertainty. Told in an enchanting and unforgettable voice, The Teahouse Fire is a lively, provocative, and lushly detailed historical novel of epic scope and compulsive readability.",,,01/01/00,December 28th 2006,"['Urako', 'Shin Family']",Hardcover,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Historical', 'LGBT', 'Asia', 'Queer', 'Asian Literature', 'Romance', 'Audiobook']",,9781594489303,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439030547l/47633._SY475_.jpg,3.5,"['Stonewall Book Award for Literature (2008)', 'Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Debut Fiction (2006)']",94.0,1.0,,47633.The_Teahouse_Fire,,,,,83.0,3314.0,391,,Riverhead Hardcover,"['621', '1115', '1002', '438', '138']",,,['Kyoto (Japan)'],,

Elmer Belmont Potter,Bull Halsey,,,Biography & Autobiography,"Applauded by the public and revered by the men who served under him, Adm. William F. Halsey was one of the leading American personalities of World War II. His reputation as a no-holds-barred fighter and his tough-guy expression earned him the nickname ""Bull,"" yet he was also known for showing genuine compassion toward his men and inspiring them to great feats in the Pacific. Originally disclaiming the praise heaped on him, Halsey eventually came to believe in the swashbuckling legend that surrounded him, and his conduct became increasingly controversial. Naval historian E. B. Potter, who established his reputation with an award-winning biography of Chester W. Nimitz, gets behind the stereotype of this national hero and describes Halsey at his best and worst, including his controversial actions at Leyte Gulf.

Elmore Leonard,The Hot Kid,,English,,"The Barnes & Noble Review When the The New York Times calls someone ""the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever,"" that's no small compliment. This talented author has shown an extraordinary range in his work, from westerns to crime stories (both contemporary and historical) to a novel about baseball and more.In The Hot Kid, Elmore ""Dutch"" Leonard breaks new ground with a fast-paced, multifaceted tale of Prohibition-era crime, told from multiple perspectives that reflect the unexpected shifts of allegiance in this turbulent time. Set against a backdrop of speakeasys and shootouts, fast cars and even faster women, this stirring tale recounts a time when life was cheap on both sides of the law. The story unfolds in Oklahoma, featuring the exploits of four ""hot kids"" -- young lawman Carl Webster, bad-seed oilman's son Jack Belmont, glamorous gun moll Louly Brown, and true-crime journalist Tony Antonelli. Carl Webster, since his first personal encounter with crime as a teenage witness to a brutal robbery by notorious crook Emmet Long, has sought justice. His keen mind and sharpshooter's eye quickly build him a hot reputation in the U.S. Marshals Service, especially after he declares, ""If I have to pull my weapon, I'll shoot to kill"" and proves he has what it takes to back up his claim...Jack Belmont has big dreams. His goal is to join the ranks of America's most feared criminals to replace John Dillinger as Public Enemy No. 1. This young outlaw has all the instincts of a cold-blooded killer, plus a powerful thirst for glory. He's got a long way to go to join the ranks of Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, and Machine-Gun Kelly but he's off to a good enough start that Webster is hot on his trail...Louly Brown started with nothing but she wasn't about to settle for that. Her first claim to fame came when her cousin married Charley ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. Later, running off with ex-con Joe Young added spice to her life. But she was smart enough to see that helping Carl Webster put a stop to Joe's crime spree would be a better deal than sharing his fate. After the smoke cleared, Louly really came into her own, selling her story to the papers, then setting her sights on the handsome lawman who'd captured her heart.Tony Antonelli loves the danger and fame that come along with rubbing shoulders with heartless gangsters, dedicated lawmen, gorgeous gun molls, and bloodthirsty vigilantes in the course of his work for True Detective Mystery magazine. Whether he's writing about bank robbers or the Black Hand, the KKK or rum running, or hot young lawmen and cold-blooded killers and their sexy sidekicks, Tony views other people's troubles as more than just bread-and-butter; they provide an adrenaline-charged kick to his own life, as well as vicarious thrills for eager readers.Elmore Leonard hits his target with The Hot Kid, an unforgettable tale of high adventure where the crooks are out to prove that crime really can pay and where federal marshals trade high risks for low salary to bring these wanted felons in ""dead or alive.""",Carl Webster #1,,10/28/05,August 29th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Fiction', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Audiobook', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Novels']",,9780060724238,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316544098l/85207.jpg,3.76,[],361.0,4.0,,85207.The_Hot_Kid,,,,,93.0,4460.0,387,,HarperTorch,"['978', '1832', '1318', '271', '61']",,,[],,

Elmore Leonard,The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard,,English,,"No one is more evocative of the dusty, gutsy hey-day of the American West than Elmore Leonard. And no story about a young writer struggling to launch his career ever matched its subject matter better than the tale behind Leonard's Western oeuvre.In 1950, fresh out of college -- having written two ""pointless"" stories, as he describes them -- Leonard decided he needed to pick a market, a big one, which would give him a better chance to be published while he learned to write. In choosing between crime and Westerns, the latter had an irresistible pull -- Leonard loved movies set in the West. As he researched deeper into settings, Arizona in the 1880s captured his imagination: the Spanish influence, the standoffs and shootouts between Apache Indians and the U.S. cavalry ...His first dozen stories sold for 2 cents a word, for $100 each. The rest is history.This first-ever complete collection of Leonard's thirty Western tales will thrill lovers of the genre, his die-hard fans, and everyone in between -- and makes a terrific study of the launch of a phenomenal career.From his very first story ever published -- ""The Trail of the Apache"" -- through five decades of classic Western tales, The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard demonstrates again and again the superb talent for language and gripping narrative that has made Leonard one of the most acclaimed and influential writers of our time.",,,11/06/75,November 2nd 2004,"['Eric Travisin', 'William De Both', 'Barney Fry', 'Kleecan', 'Pondichay', 'Art McLeverty', 'Angsman', 'Ygenio Baca', 'Ed Hyde', 'Billy Guay']",Hardcover,"['Westerns', 'Short Stories', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure', 'Literature', 'The United States Of America', 'Americana', 'Historical']",,9780060724252,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407106187l/85222.jpg,4.09,[],86.0,1.0,,85222.The_Complete_Western_Stories_of_Elmore_Leonard,,,,,96.0,2371.0,544,,William Morrow,"['867', '971', '431', '79', '23']",,,[],,

There she witnessed the full impact of the war and first formed the ambition to write an account of what history - the great political events driven by men of power, wealth, and ambition - does when it reaches the realm of ordinary people struggling for life and bread. The central character in this powerful and unforgiving novel is Ida Mancuso, a schoolteacher whose husband has died and whose feckless teenage son treats the war as his playground. A German soldier on his way to North Africa rapes her, falls in love with her, and leaves her pregnant with a boy whose survival becomes Ida's passion.  Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood.

Elsa Watson (Goodreads Author),Maid Marian,,English,,"An irresistible reimagining of the Robin Hood legend, Maid Marian brings to life the rollicking—and romantic—world of the Middle Ages.An orphan and heiress to a large country estate, Marian Fitzwater is wed at the age of five to an equally young nobleman, Lord Hugh of Sencaster, a union that joins her inheritance to his. But when she is seventeen, Lord Hugh, whom she hasn’t seen in years, dies under mysterious circumstances. Marian is left alone again—a widow who has never been a bride. But now, like all unmarried young ladies of fortune, she is made the ward of King Richard the Lionheart. Since Richard is away on Crusade, Marian’s fate lies in the hands of his mother, the formidable Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. The bridegroom Eleanor selects will get Marian’s lands and, in return, pledge his loyalty—and silver—to the king. Marian herself is irrelevant and she knows it. Determined not to be sold into another sham marriage, she seeks out the one man who can help uncover the queen’s intentions: Robin Hood, the notorious Saxon outlaw of Sherwood Forest.Marian is surprised to discover that the famed “prince of thieves” is not only helpful but handsome, likeable, and sympathetic to her plight. Robin’s men intercept a letter from Queen Eleanor, from which Marian learns, to her horror, that she is to marry her late husband’s brother.

Elvis Newman,The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis,,English,,"No doubt, history is littered with theories and beliefs that not only proved to be wrong in the end, but also costly as far as the human search for truth and development is concerned. The view that the Earth was the physical and the biological center of the Universe was one such failed theory, one that cost many famous scientists most of their lives, and held back societies everywhere for decades or hundreds of years behind what is now considered a given truth. In the current work under consideration, religion and evolution theories come under scrutiny in light of recent scientific facts that dispute their most important claims about the origins of the species. In The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis, Elvis Newman presents both astounding facts and findings about the human genome, as well as paradigm-shifting theories emanating from Zecharia Sitchin's work around the Sumerian clay tablets. About the Author A futurist researcher with an MBA, Elvis Newman has worked as a ghost writer and researcher for well-known new age and futurist gurus of our times.

But it was not until she reached Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar that her first full-blown episode, complete with voices in her head and terrifying suicidal fantasies, forced her into a psychiatric hospital.Saks would later attend Yale Law School where one night, during her first term, she had a breakdown that left her singing on the roof of the law school library at midnight. She was taken to the emergency room, force-fed antipsychotic medication, and tied hand-and-foot to the cold metal of a hospital bed. She spent the next five months in a psychiatric ward.So began Saks's long war with her own internal demons and the equally powerful forces of stigma. Today she is a chaired professor of law who researches and writes about the rights of the mentally ill. She is married to a wonderful man.In The Center Cannot Hold, Elyn Saks discusses frankly and movingly the paranoia, the inability to tell imaginary fears from real ones, and the voices in her head insisting she do terrible things, as well as the many obstacles she overcame to become the woman she is today.

Elyse Draper (Goodreads Author),Freewill,,English,,"Freewill is a Young Adult slipstream novel that embodies both science fiction and dark fantasy, with strong paranormal romantic overtones. Within its pages a world comes to life, where mythology is real and evident in humanity's interaction with the ethereal Others. Ellie, once a human but now an Other (an empathic creature surviving in a fugue state, inside the otherworldly veil for over sixty years,) has been finding the strength to exist through her compulsion to be a muse; that is, until she meets Christopher. Christopher, a present day young man with the special talent to foresee the truth of the intangible Others, quickly becomes Ellie's heart's desire. Ellie and Christopher inevitably find themselves developing an unusual relationship, where touching one another can only happen in Christopher’s dreams. Unbeknownst to them, ever since Ellie's birth in 1922, destiny's hand, guided by mythical forces and fairytale lineage, has been pushing them into each other's embrace, while also potentially into the arms of evil Others called the Timoro, and into the sights of dangerous feuding organizations-- the Symboulio: the council of the ancient and divine, and the Symbio: the new world council of acceptance.In this first book of the trilogy, the readers start to understand that Ellie’s transformation into an Other as an empath is exceptionally rare; only happening one additional time, over 2,000 years ago. Finally awakened by Christopher’s presence, if she does not build a connection to lessen the burden of feeling the world’s emotions she will cease to exist. Delving into a mixture of historical events, mythical manifestations, and folklore, the setting provides glimpses into familiar images that lull the reader into believing they know what may happen next … but that doesn't account for Free Will.",Freewill #1,First of Three,,March 11th 2012,"['Ellie Tickle', 'Christopher Ross']",ebook,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Paranormal', 'Romance', 'Paranormal Romance']",,9781476448398,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332437057l/13556699.jpg,3.92,[],169.0,2.0,,13556699-freewill,,,,,94.0,49.0,250,,Elyse Draper,"['15', '20', '11', '1', '2']",,,[],,

Brunner claims that the task of that generation was to find a way back to a legitimate natural theology.

The penultimate novel of the Rougon-Macquart cycle, La Debacle (1892) takes as its subject the dramatic events of the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune of 1870-71. During Zola's lifetime it was the bestselling of all his novels, praised by contemporaries for its epic sweep as well as its attention to historical detail. The novel seeks to explain why the Second Empire ended in a crushing military defeat and revolutionary violence. It focuses on ordinary soldiers, showing their bravery and suffering in the midst of circumstances they cannot control. Zola's descriptions are some of the most powerful he ever wrote. He skilfully integrates his narrative of events and the fictional lives of his characters to provide the finest account of this tragic chapter in the history of France.

Upon being discovered, Emilie is revived and immediately incarcerated in a maximum-security psych ward, despite her protestations that she is not crazy, and can provide valid reasons for her actions if someone would only listen.Treated as a criminal, heavily medicated, and stripped of all freedoms, Emilie is denied communication with the outside world, and falls prey to the unwelcome attentions of Dr. Sharp, head of the hospital's psychiatry department. As Dr. Sharp grows more predatory by the day, Emilie begins a secret diary to document her terrifying experience, and to maintain her sanity in this environment that could surely drive anyone mad. But when Emilie opens her notebook to find a desperate letter from a young woman imprisoned within an insane asylum in Victorian England, and bearing her own name and description, a portal to another world is blasted wide open.As these letters from the past continue to appear, Emilie escapes further into this mysterious alternate reality where sisterhoods are formed, romance between female inmates blossoms, striped wallpaper writhes with ghosts, and highly intellectual rats speak the Queen's English.But is it real? Or is Emilie truly as mad as she is constantly told she is?The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls blurs harsh reality and magical historical fantasy whilst issuing a scathing critique of society's treatment of women and the mental health care industry's treatment of its patients, showing in the process that little has changed throughout the ages.Welcome to the Asylum.

"Emilio D'Alessandro, Filippo Ulivieri (Goodreads Author) (With), Simon Marsh (Translation)",Stanley Kubrick and Me: Thirty Years at His Side,,English,,"This intimate portrait by his former personal assistant and confidante reveals the man behind the legendary filmmaker—for the first time.Stanley Kubrick, the director of a string of timeless movies from Lolita and Dr. Strangelove to A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, and others, has always been depicted by the media as the Howard Hughes of filmmakers, a weird artist obsessed with his work and privacy to the point of madness. But who was he really? Emilio D'Alessandro lets us see. A former Formula Ford driver who was a minicab chauffeur in London during the Swinging Sixties, he took a job driving a giant phallus through the city that became his introduction to the director. Honest, reliable, and ready to take on any task, Emilio found his way into Kubrick's neurotic, obsessive heart. He became his personal assistant, his right-hand man and confidant, working for him from A Clockwork Orange until Kubrick's death in 1999.Emilio was the silent guy in the room when the script for The Shining was discussed. He still has the coat Jack Nicholson used in the movie. He was an extra on the set of Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's last movie. He knew all the actors and producers Kubrick worked with; he observed firsthand Kubrick's working methods down to the smallest detail. Making no claim of expertise in cinematography but with plenty of anecdotes, he offers a completely fresh perspective on the artist and a warm, affecting portrait of a generous, kind, caring man who was a perfectionist in work and life.",,,10/30/12,May 17th 2016,[],Hardcover,"['Film', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Memoir']",,9781628726695,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455989527l/25898599._SY475_.jpg,4.1,[],97.0,1.0,,25898599-stanley-kubrick-and-me,,,,,94.0,372.0,384,,Arcade,"['148', '142', '60', '17', '5']",,,[],,

Emily Colas,Just Checking: Scenes From the Life of an Obsessive-Compulsive,,English,,"We all worry. We all have moments of unfounded dread (Is someone behind that door?), or little phobias (roaches) or superstitions (step on a crack) that we indulge. Just Checking is an autobiographical account of what it is like to live with a full-blown case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which, at its height, finds author Emily Colas nervous that she will contract a disease from blood that she sees on television. In the course of the book, what at first appear to her husband and friends to be Colas's idiosyncratic notions accumulate until she is frozen by the astounding psychological binds of OCD. Using precise (of course), connect-the-dots scenes, Colas draws a life that is at first highly monitored and ultimately unraveled by her disorder. One imagines that from afar, Colas's behavior at the height of her illness would look incomprehensible and just plain weird: She has to check the dishwasher multiple times before using it to make sure the cat is safe; the packaging of every new toothbrush has to meet rigorous sanitary standards; the landlord can't attempt to find new tenants for her apartment  she won't let them in the house. But readers are not at a distance here. Instead, we become privy to Colas's somewhat apologetic but firm explanations of what her logic was, and what it felt like to be afraid. She is so honest and witty that one can't help liking her, rooting for her, and wishing help would come. In a typical vignette, when the family tries to go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (""definitely a mistake""), Colas is terrified that shewillstep on blood: When I was a kid in New York, all we had to eat on the street were pretzels and hot dogs. Food that was readily identifiable. Now, vendors sell the fanciest things with cherries, berries, jelly, and other crap that's way too close to the color of blood. We finally made it to where we had to go, but not before I had inspected the bottom of my shoes. There was a mushy red object there. Maybe a cherry, possibly a finger. The kids watched the parade on TV and I had a nice new worry. My kids don't even remember that lovely November day, but, lucky for me, I do. This event is sad and resonant, but it also manages to be viscerally entertaining. The result is that instead of inspiring schadenfreude, this book reminds us that psychological disorders are often exaggerations of the ordinary and familiar. We all, on a continuum, wish to survive, to avoid disease, to impose order on our lives. We sympathize with Colas's desperate attempts to find safety and with her seemingly loving husband's gradual loss of tolerance. Even the not-so-funny poems that are occasionally interspersed among the perfectly crafted chapterettes find their place. Strange as it may be to find charm in a memoir of illness, Colas is utterly winning.

Emily Esfahani Smith,The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters,,,,"This wise, stirring book argues that the search for meaning can immeasurably deepen our lives and is far more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.There is a myth in our culture that the search for meaning is some esoteric pursuit that you have to travel to a distant monastery or page through dusty volumes to figure out life s great secret. The truth is, there are untapped sources of meaning all around us right here, right now. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology; on insights from George Eliot, Viktor Frankl, Aristotle, the Buddha, and other great minds; and on interviews with seekers of meaning, Emily Esfahani Smith lays out the four pillars upon which meaning rests. Belonging We all need to find our tribe and forge relationships in which we feel understood, recognized, and valued to know we matter to others.Purpose We all need a far-reaching goal that motivates us, serves as the organizing principle of our lives, and drives us to make a contribution to the world.Storytelling We are all storytellers, taking our disparate experiences and assembling them into a coherent narrative that allows us to make sense of ourselves and the world. Transcendence During a transcendent or mystical experience, we feel we have risen above the everyday world and are connected to something vast and meaningful. To bring those concepts to life, Smith visits a tight-knit fishing village on the Chesapeake Bay, stargazes in West Texas, attends a dinner where young people gather to share their experiences of untimely loss, and more. And she explores how we might begin to build a culture of meaning in our schools, our workplaces, and our communities. Inspiring and story-driven, The Power of Meaning will strike a profound chord in anyone seeking a richer, more satisfying life.""",,,,January 10th 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Philosophy', 'Personal Development', 'Spirituality', 'Audiobook', 'Inspirational', 'Leadership', 'Adult']",,9780553419993,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465653308l/30008950.jpg,4.02,[],97.0,1.0,,30008950-the-power-of-meaning,,,,,95.0,2882.0,304,,Crown Publishing Group (NY),"['945', '1223', '575', '117', '22']",,,[],,

Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.",,,11/06/10,May 11th 2010,"['Tessa Russo', 'Nick McKenna', 'Rachel White', 'Dex Thaler']",Hardcover,"['Chick Lit', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Womens Fiction', 'Relationships', 'Contemporary Romance']",,9780312554163,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441249140l/7114761._SX318_.jpg,3.73,[],82.0,1.0,,7114761-heart-of-the-matter,,,,,89.0,104141.0,368,,St. Martin's Press,"['27163', '36372', '29187', '8306', '3113']",,,[],,

With a fulfilling career and satisfying relationship, she has convinced everyone, including herself, that her life is just as she wants it to be.

Emily Liebert (Goodreads Author),You Knew Me When,,English,,"Best friends forever… until life got in the way. Katherine Hill left her small New England hometown in pursuit of a dream. Now, twelve years later, she’s a high-powered cosmetics executive in Manhattan and a much glossier version of her former self, unrecognizable to her family and old friends. Not that she would know—she hasn’t been home in over a decade. Laney Marten always swore she’d never get ""stuck” in Manchester, Vermont. No, she was destined to live out her glamorous big-city dreams. Instead, she wound up a young wife and mother. That was when her best friend ran out. When Katherine receives word of an inheritance from former neighbor Luella Hancock, she reluctantly returns home to the people and places she left behind. Hoping for a second chance, she’s met by an unforgiving Laney, her former best friend. And there’s someone else who’s moved on without her—someone she once loved. Tethered to their shared inheritance of Luella’s sprawling Victorian mansion, Katherine and Laney are forced to address their long-standing grudges. Through this, they come to understand that while life has taken them in different directions, ultimately the bonds of friendship and sisterhood still bind them together.

Emily Nagoski (Goodreads Author),Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life,,English,,"An essential exploration of why and how women’s sexuality works—based on groundbreaking research and brain science—that will radically transform your sex life into one filled with confidence and joy.Researchers have spent the last decade trying to develop a “pink pill” for women to function like Viagra does for men. So where is it? Well, for reasons this book makes crystal clear, that pill will never exist—but as a result of the research that’s gone into it, scientists in the last few years have learned more about how women’s sexuality works than we ever thought possible, and Come as You Are explains it all.The first lesson in this essential, transformative book by Dr. Emily Nagoski is that every woman has her own unique sexuality, like a fingerprint, and that women vary more than men in our anatomy, our sexual response mechanisms, and the way our bodies respond to the sexual world. So we never need to judge ourselves based on others’ experiences. Because women vary, and that’s normal.Second lesson: sex happens in a context. And all the complications of everyday life influence the context surrounding a woman’s arousal, desire, and orgasm. Cutting-edge research across multiple disciplines tells us that the most important factor for women in creating and sustaining a fulfilling sex life, is not what you do in bed or how you do it, but how you feel about it. Which means that stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman’s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it. Once you understand these factors, and how to influence them, you can create for yourself better sex and more profound pleasure than you ever thought possible.And Emily Nagoski can prove it.",,,,March 3rd 2015,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Feminism', 'Psychology', 'Sexuality', 'Self Help', 'Health', 'Relationships', 'Audiobook', 'Womens']",,9781476762098,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421037685l/22609341.jpg,4.29,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science & Technology (2015)'],89.0,1.0,,22609341-come-as-you-are,,,,,96.0,15947.0,400,,Simon Schuster,"['8012', '5245', '2067', '483', '140']",,,[],,

Emma Bull (Goodreads Author),Territory,,English,,"Wyatt Earp. Doc Holliday. Ike Clanton. You think you know the story. You don't. Tombstone, Arizona in 1881 is the site of one of the richest mineral strikes in American history, where veins of silver run like ley lines under the earth, a network of power that belongs to anyone who knows how to claim and defend it.Above the ground, power is also about allegiances. A magician can drain his friends' strength to strengthen himself, and can place them between him and danger. The one with the most friends stands to win the territory.Jesse Fox left his Eastern college education to travel West, where he's made some decidedly odd friends, like the physician Chow Lung, who insists that Jesse has a talent for magic. In Tombstone, Jesse meets the tubercular Doc Holliday, whose inner magic is as suppressed as his own, but whose power is enough to attract the sorcerous attention of Wyatt Earp. Mildred Benjamin is a young widow making her living as a newspaper typesetter, and--unbeknownst to the other ladies of Tombstone--selling tales of Western derring-do to the magazines back East. Like Jesse, Mildred has episodes of seeing things that can't possibly be there. When a failed stage holdup results in two dead, Tombstone explodes with speculation about who attempted the robbery. The truth could destroy Earp's plans for wealth and glory, and he'll do anything to bury it. Meanwhile, outlaw leader John Ringo wants the same turf as Earp. Each courts Jesse as an ally, and tries to isolate him by endangering his friends, as they struggle for magical dominance of the territory.Events are building toward the shootout of which you may have heard.

Including women married and single, young and old, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual, the anthology covers historical development and changing mores through the seventeenth century, after the Restoration of Charles II, a time of relative freedom for women; the eighteenth century, when the cult of romantic friendship reached its peak; the nineteenth century, when women writers wrote about issues of same-sex desire indirectly and explored complex issues such as death in tones of weariness and resignation; and the twentieth century, when poets began to engage in more overt explorations of women's bodies, sensuality, and lovemaking. Emma Donoghue's introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women's poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures. Poems Between Women is testimony not only to the recurring theme of the unique bonds among women but also to the universality of love, friendship, and creativity.",,,,1999.0,,,,0231109253,9780231109253,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d_1dqrZtllwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,3.86,,,,,,,,,,,,256.0,,,,66.0,,,,

Emma Forrest,Your Voice in My Head,,English,,"A dazzling and devastating memoir — Girl Interrupted for the Juno generation.Talented, prolific and charming, Emma Forrest was settled in Manhattan at twenty-two and on contract to the Guardian when she realized that her quirks had gone beyond eccentricity, past the warm waters of weird and into those cold, deep patches of the sea where people lose their lives.Lonely, in a dangerous cycle of cutting and bulimia, and drawn inexplicably to damaging and cruel relationships, she found herself in the chair of a slim, balding and effortlessly optimistic psychiatrist — a man whose wisdom and humanity would wrench her from the vibrant and dangerous tide of herself, and who would help her to recover when she tried to end her life.Emma's loving and supportive family and friends circled around her in panic. Like Ophelia, Emma was on the brink of drowning. But she was also still working, still exploring, still writing. And then she fell in love.One day, when Emma called to make an appointment with her psychiatrist, she found no one there. He had died, shockingly, at the age of fifty-three, leaving behind a young family for whom he had fought to survive. Processing the premature doorstep, a failed suicide, she was adrift. And when her significant and all-consuming relationship also fell apart, she was forced to cling to the page for survival.Your Voice in My Head is spiked with wit, humour and unique perception. It not only explores the crashing weight of depression, mania and suffering, but also the beauty of love and the heartbreak of loss. It is also, fundamentally, about our relationship with ourselves.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/17/11,January 10th 2012,['Emma Forrest'],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Book Club', 'Contemporary']",,9780307359322,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333576438l/12046085.jpg,3.76,[],92.0,1.0,,12046085-your-voice-in-my-head,,,,,88.0,4107.0,224,,Vintage Canada,"['1116', '1448', '1069', '369', '105']",,,"['New York State (United States)', 'Los Angeles, California (United States)']",,
Emma Goldman,Anarchism and Other Essays,,English,,"In the eighteen-nineties and for years thereafter, America reverberated with the name of the ""notorious Anarchist,"" feminist, revolutionist and agitator, Emma Goldman. A Russian Jewish immigrant at the age of 17, she moved by her own efforts from seamstress in a clothing factory to internationally known radical lecturer, writer, editor and friend of the oppressed. This book is a collection of her remarkably penetrating essays, far in advance of their time, originally published by the Mother Earth press which she founded.In the first of these essays, Anarchism: What It Really Stands For, she says, ""Direct action, having proven effective along economic lines, is equally potent in the environment of the individual."" In Minorities Versus Majorities she holds that social and economic well-being will result only through ""the non-compromising determination of intelligent minorities, and not through the mass."" Other pieces deal with The Hypocrisy of Puritanism; Prisons: A Social Crim and Failure; The Psychology of Political Violence—note the relevence of these themes to our own time; The Drama: A Powerful Disseminator of Radical Thought; Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty; and The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation. A biographical sketch by Hippolyte Havel precedes the essays.Anarchism and Other Essays provides a fascinating look into revolutionary issues at the turn of the century, a prophetic view of the social and economic future, much of which we have seen take place, and above all, a glimpse into the mind of an extraordinary woman: brilliant, provocative, dedicated, passionate, and what used to be called ""high-minded.""Unabridged republication of the 3rd (1917) edition, with a new Introduction by Richard Drinnon.

Emma Hart (Goodreads Author),The Upside to Being Single,,English,,"
  If anyone asks, I knew better than to flash my boobs for Mardi Gras beads.
  I still don’t know why I did it. Maybe it was the dare from my two best friends. Maybe it was the guys on the balcony saying they’d throw Fireball shots with the beads. Or maybe it was the quiet guy in the corner of that same balcony with piercing gray eyes, wavy dark hair, and a smile so tempting I wanted to climb up there and lick it off his face. Maybe it was because I never thought I’d see them again. Not that it matters. Not today. Because the hotel I manage was finally bought—and the guy who walks in and introduces himself as my new boss is Mr. Tall, Dark, and Silent.  There are many upsides to being single.

Emma Restall Orr,"The Wakeful World: Animism, Mind and the Self in Nature",,,,"Over the past few hundred years, animism has been dismissed as a primitive, naive and irrational perspective, irrelevant within the civilised West. In The Wakeful World, Emma Restall Orr argues that this is based on the misrepresentation, drawn in crayon, that each tree and stone has its own Christian-like immortal soul. Taking the reader on a philosophical adventure, Restall Orr explores the heritage of Western thought with precision, enthusiasm and sensitivity, considering how soul, spirit, mind and consciousness have been understood through millennia. Challenging the prevailing worldviews of materialism and dualism, she presents animism as a radically different, yet mature and coherent philosophy. Providing deep green ethics with a wholly rational metaphysical foundation, The Wakeful World is a compelling view of the nature of existence and the experience of reality, giving solid ground for the now necessary journey to a sustainable world. This original and lively book brings back animism - a most useful range of ideas which reductivists have somewhat wildly abandoned during the last century - into focus once more just when it is badly needed to cure current confusions about mind and body - Dr Mary Midgley, Moral Philosopher""",,,,October 26th 2012,[],ebook,"['Spirituality', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Nature', 'Philosophy', 'Paganism', 'Occult']",,9781780994086,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365961789l/17048117.jpg,4.27,[],43.0,1.0,,17048117-the-wakeful-world,,,,,95.0,66.0,313,,John Hunt Publishing,"['32', '23', '8', '3', '0']",,,[],,

Emma Scott (Goodreads Author),Full Tilt,,English,,"I would love you forever, if I only had the chance...Kacey Dawson has always lived life on the edge--impulsively, sometimes recklessly. And now, as lead guitarist for a hot up-and-coming band, she is poised at the brink of fame and fortune. But she is torn between wanting to be a serious musician, and the demons that lure her down the glittering, but alcohol-soaked path of rock stardom. A wrecked concert in Las Vegas threatens to ruin her career entirely. She wakes up with the hangover from hell and no memory of the night before, or how she ended up on her limo driver’s couch... Jonah Fletcher is running out of time. He knows his situation is hopeless, and he's vowed to make the most of the handful of months he has left to him. His plans include seeing the opening of his glass installation at a prestigious art gallery…they do not include falling in love with a wild, tempestuous rock musician who wound up passed out on his couch. Jonah sees that Kacey is on a path to self-destruction. He lets her crash with him for a few days to dry out and get her head on straight. But neither of them expected the deep connection they felt, or how that connection could grow so fast from friendship into something more. Something deep and pure and life-changing…something as fragile as glass, that they both know will shatter in the end no matter how hard they try to hold on to it.

Emma Scott (Goodreads Author),The Butterfly Project,,English,,"""Where you are is home...""At age fourteen, Zelda Rossi witnessed the unthinkable, and has spent the last ten years hardening her heart against the guilt and grief. She channels her pain into her art: a dystopian graphic novel where vigilantes travel back in time to stop heinous crimes—like child abduction—before they happen. Zelda pitches her graphic novel to several big-time comic book publishers in New York City, only to have her hopes crash and burn. Circumstances leave her stranded in an unfamiliar city, and in an embarrassing moment of weakness, she meets a guarded young man with a past he’d do anything to change...Beckett Copeland spent two years in prison for armed robbery, and is now struggling to keep his head above water. A bike messenger by day, he speeds around New York City, riding fast and hard but going nowhere, his criminal record holding him back almost as much as the guilt of his crime. Zelda and Beckett form a grudging alliance of survival, and in between their stubborn clash of wills, they slowly begin to provide each other with the warmth of forgiveness, healing, and maybe even love. But when Zelda and Beckett come face to face with their pasts, they must choose to hold on to the guilt and regret that bind them, or let go and open their hearts for a shot at happiness. The Butterfly Project is a novel that reveals the power of forgiveness, and how even the smallest decisions of the heart can—like the flutter of a butterfly’s wings—create currents that strengthen into gale winds, altering the course of a life forever. #standalone",,,,February 28th 2017,[],ebook,"['Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Audiobook', 'Fiction', 'Adult', 'New Adult Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Drama']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485440750l/33519394._SY475_.jpg,4.41,[],100.0,1.0,,33519394-the-butterfly-project,,,,,98.0,5401.0,256,,,"['3007', '1750', '509', '104', '31']",,,[],,

Yet another failed relationship is just the motivation she needs to move from New York to San Francisco with the hopes of resurrecting her dance career and discovering that she is more than the sum of her rap sheet. As Darlene struggles in her new city, the last thing she wants is to become entangled with her handsome—but cranky—neighbor and his adorable little girl...

Emma Smith,No Way of Telling,,English,,"The day they were sent home early from school because of a threatening blizzard, Amy rode with the other pupils in Mrs. Rhys's van to where the road ended, but from there she had to trudge by herself through the driving snowflakes to the Gwyntfa, the gray stone cottage where she lived alone with her grandmother, Mrs. Bowen. Once home, Amy knew she was safe. With a well-stoked larder and plenty of oil for the lamps, her grandmother promised her they might even enjoy being snowed in. They liked each other's company and every night would sit one on each side of the fire, working at their patchwork quilt until it was time for a cup of tea and a game of Patience or Two-handed Whist before bed. But on the day the snow began they never played their game of cards. They were interrupted by a growl from Amy's dog, a tremendous thump at the door, and an intrusion of such violence as they had never in their lives met before. Yet though there was no way of telling who their intruder might be, Mrs. Bowen somehow knew he meant them no harm; and in the four extraordinary days that followed, bringing intruders of a different kind, Amy discovered that her grandmother's instinct had been right.Against the beautifully portrayed background of a Welsh hillfarm in winter, suspense mounts almost unbearably for Amy and her grandmother - and for the reader as well - as they face ruthless evil in this contemporary story superbly told by a distinguished writer.",,,11/05/72,June 1972,[],Paperback,"['Childrens', 'Fiction', 'Adventure']",,9780370012360,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1232309147l/6111016.jpg,4.1,['Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Nominee for Fiction (1973)'],77.0,1.0,,6111016-no-way-of-telling,,,,,95.0,61.0,256,,Random House,"['21', '28', '9', '3', '0']",,,[],,

Emmanuel Carrère,Le Royaume,,French,,"Le Royaume raconte l’histoire des débuts de la chrétienté, vers la fin du Ier siècle après Jésus Christ. Il raconte comment deux hommes, essentiellement, Paul et Luc, ont transformé une petite secte juive refermée autour de son prédicateur crucifié sous l’empereur Tibère et qu’elle affirmait être le messie, en une religion qui en trois siècles a miné l’Empire romain puis conquis le monde et concerne aujourd’hui encore le quart de l’humanité.Cette histoire, portée par Emmanuel Carrère, devient une fresque où se recrée le monde méditerranéen d’alors, agité de soubresauts politiques et religieux intenses sous le couvercle trompeur de la pax romana. C’est une évocation tumultueuse, pleine de rebondissements et de péripéties, de personnages hauts en couleur.Mais Le Royaume c’est aussi, habilement tissée dans la trame historique, une méditation sur ce que c’est que le christianisme, en quoi il nous interroge encore aujourd’hui, en quoi il nous concerne, croyants ou incroyants, comment l’invraisemblable renversement des valeurs qu’il propose (les premiers seront les derniers, etc.) a pu connaître ce succès puis cette postérité. Ce qu’il faut savoir aussi, c’est que cette réflexion est constamment menée dans le respect et une certaine forme d’amitié pour les acteurs de cette étonnante histoire, acteurs passés, acteurs présents, et que cela lui donne une dimension profondément humaine.Respect, amitié qu’Emmanuel Carrère dit aussi éprouver pour celui qu’il a été, lui, il y a quelque temps. Car, comme toujours dans chacun de ses livres, depuis L’Adversaire, l’engagement de l’auteur dans ce qu’il raconte est entier. Pendant trois ans, il y a 25 ans, Emmanuel Carrère a été un chrétien fervent, catholique pratiquant, on pourrait presque dire : avec excès. Il raconte aussi, en arrière-plan de la grande Histoire, son histoire à lui, les tourments qu’il traversait alors et comment la religion fut un temps un havre, ou une fuite. Et si, aujourd’hui, il n’est plus croyant, il garde la volonté d’interroger cette croyance, d’enquêter sur ce qu’il fut, ne s’épargnant pas, ne cachant rien de qui il est, avec cette brutale franchise, cette totale absence d’autocensure qu’on lui connaît.Il faut aussi évoquer la manière si particulière qu’a Emmanuel Carrère d’écrire cette histoire. D’abord l’abondance et la qualité de la documentation qui en font un livre où on apprend des choses, beaucoup de choses. Ensuite, cette tonalité si particulière qui, s’appuyant sur la fluidité d’une écriture certaine, passe dans un même mouvement de la familiarité à la gravité, ne se prive d’aucun ressort ni d’aucun registre, pouvant ainsi mêler la réflexion sur le point de vue de Luc au souvenir d’une vidéo porno, l’évocation de la crise mystique qu’a connu l’auteur et les problèmes de gardes de ses enfants (avec, il faut dire, une baby-sitter américaine familière de Philip K.

What he accomplishes is nothing short of a literary miracle: a heartrending narrative of endless love, a meditation on courage and decency in the face of adversity, an intimate and reverent look at the extraordinary beauty and nobility of ordinary lives.Precise, sober, and suspenseful, as full of twists and turns as any novel, Lives Other Than My Own confronts terrifying catastrophes to illuminate the astonishing richness of human connection: a grandfather who thought he had found paradise—too soon—and now devotes himself to helping his neighbors rebuild their village; a husband so in love with his ailing wife that he carries her in his arms like a knight does his princess; and finally, Carrère himself, longtime chronicler of the tormented self, who unexpectedly finds consolation and even joy as he immerses himself in the lives of others.",,,10/30/09,September 13th 2011,[],ebook,"['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'France', 'Biography', 'Biography Memoir', 'French Literature', 'Roman', 'Death', 'Contemporary', 'Autobiography']",,9781429973281,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366111470l/11700593.jpg,4.06,[],171.0,2.0,,11700593-lives-other-than-my-own,,,,,94.0,3457.0,256,,Metropolitan Books,"['1278', '1336', '645', '162', '36']",,,[],,

Enrico Downer,There once was a Little England: A Story about Man's Obsession with 'Colour and Class',,English,,"Inspired by a true story. In Barbados in the 1950s in a stratified society of whites, blacks, and half-whites, the son of a working-class family is shot and killed. It happens on the private property of an English landlord. The Englishman claims he mistook the boy for a monkey and, for his defense in a court of law, he turns to a Barbadian lawyer, a member of the race he deems inferior to his own.The lawyer is faced with his own private dilemma. Should he defend the Englishman, face the scorn of the people and pander to the upper-class to which he yearns to belong? Is it worth the approbation of the upper-class and their money to turn his back on his own? Should he swallow his pride and disregard the white man's assault on his dignity and on his race?Meanwhile the people are stung by the humiliating monkey assertion from the lips of a white man.The lawyer enters the political arena and needs the majority vote of the working-class. But he has already cast his lot with the upper-class, the wealthy and privileged minority.In different ways the tragedy impacts the lives of the dead boy's parents, a God-fearing mother who leans on her Christian faith and a grieving father determined to avenge the killing of his beloved son.With bated breath the whole island awaits the day of the trial for their sense of justice to be vindicated.

Volver décadas después y retratar a un aprendiz de escritor en un permanente estado de desesperación impostada que imita a sus ídolos literarios en los cafés convierte a esta novela iniciática en un homenaje a la desilusión y la esperanza de los años de juventud. El joven Enrique Vila-Matas pasea por el barrio de Saint-Germain-des-Prés fingiendo ser un escritor maldito, espía la vida de bohemia de sus amigos artistas y escucha desconcertado los consejos de su casera en un francés superior que no entiende, mientras se despide de la poesía y de la felicidad de la escritura imaginaria. Enrique Vila-Matas incorpora un bellísimo prólogo a una de sus novelas más divertidas cuando se cumplen diez años de su publicación.

Enrique de Hériz,Lies,,English,,"Isabel Azuera, an anthropologist, is deep in the jungle of northern Guatemala. She has told everyone that she is doing field research, but in fact she has made the journey to escape her family. When she learns that she is believed to have died in a terrible boating accident and that her children have misidentified a mutilated body as her own, she decides to keep the truth hidden and remain “dead.” Alone in the jungle, she begins reassessing the lies and legends upon which the foundations of her family’s history have been constructed. Thousands of miles away, Isabel’s daughter, Serena, and the rest of the family have gathered at her parents’ beachhouse near Barcelona. Serena is keeping a diary and trying to make sense of her family and its history. Her voice echoes, enhances, and at times challenges her mother’s memories and perceptions. An intricately wrought, multilayered novel—and winner of the Premi Llibreter in Spain (The Bookseller’s Award)—LIES ranges from the present to deep into the past. As Isabel and Serena recount spellbinding tales of love affairs and scandals within the Azuera family, the lies and legends that have influenced generations gradually come to light. Interwoven into the narratives are beautifully-told digressions on the tribal customs and cultures, funerary rituals, and even the legends surrounding the eighth-century Chinese poet Li Po. Some of the stories are brutal, others droll, and still others exciting.

When it became clear to the fairy families that they could never win, they decided to move their civilisation underground and keep themselves hidden from the humans. All the fairy families agreed on this, except the eighth family, the demons.The demons planned to lift their small island out of time until they had regrouped and were ready to wage war on the humans once more. However, the time spell went wrong, and the island of Hybras was catapulted into Limbo, where it has remained for ten thousand years.Now, the tainted time spell is deteriorating and demons are being sucked back into the present space and time. The fairy Council are naturally concerned about this and are monitoring any materialisations. When the spell’s deterioration accelerates, the materialisations become unpredictable. Even the fairy scientists cannot figure out where the next demon will pop up.But someone can. Artemis Fowl, the teenage criminal mastermind, has solved temporal equations that no normal human should be intelligent enough to understand. But Artemis Fowl is no normal human.So when a confused and frightened demon pops up in a Sicilian theatre, Artemis Fowl is there to meet him. Unfortunately, he is not the only one. A second, mysterious party has also solved the temporal equations, and manages to abduct the demon before Artemis can secure him.This is a disaster for the fairy People, because this demon was no ordinary fairy.

Colfer's mythical world, which features a secret underground community populated by fairies, satyrs, trolls, and gnomes who frequently find themselves at odds with the above-ground humans, offers a perfect blend of humor, magic, fantasy, and conflict. In the first book of the series, Artemis battled both the underground inhabitants and Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon fairy police force. He also lost his beloved father, who is assumed to be dead. Now, after receiving a mysterious video email, Artemis finds himself in need of help from his recent enemies. The video shows a man bearing a striking resemblance to Artemis's father, sitting in the wasteland of arctic Russia. Artemis sets off to rescue the man, but first he must enlist some magical assistance. Down in the underground world, chaos has arisen. An unknown traitor has stolen forbidden weapons and armed a horde of trolls, setting them loose to wreak havoc on the citizens. Clues lead Captain Holly Short straight to Artemis, and she exacts a small bit of revenge by kidnapping him, just as he once kidnapped her. But soon she learns that Artemis isn't behind the chaos, and if she's to have any hope of stopping it, she will need his help. As a result, these onetime adversaries must now join forces -- a mix that proves to be both charming and volatile.Colfer has combined the magical appeal of Rowling's Harry Potter series with a fantasy world reminiscent of Tolkien's. By stirring a few intriguingly conflicted characters and lots of nonstop action into the mix, he's created a winning recipe guaranteed to keep young readers glued to the pages for hours.

Forceful, direct, and challenging, their central message is that the basis of happiness is up to us, and that we all have the capacity, through sustained reflection and hard work, of achieving this goal. They still speak eloquently to modern readers seeking meaning in their own lives.This is the only complete modern translation of the Discourses, together with the Handbook or manual of key themes, and surviving fragments.

"Epictetus, Sharon Lebell (Retold by)","The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness",,English,,"Epictetus was born into slavery about 55 C.E. in the eastern outreaches of the Roman Empire. Sold as a child and crippled from the beatings of his master, Epictetus was eventually freed, rising from his humble roots to establish an influential school of Stoic philosophy. Stressing that human beings cannot control life, only how they respond to it, Epictetus dedicated his life to outlining the simple way to happiness, fulfillment, and tranquility. By putting into practice the ninety-three witty, wise, and razor-sharp instructions that make up The Art of Living, readers learn to successfully meet the challenges of everyday life and face life's inevitable losses and disappointments with grace. Epictetus's teachings rank among the greatest wisdom texts of human civilization. Sharon Lebell presents this esteemed philosopher's invaluable insights for the first time in a splendidly down-to-earth rendition.

Epictetus;Nicholas P. White,The Handbook (The Encheiridion),,,Philosophy,"From the Introduction: ""Stoic philosophy, of which Epictetus (c. a.d. 50-130) is a representative, began as a recognizable movement around 300 b.c. Its founder was Zeno of Cytium (not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes). He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the Graeco-Roman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetus--and also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics; but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition.""",,,,1983.0,,,,0915145693,9780915145690,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9WRzxtTBkPgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,4.22,,,,,,,,,,,,35.0,,,,650.0,,,,
Epicurus,Letters and Sayings of Epicurus,,,,"Throughout the ages Epicurus has been both idealized and anathematized. As an atheist materialist philosopher he was an offense to religious thinkers. Many of his influential admirers, like Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Jefferson, had to keep their Epicurean leanings a secret. On the other hand, the philosopher-physicist Isaac Newton was candid enough to assert openly that he was reviving the tenets of the Epicurean philosophy when he embarked on his world-transforming project. Epicurus' significance transcends even his astounding historical influence because the subjects he reflected on - the purpose of life, the nature of reality, natural phenomena, and death - are of enduring significance.",,,10/29/00,December 31st 2005,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics']",,9780760763285,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266720229l/2308993.jpg,4.05,[],100.0,1.0,,2308993.Letters_and_Sayings_of_Epicurus,,,,,94.0,200.0,100,,Barnes & Noble,"['72', '79', '36', '12', '1']",,,[],,

Eric Blehm,The Last Season,,English,,"To pick up The Last Season is to lose oneself in a mesmerizing story about a place few could survive in and even fewer have visited -- the unforgiving backcountry of the Sierra Nevadas. Blehm narrates this true account of the disappearance and search for Randy Morgenson, a National Park Service ranger who, one morning after 28 seasons on the job, failed to answer his radio call. The introverted Morgenson was more comfortable with the natural world than with people. A gifted photographer and a lyrical writer, he dropped out of college to begin a career that would send him into the remote parts of California's Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Passionate about the mountains, he excelled at his responsibilities, which ranged from clearing away garbage left by careless campers to rescuing injured hikers. Dedicated to keeping the wilderness undisturbed, he was proud of his ability to leave no trace of himself wherever he camped.That skill would prove costly when, at age 54, he went missing. Blehm seamlessly combines a detective story with a celebration of nature that calls to mind the works of classic American writers like Thoreau and Emerson. His gripping narrative will cause readers' hearts to ache at the disappearance of this undervalued soul. But their spirits will soar at the grandeur and mysticism of nature expertly captured in its most primal state.",,,10/30/06,January 30th 2007,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Nature', 'Outdoors', 'Travel', 'Mystery', 'Survival', 'History', 'Audiobook']",,9780060583019,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440816389l/214091._SY475_.jpg,4.07,['National Outdoor Book Award for History/Biography (2006)'],179.0,2.0,,214091.The_Last_Season,,,,,96.0,8188.0,384,,Harper Perennial,"['2932', '3350', '1547', '272', '87']",,,[],,
Eric Blehm,Fearless: The Heroic Story of One Navy SEAL's Sacrifice in the Hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the Unwavering Devotion of the Woman Who Loved Him,,English,,"Fearless takes you deep into SEAL Team SIX, straight to the heart of one of its most legendary operators. When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn’t know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan—but he was ready: In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote, “I’m not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.” Long before Adam Brown became a member of the elite SEAL Team SIX—the counterterrorism unit that took down Osama bin Laden—he was a fun-loving country boy from Hot Springs, Arkansas, whose greatest goal had been to wear his high school’s football jersey. An undersized daredevil, prone to jumping off roofs into trees and off bridges into lakes, Adam was a kid who broke his own bones but would never break apromise to his parents. But after high school, Adam fell in with the wrong crowd, and his family watched as his appetite for risk dragged him into a downward spiral that eventually landed him in jail. Battling his inner demons on a last-chance road to redemption, Adam had one goal: to become the best of the best—a U.S. Navy SEAL. An absorbing chronicle of heroism and humanity, Fearless presents an indelible portrait of a highly trained warrior who would enter a village with weapons in hand to hunt terrorists, only to come back the next day with an armload of shoes and meals for local children. It is a deeply personal, revealing glimpse inside the SEAL Team SIX brotherhood that also shows how these elite operators live out the rest of their lives, away from danger, as husbands, fathers, and friends. Fearless is the story of a man of extremes, whose courage and determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It’s about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. Always the first to volunteer for the most dangerous assignments, Adam’s final act of bravery led to the ultimate sacrifice. Adam Brown was a devoted man who was an unlikely hero but a true warrior, described by all who knew him as fearless.",,,,May 22nd 2012,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Biography', 'War', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Christian', 'Military History', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook']",,9780307730695,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351386173l/12878300.jpg,4.55,"['Audie Award for Inspirational/Faith-Based Nonfiction (2013)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2012)']",199.0,2.0,,12878300-fearless,,,,,98.0,14779.0,256,,The Doubleday Religious Publishing Group,"['10059', '3280', '1088', '232', '120']",,,['Arkansas (United States)'],,

Eric Clapton,Clapton: The Autobiography,,English,,"I found a pattern in my behavior that had been repeating itself for years, decades even. Bad choices were my specialty, and if something honest and decent came along, I would shun it or run the other way.”With striking intimacy and candor, Eric Clapton tells the story of his eventful and inspiring life in this poignant and honest autobiography. More than a rock star, he is an icon, a living embodiment of the history of rock music. Well known for his reserve in a profession marked by self-promotion, flamboyance, and spin, he now chronicles, for the first time, his remarkable personal and professional journeys. Born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents, Eric never knew his father and, until the age of nine, believed his actual mother to be his sister. In his early teens his solace was the guitar, and his incredible talent would make him a cult hero in the clubs of Britain and inspire devoted fans to scrawl “Clapton is God” on the walls of London’s Underground. With the formation of Cream, the world's first supergroup, he became a worldwide superstar, but conflicting personalities tore the band apart within two years. His stints in Blind Faith, in Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, and in Derek and the Dominos were also short-lived but yielded some of the most enduring songs in history, including the classic “Layla.” During the late sixties he played as a guest with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan, as well as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and longtime friend George Harrison. It was while working with the latter that he fell for George’s wife, Pattie Boyd, a seemingly unrequited love that led him to the depths of despair, self-imposed seclusion, and drug addiction. By the early seventies he had overcome his addiction and released the bestselling album 461 Ocean Boulevard, with its massive hit “I Shot the Sheriff.” He followed that with the platinum album Slowhand, which included “Wonderful Tonight,” the touching love song to Pattie, whom he finally married at the end of 1979. A short time later, however, Eric had replaced heroin with alcohol as his preferred vice, following a pattern of behavior that not only was detrimental to his music but contributed to the eventual breakup of his marriage. In the eighties he would battle and begin his recovery from alcoholism and become a father. But just as his life was coming together, he was struck by a terrible blow: His beloved four-year-old son, Conor, died in a freak accident. At an earlier time Eric might have coped with this tragedy by fleeing into a world of addiction. But now a much stronger man, he took refuge in music, responding with the achingly beautiful “Tears in Heaven.”Clapton is the powerfully written story of a survivor, a man who has achieved the pinnacle of success despite extraordinary demons. It is one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.",,,01/01/07,October 9th 2007,"['George Harrison', 'Pattie Boyd', 'Eric Clapton']",Hardcover,"['Music', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Rock N Roll', 'Music Biography']",,9780385518512,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407042555l/1207904.jpg,3.83,[],69.0,1.0,,1207904.Clapton,,,,,91.0,24024.0,343,,Broadway,"['7010', '8674', '6137', '1670', '533']",,,[],,

Eric Evans,Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software,,English,,"""Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are addressing. ""His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique. ""The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this book as essential reading for software developers--it is a future classic."" --Ralph Johnson, author of Design Patterns ""If you don't think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming, this book will tell you what you've forgotten to do. ""Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion."" --Dave Collins, author of Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces  ""Eric weaves real-world experience modeling--and building--business applications into a practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, Eric's descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field."" --Luke Hohmann, author of Beyond Software Architecture  ""This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer."" --Kent Beck ""What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is important."" --Kyle Brown, author of Enterprise Java(TM) Programming with IBM(R) WebSphere(R) The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process.  Domain-Driven Design  fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer.  Domain-Driven Design  then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:Getting all team members to speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain object Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model Applying analysis patterns Relating design patterns to the model Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.",,,,August 20th 2003,[],Hardcover,"['Programming', 'Technology', 'Software', 'Computer Science', 'Technical', 'Nonfiction', 'Design', 'Architecture', 'Coding', 'Engineering']",,9780321125217,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1287493789l/179133.jpg,4.15,[],100.0,1.0,,179133.Domain_Driven_Design,,,,,94.0,4139.0,560,,Addison-Wesley Professional,"['1816', '1451', '637', '161', '74']",,,[],,

So, when Gustavus invades Poland, managing to unite all the squabbling Polish factions into repelling the common enemy, the time-lost Americans have to worry about getting dragged into the fight along with the Swedish forces. But Mike Stearns has another problem. He was Prime Minister of the USE until he lost an election, and now he’s one of Gustavus’s generals; and he has demonstrated that he’s very good at being a general. And he’s about to really need all his military aptitude. Gretchen , who never saw a revolution she didn’t like, has been arrested in Saxony, and is likely to be executed. The revolutionary groups which she has been working with are not about to let that happen, and suddenly there’s rioting in the streets. Saxony’s ruthless General Baner is determined to suppress the uprising by the time-honored “kill them all and let God sort them out” method, which only adds fuel to the fire. So Gustavus orders Mike Stearns to go to Saxony and restore order. But he makes one mistake.He didn’t tell Mike to take his troops along on the mission. But he didn’t tell him not to, either . . .",Ring of Fire Main Line Novels #5,,,March 29th 2011,"['Mike Stearns', 'Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden', 'Gretchen Richter', 'Rebecca Abrananel', 'General Johan Banér', 'Axel Oxenstierna', 'Wilhelm Wettin']",Hardcover,"['Alternate History', 'Science Fiction', 'Time Travel', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', '17th Century', 'Science Fiction Fantasy']",,9781439134252,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388632869l/8721228.jpg,4.05,[],31.0,1.0,,8721228-1636,,,,,96.0,1392.0,416,,Baen,"['463', '593', '281', '46', '9']",,,[],,

Eric Greitens,"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL",,English,,"«La pace non è solo assenza di guerra, e una buona vita non significa solo assenza di sofferenza. Una buona pace, una pace in cui le comunità possano svilupparsi, può essere costruita solo quando chiediamo a noi stessi e agli altri di essere un po' più che buoni, un po' meglio che forti. E una buona vita, una vita in cui si può godere il mondo e vivere con uno scopo, la si può costruire solo se non ci limitiamo a vivere per noi stessi.» Il cuore e il pugno racconta il percorso di formazione di un uomo con un passato di combattente, Eric Greitens, oggi impegnato in politica come governatore del Missouri, che ha cercato di dare un senso alla propria esistenza a partire da questi princìpi.Una volta resosi conto che la comoda vita dello studente universitario gli andava stretta, Eric decide di girare il mondo in cerca di avventure, ma ben presto, dopo una deludente esperienza di insegnante in Cina, che nel 1993 presentava ancora tratti terribilmente simili a quella della strage di piazza Tienanmen, capisce che non è di questo che ha bisogno, ma di una strada da seguire. E così inizia a prestare servizio volontario in prima linea su diversi fronti umanitari: nei campi profughi in una Bosnia insanguinata dalle campagne di pulizia etnica, a fianco degli orfani dello spaventoso genocidio in Ruanda e dei bambini di strada in Bolivia, e infine in India a sostegno della missione di Madre Teresa.Ma più accumula esperienze, più si rende conto di una verità per lui incontrovertibile: di fronte a una minaccia concreta, l'uso della forza diventa una necessità. Decide allora di intraprendere la carriera militare sottoponendosi al terribile addestramento dei Navy SEAL, il corpo d'élite della Marina statunitense, che poi guiderà in molteplici missioni tra Afghanistan, Sudest asiatico, Kenya e Iraq, fra attacchi brutali e indicibili sofferenze, incontri strazianti, ma anche mirabili esempi di spirito di gruppo, solidarietà e fratellanza.È al termine e al prezzo di questo lungo e accidentato itinerario, dice Greitens, che il segreto di una «buona vita» gli si è rivelato nella sua paradossale semplicità, cioè quando ha finalmente capito che la compassione - il cuore - senza la forza vacilla, e che la forza - il pugno - senza la compassione è solo un colpo vibrato nel vuoto.",,,11/06/11,April 11th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'War', 'History', 'Leadership', 'Biography Memoir', 'Military History', 'Politics']",,9780547424859,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348258902l/9525402.jpg,4.13,[],88.0,1.0,,9525402-the-heart-and-the-fist,,,,,95.0,8681.0,320,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,"['3695', '3056', '1480', '297', '153']",,,[],,

Without a sense of purpose, plagued by PTSD, and masking his pain with heavy drinking, he needed help. Zach and Eric started writing and talking nearly every day, as Eric set down his thoughts on what it takes to build resilience in our lives.Eric's letters drawing on both his own experience and wisdom from ancient and modern thinkers are now gathered and edited into this timeless guidebook. Resilience explains how we can build purpose, confront pain, practice compassion, develop a vocation, find a mentor, create happiness, and much more.

At once a modern classic of travel literature and a gripping adventure story, Stranger in the Forest provides a rare and intimate look at the vanishing way of life of one of the last surviving groups of rain forest dwellers.

Eric J. Evans,"The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783-1870",,English,,"'Evans's elegant and fluent treatment is quite superb.' Times Educational Supplement In this hugely ambitious and wide-ranging history of Britain, Eric Evans surveys a period in which Britain was transformed into the world's first industrial, while the foundations of the largest empire the world had seen were also being securely laid. This was an era of unprecedented political crisis, economic opportunity and social upheaval unparalleled in Britain, yet one during which transformation was achieved without revolution. The unique and potent combination of transition and transformation is a major theme in this book.   The book ranges ranges across key political, diplomatic, social, cultural, economic and religious themes in a series of short, lively chapters whose purpose is to convey the overall drama of hectic change which stopped well short of political revolution.  Britain was still ruled by wealthy landonwners in 1870 as it had been in 1783.  The world over which they presided, however, had been transformed utterly.  It had become an urban, industrial and commercial society, a change achieved without revolution.  [Evans examines whether their success in doing so was due more to good management than good fortune.] This new edition includes a new and revisionist introductory chapter and a thoroughly updated bibliography.  The book appears with illustrations for the first time. Eric J.

Eric J. Hobsbawm,Echoes of the Marseillaise,Two Centuries Look Back on the French Revolution,,History,"""The French Revolution,"" writes Hobsbawm, ""gave peoples the sense that history could be changed by their action ... [and] demonstrated the power of the common people in a manner which no subsequent government has ever allowed itself to forget."" We can learn a great deal from studying the French Revolution itself, but we can also learn from studying the ways in which scholars have interpreted the French Revolution, and from the ways their views have changed. For over a century following the Revolution, commentators and scholars spoke of it in glowing terms. But in the past three decades, revisionist historians have become skeptical. Eric Hobsbawm reiterates the centrality of the Revolution for history on a global basis. He argues that those who wrote about the Revolution in the nineteenth century were convinced it had changed their lives dramatically, improving the economy and the lot of peasants. They saw the Revolution as a prototype of of the bourgeois revolution, enabling the middle class to gain power from the ruling class of aristocrats. Many believed proletarian revolutions would inevitably follow. In the years between 1917 and the 1960s, Marxists continued to use the French Revolution as a point of reference, paying increasing attention to the social and economic factors in the Revolution, not only to the political factors. In the 1970s and 1980s, many historians began to argue that the Revolution achieved modest results at disproportionate costs. Hobsbawm argues that this massive historiographical reaction against the centrality of the Revolution reflects the personal politics of those contemporary historians for whom Marxism and communism are now out of favor. They are, he maintains, wrong. The Revolution transformed the world permanently and introduced forces that continue to transform it.",,,,1990.0,,,,0813515246,9780813515243,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3-XRo-PSwsQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3.51,,,,,,,,,,,,168.0,,,,54.0,,,,

Hobsbawm took E.M. Forster to hear Lenny Bruce, demonstrated with Bertrand Russell against nuclear arms, translated for Che Guevara in Havana, and inaugurated the modern history of banditry.

Sterling (Contributor),Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman,,English,,"Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, the third volume in the Dialogue series, covers six major and controversial topics dealing with Miller's classic play. The topics include feminism and the role of women in the drama, the American Dream, business and capitalism, the significance of technology, the legacy that Willy leaves to Biff, and Miller's use of symbolism. The authors of the essays include prominent Arthur Miller scholars such as Terry Otten and the late Steven Centola as well as young, emerging scholars. Some of the essays, particularly the ones written by the emerging scholars, tend to employ literary theory while the ones by the established scholars tend to illustrate the strengths of traditional criticism by interpreting the text closely. It is fascinating to see how scholars at different stages of their academic careers approach a given topic from distinct perspectives and sometimes diverse methodologies.

Otherwise you're just getting in my way or bothering me. Don't be weird.

That's why she created the Rules: Don't treat her any differently just because she's blind, and never take advantage. There will be no second chances. Just ask Scott Kilpatrick, the boy who broke her heart. When Scott suddenly reappears in her life after being gone for years, Parker knows there's only one way to react - shun him so hard it hurts. She has enough on her mind already, like trying out for the track team (that's right, her eyes don't work but her legs still do), doling out tough-love advice to her painfully naive classmates, and giving herself gold stars for every day she hasn't cried since her dad's death three months ago. But avoiding her past quickly proves impossible, and the more Parker learns about what really happened - both with Scott, and her dad - the more she starts to question if things are always as they seem.

Eric Martin (Goodreads Author),Liberation Day: Our Nation Empowered by the Constitution,,,,"
  Liberation Day
-it's a title suited to a story of a nation at war and a people held captive. In this case, the invader is not some foreign enemy. It is the government at war with the nation it governs. And the Liberation Day this book speaks of is the day we take our nation back-back from a federal government that has long defied the constitutional restraints that guarantee our freedom.In Liberation Day, Eric Martin shows us how our Constitution can and must be used to make us and the states in which we live prosperous, powerful, and free as they were meant to be. Martin lays out a rationally innovative plan that radically downsizes or completely dissolves more than 250 federal entities that wield power both unconscionable and unconstitutional.With its unconstitutional burdens rightfully jettisoned, our federal government will align at last with the Founding Law that makes us and our states truly free. The framers of the Constitution understood only too well that government is by its nature a beast, of use if properly restrained, but oppressive and even lethal if allowed out of bounds. By reapplying to government the well-wrought chains of our Constitution, we will liberate ourselves.Sam Adams said it best nearly two and a half centuries ago: ""It does not take a majority to prevail ... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.""

Five hundred years after Luther’s now famous Ninety-five Theses appeared, Eric Metaxas, acclaimed biographer of the bestselling Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy and Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery, paints a startling portrait of the wild figure whose adamantine faith cracked the edifice of Western Christendom and dragged medieval Europe into the future. Written in riveting prose and impeccably researched, Martin Luther tells the searing tale of a humble man who, by bringing ugly truths to the highest seats of power, caused the explosion whose sound is still ringing in our ears. Luther’s monumental faith and courage gave birth to the ideals of liberty, equality, and individualism that today lie at the heart of all modern life.",,+ 16 pages of plates,,October 3rd 2017,[],Hardcover,"['Biography', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'Theology', 'Church History', 'Faith', 'Audiobook']",,9781101980019,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490860536l/34348320.jpg,4.15,[],99.0,1.0,,34348320-martin-luther,,,,,93.0,5009.0,480,,Viking,"['2245', '1787', '607', '200', '170']",,,[],,
Eric Metaxas (Goodreads Author),"Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy",,English,,"As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together,"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years, ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life―the theologian and the spy―to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In a deeply moving narrative, Metaxas uses previously unavailable documents―including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts―to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen.In ""Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy""―""A Righteous Gentile vs the Third Reich,"" Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching 1939 decision to leave the safe haven of America for Hitler's Germany, and using extended excerpts from love letters and coded messages written to and from Bonhoeffer's Cell 92, Metaxas tells for the first time the full story of Bonhoeffer's passionate and tragic romance.Readers will discover fresh insights and revelations about his life-changing months at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and about his radical position on why Christians are obliged to stand up for the Jews. Metaxas also sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's reaction to Kristallnacht, his involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in ""Operation 7,"" the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.""Bonhoeffer"" gives witness to one man's extraordinary faith and to the tortured fate of the nation he sought to deliver from the curse of Nazism. It brings the reader face to face with a man determined to do the will of God radically, courageously, and joyfully―even to the point of death.

Eric Nuzum (Goodreads Author),The Dead Travel Fast: Stalking Vampires from Nosferatu to Count Chocula,,English,,"The Dead Travel Fast is about vampires, death, chickens, fear, things that smell bad, the love of a good woman, and germs… but mostly it's about vampires.The undead are everywhere. They're not just in movies and books, but in commercials, fetish clubs, and even in your breakfast cereal. If you look, you'll discover that bloodsuckers have gone from guest spots in rural folk tales to becoming some of the most recognizable bad guys in the modern world. Eric Nuzum wanted to find out why and how this happened. And he found the answer in Goth clubs, darkened parks, haunted houses, and… chain restaurants.  Nuzum was willing to do whatever it took to better understand the vampire phenomenon. He traveled across Transylvania on a tour hosted by Butch Patrick (a.k.a. Eddie Munster), sat through Las Vegas' only topless vampire revue, hung out with assorted shady characters, and spent hours in a coffin. He even drank his own blood --just one more step in his quest to understand the weird, offbeat world of vampires and the people who love them. The Dead Travel Fast is the hilarious result of this bloody, gory, and often foolhardy journey. With his unmatched firsthand experience, Eric Nuzum delivers a far-reaching look at vampires in pop culture, from Bram to Bela to Buffy, and at what vampires and vampirism have come to mean to us today.  And the blood?

As Warren desperately tries to conceal a failing real estate venture, his family falls prey to secrets and misunderstandings, both hilarious and painful, that open fault lines in their intimacy. Their misguided attempts to recover their former closeness, or find it elsewhere, lead them into late-night burglary, improbable romance, and strange acts of betrayal. When tragedy strikes, the Zillers are forced to move to one of the houses in Warren’s abandoned development in the desert.

But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on ""validated learning,"" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late.

  The Human-Covenant war rages on as the alien juggernaut sweeps inexorably toward its final goal: destruction of all human life!
Halo has been destroyed, and the threat it posed to sentient life, neutralized. But victory has come at a terrible cost for the UNSC. Thousands of valiant soldiers fell in the battle to prevent the alien construct from falling into the enemy’s clutches. Now, everything depends on the Spartan known as the “Master Chief.” Yet even with the aid of the artificial intelligence Cortana, the Master Chief will be hard-pressed to rescue survivors and evade the Covenant ships patrolling the remains of Halo in debris-strewn space. Ahead lies a dangerous voyage home, through a gauntlet of Covenant forces. For the sake of all, the Master Chief and his war-torn squad must not only survive, but take the fight to the enemy with a decisive first strike.This novel is based on a Mature-rated video game.Bungie, Halo, Xbox, the Microsoft Game Studios logo and the Xbox Logos are registered trademarks or trademarks of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.

Eric Schlosser,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,,English,,"Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape, widened the chasm between rich and poor, fueled an epidemic of obesity, and propelled American cultural imperialism abroad. That's a lengthy list of charges, but here Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of first-rate reportage, wry wit, and careful reasoning.Schlosser's myth-shattering survey stretches from California's subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many fast food's flavors are concocted. Along the way, he unearths a trove of fascinating, unsettling truths -- from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production, popular culture, and even real estate.

Eric Schlosser,"Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety",,English,,"A myth-shattering exposé of America’s nuclear weaponsFamed investigative journalist Eric Schlosser digs deep to uncover secrets about the management of America’s nuclear arsenal. A groundbreaking account of accidents, near misses, extraordinary heroism, and technological breakthroughs, Command and Control explores the dilemma that has existed since the dawn of the nuclear age: How do you deploy weapons of mass destruction without being destroyed by them? That question has never been resolved—and Schlosser reveals how the combination of human fallibility and technological complexity still poses a grave risk to mankind. While the harms of global warming increasingly dominate the news, the equally dangerous yet more immediate threat of nuclear weapons has been largely forgotten.Written with the vibrancy of a first-rate thriller, Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a nuclear missile silo in rural Arkansas with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years. It depicts the urgent effort by American scientists, policy makers, and military officers to ensure that nuclear weapons can’t be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently. Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust. At the heart of the book lies the struggle, amid the rolling hills and small farms of Damascus, Arkansas, to prevent the explosion of a ballistic missile carrying the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States.Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with people who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view. Through the details of a single accident, Schlosser illustrates how an unlikely event can become unavoidable, how small risks can have terrible consequences, and how the most brilliant minds in the nation can only provide us with an illusion of control. Audacious, gripping, and unforgettable, Command and Control is a tour de force of investigative journalism, an eye-opening look at the dangers of America’s nuclear age.",,,October 1st 2009,September 17th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Science', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'American History', 'Technology', 'Military History', 'Audiobook']",,9781594202278,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366560404l/6452798.jpg,4.26,"['Pulitzer Prize Nominee for History (2014)', 'California Book Award for Nonfiction (Gold) (2013)', 'Lionel Gelber Prize Nominee (2014)', 'Duke of Westminster Medal for Military Literature Nominee (2014)', 'Andrew Carnegie Medal Nominee for Nonfiction (2014)']",28.0,1.0,,6452798-command-and-control,,,,,97.0,10245.0,656,,Penguin Books,"['4661', '4024', '1240', '225', '95']",,,[],,

Eric Van Lustbader,Mistress of the Pearl,,English,,"Kundala is Miina's world, created by that Goddess with the help of the dragons. But Miina is missing, and her people have been enslaved by the alien V'ornn. Now a savior has come, the Dar Sala-at, a messiah promised by prophecy yet unlike anyone's expectations: within the body of a beautiful young woman is the mind and spirit of a unique Kundalan female who is joined in mystical partnership with the mind and spirit of Annon Ashera, a V'ornn male, the last survivor of a noble family. Together the two adolescents have matured and merged into a new joint identity. Now their common destiny, and Kundala's, is in their own hands.In Lustbader's richly imagined saga The Pearl, magic and science clash on an epic scale. As in the Midkemia novels of Raymond Feist, the juxtaposition shows that neither is inherently good or evil. It is the people using magic or science who give them meaning, and Lustbader has created people you will never forget: Riane, the Dar-Sala-at; Eleana, the woman she loves twice over; Kurgan, the V'ornn usurper who raped Eleana and sired her child; Marethyn Stogggul, Kurgan's defiant sister, an artist who joins the Kundalan resistance; Marethyn's lover, chief trader Sornnn SaTrryn, who secretly helps the resistance as well; and the fabulous Krystren, the Sarakkon woman from the mysterious southern continent, who comes north on a secret mission and will change the lives of everyone she meets. All the while, the evil Sauromicians threaten the world as they seek to use banestones to bind a dragon.With each new volume, The Pearl has bloomed and ramified like a gorgeous flowering vine.

In the process, Bourne begins to question who he really is and what he would become if he no longer carried the Bourne identity. Across the globe, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt-apparently by an Iranian missile-leaving the world wondering if it was an accident or an act of aggression.

Eric Weiner (Goodreads Author),The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,,English,,"Weiner spent a decade as a foreign correspondent reporting from such discontented locales as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Indonesia. Unhappy people living in profoundly unstable states, he notes, inspire pathos and make for good copy, but not for good karma. So Weiner, admitted grump and self-help book aficionado, undertook a year's research to travel the globe, looking for the ""unheralded happy places."" The result is this book, equal parts laugh-out-loud funny and philosophical, a journey into both the definition of and the destination for true contentment.Apparently, the happiest places on earth include, somewhat unexpectedly, Iceland, Bhutan, and India. Weiner also visits the country deemed most malcontent, Moldova, and finds real merit in the claim.But the question remains: What makes people happy? Is it the freedom of the West or the myriad restrictions of Singapore? The simple ashrams of India or the glittering shopping malls of Qatar?From the youthful drunkenness of Iceland to the despond of Slough, a sad but resilient town in Heathrow's flight path, Weiner offers wry yet profound observations about the way people relate to circumstance and fate.Both revealing and inspirational, perhaps the best thing about this hilarious trip across four continents is that for the reader, the ""geography of bliss"" is wherever they happen to find themselves while reading it.",,,10/28/08,January 28th 2008,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Psychology', 'Humor', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Book Club']",,9780446580267,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347304179l/1918305.jpg,3.83,['Borders Original Voices Award for Nonfiction (2008)'],646.0,7.0,,1918305.The_Geography_of_Bliss,,,,,92.0,32094.0,335,,Twelve,"['8535', '12955', '7913', '1984', '707']",,,[],,

"Erich Fromm, Rainer Funk (Foreword by)",The Art of Being,,English,,"Between 1974 and 1976, while working on the book To Have Or to Be? at his home in Locarno, Switzerland, the aged Erich Fromm wrote far more manuscript and chapters than were actually used in the book, which was published in 1976. Some of these chapters are contained in the present volume. They deal entirely with the ""steps toward being"" that the individual can take in order to learn the Art of Being. How can we realize and actualize Love, Reason, and meaningful, productive work? Fromm here offers the Art of Being, a way of living based on authentic self-awareness that comes only through honest self-analysis. Wisely, he warns of the pitfalls of our attaining enlightenment without effort, or believing that life can be lived without pain. The tantalizing ""spiritual smorgasbord"" offered by our consumer-oriented world, Fromm maintains, only feeds our illusions of ""easy awareness."" Confronting the psycho-Gurus who preach these shortcuts to enlightenment, Fromm offers another way to self-awareness and well-being, one based on psychoanalysis and self-awareness through meditation. If the Art of Being - the art of functioning as a whole person - can be considered the supreme goal of life, a breakthrough occurs when we move from narcissistic selfishness and egotism - from having - to psychological and spiritual happiness - being. The Art of Being will be one of the most important works in the Fromm canon for years to come.",,,11/06/89,September 1st 1994,[],Paperback,"['Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'German Literature', 'Personal Development', 'Psychoanalysis']",,9780826406736,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358709583l/25492.jpg,4.09,[],84.0,1.0,,25492.The_Art_of_Being,,,,,95.0,3313.0,144,,Bloomsbury Academic,"['1291', '1218', '630', '155', '19']",,,[],,

Erich Kempka,I Was Hitler's Chauffeur : The Memoir of Erich Kempka,,English,,"Erich Kempka served as Hitler's personal driver from 1934 through to the Fuhrer's dramatic suicide in 1945. His candid memoirs offer a unique eyewitness account of events leading up to and during the war, culminating in those dark final days in the Fuhrer's headquarters, deep under the shattered city of Berlin.He begins by describing his duties as a member of Hitler's personal staff in the years preceding the war, driving the Fuhrer throughout Germany and abroad, and accompanying him to rallies. The crux of his memoirs however covers his life with Hitler in the Berlin Fuhrerbunker. During this time he was responsible for a transport fleet of cars, and often drove the likes of Speer or Kesselring on inspection tours to the hot spots on the front; and in March 1945, he accompanied the Fuhrer to his final front-inspection tour. Kempka was also present when news came through of Goring and Himmler's efforts to seize power and negotiate a truce with the Western Allies.Crucially, Kempka also witnessed Hitler's marriage to Eva Braun, and his last dinner and personal farewell to all those present, before he and his wife committed suicide. Hitler's final order to Kempka was that he have ready enough petrol to burn him and his wife. Under constant Soviet artillery fire, Kempke, Linge and others poured petrol over the bodies and burnt them.The account concludes with Kempka's hazardous escape out of a burning Berlin more than 800 km through enemy-occupied Germany, home to find his wife at BE.

Erich Kästner,Fabian. Die Geschichte eines Moralisten,,German,,"Erich Kästner kennen viele nur als Autor von Kinder- und Jugendbüchern. Dass er auch zeitkritische Romane geschrieben hat, wissen die wenigsten. Der Roman Fabian entstand 1931 und beschreibt den moralischen und geistigen Verfall inmitten schwieriger politischer Verhältnisse. Für Kästner gehen in dieser Zeit politischer und moralischer Verfall der Gesellschaft Hand in Hand. Fabian ist ein arbeitsloser Germanist, der durch die Großstadt Berlin zieht auf der Suche nach Arbeit, auf der Suche nach Kontakten. Wir erleben mit, wie er Menschen trifft, die ihn kaufen wollen, wie sich seine Freundin prostituiert, um Schauspielerin zu werden. Sein bester Freund begeht Selbstmord wegen einer lächerlichen Bemerkung. Ein Erfinder tritt auf, der seine Erfindungen, die Arbeitsplätze vernichtet haben, zurücknehmen will, was nicht geht. Die Stadt ist in Auflösung begriffen, die Menschen leben wie in einem Irrenhaus, einem hoffnungslosen, unbarmherzigen Labyrinth. Fabian ist ein Außenseiter, ein Moralist, seine Waffe ist die Beobachtung, die Distanz, die durch sarkastische Bemerkungen hergestellt wird. Sein Anspruch besteht darin, zuzusehen, ""ob die Welt Talent zur Anständigkeit hat"". Kästner stellt dem Moralisten Fabian, ein Mensch übrigens, der moralisch integer ist, ohne dass ihm dies als Lebensentwurf bewusst ist oder er den Zeigefinger erhebt, menschliche Korrumpierbarkeit, Gewissenlosigkeit und Anpassung entgegen. So finden sich im Buch eine ganze Reihe von wirklich gelungenen satirischen Spitzen, wie z.B. eine Tombola, bei der Nahrungsmittel verlost werden oder eine Pöbelei von Menschen als Abendunterhaltung. Kästners Beschreibungen der Menschen sind bissig und schonungslos. Charakteristisch für die Moral der Menschen ist das Verhalten des Redakteurs Müntzer, der etwas unterstützt, an das er nicht glaubt und dessen Falschheit er durchschaut. Von Müntzer heißt es, dass er sein Gewissen chloroformiert hat.  Fabian ist ein Roman mit vielen wirklich gelungenen zeitkritischen Beobachtungen, die auch heute nichts von ihrer Aktualität verloren haben. Schließlich steht im Zentrum von Kästners Gesellschaftskritik die menschliche Schwäche, die Lethargie, genau um die Falschheit der Verhältnisse zu wissen, aber nichts dagegen zu tun -- und diese Kritik hat auch heute nichts von seiner Berechtigung verloren. --Christoph Steven",,,10/28/31,February 1st 1989,"['Fabian', 'Labude']",Paperback,"['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Germany', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction']",,9783423110068,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1294313186l/1131999.jpg,4.13,[],277.0,3.0,,1131999.Fabian_Die_Geschichte_eines_Moralisten,,,,,95.0,3735.0,256,,Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag,"['1536', '1374', '631', '161', '33']",,,"['Berlin (Germany)', 'Germany']",,

Both have irritated officials for outstaying their two-week sojourn in Czechoslovakia. And so they must leave. Not that either has any place to go. Not in 1939. But when a man is led by a guard to the border of one country, he must try another. Until he is escorted from that one too.Living hand-to-mouth, selling shoelaces and safety pins for a few pennies, Steiner and Kern find that, remarkably, there are still pleasures to be had. Paris, for one; love, for another. For amid the heartless cruelty and cold-blooded laws of the Nazi state, there is still humanity and kindness.

Erik Davis,"TechGnosis: Myth, Magic Mysticism in the Age of Information",,English,,"How does our fascination with technology intersect with the religious imagination? In TechGnosis - a cult classic now updated and reissued with a new afterword - Erik Davis argues that while the realms of the digital and the spiritual may seem worlds apart, esoteric and religious impulses have in fact always permeated (and sometimes inspired) technological communication. Davis uncovers startling connections between such seemingly disparate topics as electricity and alchemy; online role-playing games and religious and occult practices; virtual reality and gnostic mythology; programming languages and Kabbalah. The final chapters address the apocalyptic dreams that haunt technology, providing vital historical context as well as new ways to think about a future defined by the mutant intermingling of mind and machine, nightmare and fantasy.",,,1998,November 12th 2004,[],Paperback,"['Technology', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Science', 'Religion', 'Spirituality', 'Cultural', 'History', 'Mysticism', 'Theory']",,9781852427726,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388625540l/206998.jpg,4.11,[],46.0,1.0,,206998.TechGnosis,,,,,94.0,506.0,448,,Serpent's Tail,"['205', '187', '86', '19', '9']",,,[],,

This is the story of the men and women whose lives it irrevocably changed and of two men in particular- an architect and a serial killer.The architect is Daniel Burnham, a man of great integrity and depth. It was his vision of the fair that attracted the best minds and talents of the day. The killer is Henry H. Holmes. Intelligent as well as handsome and charming, Holmes opened a boarding house which he advertised as 'The World's Fair Hotel'. Here in the neighbourhood where he was admired and liked by all, he seduced, tortured and murdered young women, incinerating them in the furnace he had built in the basement of his hotel.Spicing the narrative are the sad, charming and funny stories of a supporting cast of historical characters including Buffalo Bill, Scott Joplin, Theodore Dreiser and George Ferris, the steel tycoon whose mammoth wheel became America's answer to the Eiffel tower.

Erik Larson (Goodreads Author),"In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin",,English,,"The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America's first ambassador to Hitler's Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the New Germany, she has one affair after another, including with the surprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler's true character and ruthless ambition.Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Goring and the expectedly charming—yet wholly sinister—Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.",,,,May 10th 2011,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Germany', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Holocaust', 'Politics']",,9780307408846,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327864303l/9938498.jpg,3.85,"['Washington State Book Award for History/General Nonfiction (2012)', 'Chautauqua Prize Nominee (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for History & Biography (2011)']",427.0,6.0,,9938498-in-the-garden-of-beasts,,,,,93.0,160937.0,448,,Crown,"['42308', '66285', '40355', '9310', '2679']",,,['Berlin (Germany)'],,
Erik Larson (Goodreads Author),Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,,English,,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.

Mere hours later, Galveston found itself submerged in a monster hurricane that completely destroyed the town and killed over six thousand people in what remains the greatest natural disaster in American history--and Isaac Cline found himself the victim of a devastating personal tragedy.Using Cline's own telegrams, letters, and reports, the testimony of scores of survivors, and our latest understanding of the science of hurricanes, Erik Larson builds a chronicle of one man's heroic struggle and fatal miscalculation in the face of a storm of unimaginable magnitude.

Erik Larson (Goodreads Author),"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America",,English,,"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe",,First Edition,10/28/03,02/11/03,"['Daniel Burnham', 'H.H.

Erik Larson (Goodreads Author),Thunderstruck,,English,,"The interwoven stories of two men whose lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time - Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication.A true story of love, murder, and the end of the world’s “great hush” In Thunderstruck, Erik Larson tells the interwoven stories of two men—Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication—whose lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time. Set in Edwardian London and on the stormy coasts of Cornwall, Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia, Thunderstruck evokes the dynamism of those years when great shipping companies competed to build the biggest, fastest ocean liners, scientific advances dazzled the public with visions of a world transformed, and the rich outdid one another with ostentatious displays of wealth. Against this background, Marconi races against incredible odds and relentless skepticism to perfect his invention: the wireless, a prime catalyst for the emergence of the world we know today. Meanwhile, Crippen, “the kindest of men,” nearly commits the perfect crime. With his superb narrative skills, Erik Larson guides these parallel narratives toward a relentlessly suspenseful meeting on the waters of the North Atlantic. Along the way, he tells of a sad and tragic love affair that was described on the front pages of newspapers around the world, a chief inspector who found himself strangely sympathetic to the killer and his lover, and a driven and compelling inventor who transformed the way we communicate. Thunderstruck presents a vibrant portrait of an era of séances, science, and fog, inhabited by inventors, magicians, and Scotland Yard detectives, all presided over by the amiable and fun-loving Edward VII as the world slid inevitably toward the first great war of the twentieth century.

Erik Larson (Goodreads Author),"The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz",,,,"On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Adolf Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally--and willing to fight to the end.In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows how Churchill taught the British people ""the art of being fearless."" It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports--some released only recently--Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela's illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill's ""Secret Circle,"" to whom he turns in the hardest moments.",,,,February 25th 2020,[],Kindle Edition,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Politics', 'British Literature', 'Biography Memoir']",,B07TRVW6VX,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1567638164l/51187948._SX318_SY475_.jpg,4.23,[],46.0,1.0,,51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile,,,,,95.0,42480.0,464,,Crown,"['19726', '15837', '4884', '1205', '828']",,,"['Buckinghamshire, England (United Kingdom)', 'Oxfordshire, England', 'London, England']",,

Erika Johansen (Goodreads Author),The Queen of the Tearling,,English,,"Magic, adventure, mystery, and romance combine in this epic debut in which a young princess must reclaim her dead mother’s throne, learn to be a ruler—and defeat the Red Queen, a powerful and malevolent sorceress determined to destroy her.On her nineteenth birthday, Princess Kelsea Raleigh Glynn, raised in exile, sets out on a perilous journey back to the castle of her birth to ascend her rightful throne. Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen’s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon—from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic—to prevent her from wearing the crown.Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing. But what she discovers in the capital will change everything, confronting her with horrors she never imagined. An act of singular daring will throw Kelsea’s kingdom into tumult, unleashing the vengeance of the tyrannical ruler of neighboring Mortmesne: the Red Queen, a sorceress possessed of the darkest magic. Now Kelsea will begin to discover whom among the servants, aristocracy, and her own guard she can trust.But the quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun—a wondrous journey of self-discovery and a trial by fire that will make her a legend . . . if she can survive.This book will be a beautifully designed package with illustrated endpapers, a map of the Tearling, and a ribbon marker.",The Queen of the Tearling #1,,07/08/14,April 14th 2015,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Magic', 'Adult', 'Young Adult Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'New Adult']",,9780062290380,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461864815l/22864842.jpg,4.0,['Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Fantasy & for Debut Goodreads Author (2014)'],1022.0,12.0,,22864842-the-queen-of-the-tearling,,,,,92.0,83176.0,464,,Harper Paperbacks,"['28849', '33617', '14398', '4075', '2237']",,,[],,

"Erin Gruwell, Zlata Filipović, The Freedom Writers",The Freedom Writers Diary,,English,,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER & NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTUREStraight from the front line of urban America, the inspiring story of one fiercely determined teacher and her remarkable students.As an idealistic twenty-three-year-old English teacher at Wilson High School in Long beach, California, Erin Gruwell confronted a room of “unteachable, at-risk” students. One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Holocaust—only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and Zlata’s Diary: A Child’s Life in Sarajevo as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels in these books to their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the “Freedom Writers” in homage to the civil rights activists “The Freedom Riders.”With funds raised by a “Read-a-thon for Tolerance,” they arranged for Miep Gies, the courageous Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California, where she declared that Erin Gruwell’s students were “the real heroes.” Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition—appearances on “Prime Time Live” and “All Things Considered,” coverage in People magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley—and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers have graduated from high school and are now attending college.With powerful entries from the students’ own diaries and a narrative text by Erin Gruwell, The Freedom Writers Diary is an uplifting, unforgettable example of how hard work, courage, and the spirit of determination changed the lives of a teacher and her students. The authors’ proceeds from this book will be donated to The Tolerance Education Foundation, an organization set up to pay for the Freedom Writers’ college tuition.

Now she's back with a delicious story where nothing's on the level, everybody's got something to hide, and the only thing honest is the slow, hard pull of irresistible attraction...
  Love. Sex. Destiny. And A Six-Foot-Four Psychic In A Bridesmaid’s Dress? Honey, You Don’t Know Jack...
Jamie Peters no longer believes in true love. True idiots, true scumbags, true moochers - these she believes in wholeheartedly, and she’s got the checkered dating history to prove it. So she’s more than a little skeptical when her cross-dressing psychic tells her she’s about to meet her soul mate - during an accident. Yeah, sounds about right. And then it happens. A knight in shining armor steps between her and a mugger on a subway platform. Just a regular, honest, upright Jack. The kind they don’t make anymore...Jonathon Davidson doesn't believe in destiny - or lying to beautiful women as a rule. But now that Jamie thinks he’s just an ordinary guy, how can he possibly tell her that he’s really, (A) her roommate’s brother, (B) a millionaire to boot, and (C) the jerk who’s investigating her application to his grandfather’s charitable trust because she may be involved in something illegal? Yeah, rhetorical question. He can’t. Not until he knows what’s going on. Besides, it would require being able to resist Jamie’s luscious curves long enough to say, “Hi, my name is Big Liar. Let’s get naked.” Sometimes, destiny sucks...
  Somewhere between truth and flat-out-let’s-talk-about-this-waaay-later fiction, between fate and delicious accidental insanity, lies a whole lot of mind-blowing sex, delirious passion, unfortunate sundresses, fighting, deception, big mistakes and small hopes, and two people are about to discover that everything happens for a reason...

Erin Morgenstern (Goodreads Author),The Starless Sea,,English,,"Far beneath the surface of the earth, upon the shores of the Starless Sea, there is a labyrinthine collection of tunnels and rooms filled with stories. The entryways that lead to this sanctuary are often hidden, sometimes on forest floors, sometimes in private homes, sometimes in plain sight. But those who seek will find. Their doors have been waiting for them.Zachary Ezra Rawlins is searching for his door, though he does not know it. He follows a silent siren song, an inexplicable knowledge that he is meant for another place. When he discovers a mysterious book in the stacks of his campus library he begins to read, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, lost cities, and nameless acolytes. Suddenly a turn of the page brings Zachary to a story from his own childhood impossibly written in this book that is older than he is.A bee, a key, and a sword emblazoned on the book lead Zachary to two people who will change the course of his life: Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired painter, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances. These strangers guide Zachary through masquerade party dances and whispered back room stories to the headquarters of a secret society where doorknobs hang from ribbons, and finally through a door conjured from paint to the place he has always yearned for.

Erin Siegal (Goodreads Author),Finding Fernanda,,English,,"What began as Erin Siegal's 2009 Master's project as a Fellow at the Stabile Center for Investigative Reporting at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism evolved into a complex investigation of $30,000 U.S. dollars, four Guatemalan ""orphans,"" one nonprofit evangelical Christian adoption agency, a family-run child-trafficking ring, one infant cut from her unconscious mother's womb, two tiny missing sisters, and a nine-member Tennessee family who believed wholeheartedly in Christian love and faith-until the dark side of international adoption shattered their trust. Siegal reveals the heart wrenching story of how one poor Guatemalan woman, Mildred Alvarado, ultimately reunited with her kidnapped daughters against all odds-and how the American housewife slated to adopt one of those children, Elizabeth Emanuel, accidentally became a reformer dedicated to an ethical adoption system.FINDING FERNANDA sheds light on the highly politicized landscape of Guatemala's adoption industry, a multi-million dollar trade that was both highly profitable and barely regulated. Children have been stolen, sold, and placed as orphans in corrupt international adoptions to well-intentioned Western parents ever since the industry began in the 1980s, yet the governments of Guatemala and the United States repeatedly proved unwilling and incapable of regulating the baby trade. Of the 100,000 children adopted into the United States between 2004 and 2008, over 20,000 were Guatemalan.With help of documents obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, leaked emails, and key sources inside both the Guatemalan and U.S. governments, Siegal's research traces one compelling case of corruption in detail from start to finish. Along the way, the mechanisms surrounding ""orphan laundering"" are illuminated, including the roles of baby-finders, caretakers, judges, government officials, and more. This cadena perpetua, or perpetual chain, involves everyone from Guatemalan judges to U.S. embassy officials. Provocative as it is captivating, FINDING FERNANDA an overdue, unprecedented look at how adoption corruption occurs-- and a poignant, riveting human story about the power of hope, faith, and determination.",,,10/18/11,November 1st 2011,[],Paperback,"['Adoption', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography Memoir', 'Feminism']",,9780983884507,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314205961l/12295571.jpg,4.24,[],98.0,1.0,,12295571-finding-fernanda,,,,,97.0,214.0,322,,Cathexis Press,"['93', '87', '28', '4', '2']",,,[],,

Ernest Callenbach,Ecotopia,,English,,"A novel both timely and prophetic, Ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia is a hopeful antidote to the environmental concerns of today, set in an ecologically sound future society. Hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the “newest name after Wells, Verne, Huxley, and Orwell,” Callenbach offers a visionary blueprint for the survival of our planet . . . and our future.
  
  
Ecotopia was founded when northern California, Oregon, and Washington seceded from the Union to create a “stable-state” ecosystem: the perfect balance between human beings and the environment. Now, twenty years later, this isolated, mysterious nation is welcoming its first officially sanctioned American visitor: New York Times-Post reporter Will Weston.Skeptical yet curious about this green new world, Weston is determined to report his findings objectively. But from the start, he’s alternately impressed and unsettled by the laws governing Ecotopia’s earth-friendly agenda: energy-efficient “mini-cities” to eliminate urban sprawl, zero-tolerance pollution control, tree worship, ritual war games, and a woman-dominated government that has instituted such peaceful revolutions as the twenty-hour workweek and employee ownership of farms and businesses. His old beliefs challenged, his cynicism replaced by hope, Weston meets a sexually forthright Ecotopian woman and undertakes a relationship whose intensity will lead him to a critical choice between two worlds.

Ernest Cline (Goodreads Author),Armada,,English,,"Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure. But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe. And then he sees the flying saucer. Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called Armada—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders.  No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it. It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can’t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little…familiar? At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could, Armada is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make Ready Player One a phenomenon.",,,,July 14th 2015,"['Zackary Lightman', 'Alexis Larkin', 'Xavier Ulysses Lightman', 'Pamela Lightman']",Hardcover,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Aliens', 'Adult', 'Space']",,9780804137256,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377284428l/16278318.jpg,3.53,"['Golden Duck Award for Young Adult (Hal Clement Award) (2016)', 'Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Science Fiction (2015)']",437.0,5.0,,16278318-armada,,,,,84.0,99499.0,355,,Crown Publishing,"['19114', '33994', '30823', '11787', '3781']",,,[],,

I hope you will find some that you like- In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see, you dull and blunt the instrument you write with. But I would rather have it bent and dulled and know I had to put it on the grindstone and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it, and know that I had something to write about, than to have it bright and shining, and nothing to say, or smooth and well-oiled in the closet, but unused.'

His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who swarm the region, and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair. In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. In turn funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact, To Have and Have Not takes literary high adventure to a new level.

In these fourteen stories, Hemingway begins to examine the themes that would occupy his later works: the casualties of war, the often uneasy relationship between men and women, sport and sportsmanship. In ""Banal Story,"" Hemingway offers a lasting tribute to the famed matador Maera. ""In Another Country"" tells of an Italian major recovering from war wounds as he mourns the untimely death of his wife. ""The Killers"" is the hard-edged story about two Chicago gunmen and their potential victim. Nick Adams makes an appearance in ""Ten Indians,"" in which he is presumably betrayed by his Indian girlfriend, Prudence.

A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War.

The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters — including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations — engages in incomparably rich dialogue.

Ernest Hemingway,For Whom the Bell Tolls,,English,,"In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance.

The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving and wise.

Ernest Hemingway,Death in the Afternoon,,English,,"Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, ""Death in the Afternoon"" is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination.

Ernest J. Gaines,A Lesson Before Dying,,English,,"A Lesson Before Dying is set in a small Cajun community in the late 1940s. Jefferson, a young black man, is an unwitting party to a liquor store shoot out in which three men are killed; the only survivor, he is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Grant Wiggins, who left his hometown for the university, has returned to the plantation school to teach. As he struggles with his decision whether to stay or escape to another state, his aunt and Jefferson's godmother persuade him to visit Jefferson in his cell and impart his learning and his pride to Jefferson before his death. In the end, the two men forge a bond as they both come to understand the simple heroism of resisting and defying the expected. Ernest J.

"Ernesto Sabato, Nino Pipia (Translator)",El túnel,,Spanish,,"Breve e intensa novela publicada en 1948, este logrado fruto de la denominada ""literatura existencial"" le dio a su autor un reconocimiento que traspasó las fronteras nacionales. Para quien todavía no la leyó, El túnel es la mejor introducción al universo prodigioso de Ernesto Sábato; para quien la conoce, un clásico de las letras del continente, una historia sobre el drama del hombre arrojado en el sinsentido más doloroso: la conciencia de la nada. El narrador describe una historia de amor y muerte en la que muestra la soledad del individuo contemporáneo. No están ausentes de esta trama policial y de suspenso, la locura y la increíble reflexión del protagonista, el pintor Juan Pablo Castel, debatiéndose por comprender las causas que lo arrastraron a matar a la mujer que amaba, María Iribarne, y que era su única vía de salvación. En este alucinante drama de la vida interior, seres intrincados en la bestial búsqueda de comprensión ceden a la mentira, la hipocresía y los celos desmedidos hasta el crimen más inexplicable. Aventura amorosa, aventura onírica, aventura del ser que dan testimonio de un asesinato, de cierta memoria culpable y de una valiente introspección.

Over a morning, you can do the laundry or visit the doctor for a check-up; you can run errands...Over a morning, you can stop a school in its track, or lockdown an AP English class. Over a morning, you can get revenge.Green Hill is a small, ordinary Pennsylvania town where nothing ever happens until the morning its normalcy is crushed by a shocking act of violence. One morning the school is interrupted by the frantic announcement calling for a lockdown. AP English teacher, Mike Zarlapski, swings into action, following the lockdown procedures. Although his students help pile as many desks in front of the classroom door as possible, their panic is not allayed as they communicate with what is now the outside world first-in responders, police entering the building, and the shooters who remain at large via cellphone.Internal Lockdown, Ernie Quatrani's, first novel is raw, honest, and his most important novel, although it's his first. The book is told in a straightforward style from different viewpoints, but mostly through the lens of the kids locked in the classroom. Before there was Columbine, a student Mr. Quatrani taught murdered a classmate in a biology lab. The student walked out of the high school after deciding against shooting up the cafeteria. Mr. Quatrani was in the cafeteria proctoring a study hall. As a high school teacher, he functioned in a world where lockdown drills became routine, but there was much more to a lockdown than can be imagined, as Internal Lockdown reveals.

Ernst Jünger,Diario de guerra (1914-1918),,Spanish,,"Movido por su sed de peligros y aventuras, el jovencísimo Ernst Jünger —tenía entonces diecinueve años— se alistó voluntariamente en el 73.º Regimiento de Fusileros, cruzó la frontera de Luxemburgo a finales de 1914 y, poco después, entró en combate. Desde entonces, y casi a diario, relató en quince cuadernos su participación en una contienda que diezmó a una generación entera. Pronto encuentra el infierno: poblaciones arrasadas, heridos abandonados a su suerte, compañeros desventrados; una verdadera máquina de devastación. También describe la dureza de la vida en las trincheras, el peligro de las incursiones nocturnas para capturar prisioneros o las ocasiones en que escapa de la muerte, agazapado en el cráter de un obús.Acompañados por los numerosos dibujos realizados por el propio autor, y por mapas y esquemas de las zonas de combate mencionadas, estos diarios describen la atroz realidad con crudeza y autenticidad, a veces con la fría curiosidad de un entomólogo, al tiempo que nos descubren a un Jünger muchas veces harto de la guerra y de la incompetencia de sus superiores, pero también orgulloso de las heridas que recibió y de las condecoraciones obtenidas, como la prestigiosa Pour le Mérite.Anotado y comentado por Helmuth Kiesel, profesor de literatura alemana y experto en la obra de Jünger, Diario de Guerra (1914-1918) permaneció inédito hasta 2010, y su publicación en Alemania constituyó un auténtico acontecimiento editorial.",,,01/01/90,May 2013,[],Hardcover,[],,9788483834,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410943870l/23237424.jpg,4.16,[],98.0,1.0,,23237424-diario-de-guerra,,,,,96.0,25.0,672,,Tusquets Editores,"['12', '6', '6', '1', '0']",,,[],,
"Ernst Jünger, Joachim Neugroschel (Translator)",Eumeswil,,English,,"Originally published in Germany in 1977, when Junger was eighty-two years old, Eumeswil is the great novel of Junger's creative maturity, a masterpiece by a central figure in modern German literature. Eumeswil is a utopian state ruled by the Condor, a general who has installed himself as a dictator and who dominates the capital from a guarded citadel atop a hill - the Casbah. A refined manipulator of power, the Condor despises the democrats who conspire against him. Venator, the narrator of the novel, is a historian whose discreet and efficient services as the Condor's night steward earn him full access to the forbidden zone, at the very heart of power. Every evening, while attending to the Condor and his guests at the Casbah's night bar, Venator keeps a secret journal in which he records the conversations he overhears, delineating the diverse personalities in the Condor's entourage while sketching out an analysis of the different aspects of the psychology of power. Venator's days are spent building a hidden refuge in the mountains, a hermetic retreat where he hopes one day to realize his dreams of utter self-sufficiency. In the meantime, however, he continues to pursue his career as a historian, using the magnificent tool that has been placed at his disposal - the ""luminar"", a holographic instrument that can summon up any figure or event in human history. Venator, in a word, embodies Junger's ideal of the ""anarch"" - a heroic figure whose radical skepticism and individualism are not to be confused with mere anarchism. Around the opposite figures of the dictator and the anarch, Junger weaves a hallucinatory and poetic rumination on the nature of history and on the mainsprings of political power. At once tale, essay and philosophical poem, Eumeswil offers a desolate and lucid assessment of totalitarianism by an author who witnessed its horrors firsthand.",,,10/30/77,May 1st 1994,[],Hardcover,"['Philosophy', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'German Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'Germany']",,9780941419970,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175327825l/506145.jpg,4.31,[],100.0,1.0,,506145.Eumeswil,,,,,96.0,277.0,384,,Marsilio Publishers,"['145', '90', '31', '6', '5']",,,[],,

Erskine Caldwell,Poor Fool,,English,,"Published in 1930, Poor Fool was Erskine Caldwell's second novel. Like most of his fiction, it revolves around a gallery of grotesque characters motivated by the basest urges. The novel's central figure is Blondy Niles, a down-and-out boxer who exists at the very fringes of society. The garish nighttime world of bars and prostitutes, con men and petty crimes is the milieu in which he moves. When he is approached by Salty Banks to be an unwitting fall guy in a rigged boxing scheme, a calamitous chain of events is set in motion, and death is the inevitable result. Blondy is befriended by a good-hearted prostitute, Louise, but then comes under the powerful, mysterious spell of the gruesome Mrs. Boxx, an enormous, soulless woman who lures him to her house, which has been converted into the most primitive of abortion mills. Despite the terrible acts Mrs. Boxx oversees and that Blondy is compelled to participate in, he inexplicably finds himself unable - or unwilling - to leave this chamber of horror. Only with the help of Dorothy, Mrs. Boxx's younger, daughter, does he finally free himself from the clutches of this demonic, madwoman. Yet freedom proves elusive, for by the end of this surreal, phantasmagoric adventure, Blondy and everyone he cares for have come to a bloody end. Caldwell himself likened Poor Fool to a ""diabolical dream."" Written early in his career, it foreshadows many of the themes that were to characterize his later novels.",,,1930,October 1st 1994,[],Paperback,['Fiction'],,9780807119471,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349025010l/970761.jpg,3.74,[],23.0,1.0,,970761.Poor_Fool,,,,,85.0,46.0,131,,Louisiana State University Press,"['14', '15', '10', '5', '2']",,,[],,

Ervand Abrahamian,"The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations",,English,,"In August 1953, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency orchestrated the swift overthrow of Iran’s democratically elected leader and installed Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in his place. Over the next twenty-six years, the United States backed the unpopular, authoritarian shah and his secret police; in exchange, it reaped a share of Iran’s oil wealth and became a key player in this volatile region.The blowback was almost inevitable, as this new and revealing history of the coup and its consequences shows. When the 1979 Iranian Revolution deposed the shah and replaced his puppet government with a radical Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the shift reverberated throughout the Middle East and the world, casting a long, dark shadow over U.S.-Iran relations that extends to the present day.In this authoritative new history of the coup and its aftermath, noted Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian uncovers little-known documents that challenge conventional interpretations and also sheds new light on how the American role in the coup influenced U.S.-Iranian relations, both past and present. Drawing from the hitherto closed archives of British Petroleum, the Foreign Office, and the U.S. State Department, as well as from Iranian memoirs and published interviews, Abrahamian’s riveting account of this key historical event will change America’s understanding of a crucial turning point in modern U.S.-Iranian relations.",,,01/01/13,February 5th 2013,[],Hardcover,"['History', 'Iran', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Espionage', 'International Relations', 'Sociology', 'Military Fiction']",,9781595588265,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356353564l/13586980.jpg,4.14,[],95.0,1.0,,13586980-the-coup,,,,,96.0,343.0,277,,The New Press,"['132', '145', '52', '9', '5']",,,[],,

"Essie Mae Washington-Williams, William Stadiem",Dear Senator: A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond,,English,,"Breaking nearly eight decades of silence, Essie Mae Washington–Williams comes forward with a story of unique historical magnitude and incredible human drama. Her father, the late Strom Thurmond, was once the nation's leading voice for racial segregation (one of his signature political achievements was his 24–hour filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, done in the name of saving the South from ""mongrelization""). Her mother, however, was a black teenager named Carrie Butler who worked as a maid on the Thurmond family's South Carolina plantation.Set against the explosively changing times of the civil rights movement, this poignant memoir recalls how she struggled with the discrepancy between the father she knew–one who was financially generous, supportive of her education, even affectionate–and the Old Southern politician, railing against greater racial equality, who refused to acknowledge her publicly. From her richly told narrative, as well as the letters she and Thurmond wrote to each other over the years, emerges a nuanced, fascinating portrait of a father who counseled his daughter about her dreams and goals, and supported her in reaching them–but who was unwilling to break with the values of his Dixiecrat constituents.With elegance, dignity, and candor, Washington–Williams gives us a chapter of American history as it has never been written before–told in a voice that will be heard and cherished by future generations.",,,01/25/05,January 24th 2006,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'African American', 'Politics', 'Southern', 'Biography Memoir', 'Social Issues', 'Historical']",,9780060761424,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440386029l/709715._SY475_.jpg,3.9,[],75.0,1.0,,709715.Dear_Senator,,,,,93.0,746.0,240,,Harper Perennial,"['227', '281', '189', '38', '11']",,,[],,

In the small town of Windsor, Colorado, she is known for her easygoing, strong personality, some would even say she isn't afraid of anything. But MacKenzie knows that's not true. She's afraid of losing those closest to her. Recovering from a family tragedy, Kenzie is fully aware of just how big an impact death can have on those it leaves behind. Seeing its effects on other people is something she just can't quite handle. From now on, Kenzie is her own priority.There are not many things that Jaden Hunter can make sense of. He doesn't understand why it was his parents who lost their lives last year. He doesn't understand why his friends don't crack jokes around him any more. He doesn't understand why his teachers still insist on letting him skip assignments.

Escaping gray London in 1972, a beautiful, determined mother takes her daughters, aged 5 and 7, to Morocco in search of adventure, a better life, and maybe love.

The vagaries of the Fairchilds are keenly observed, and sometimes harshly judged, by nine-year-old Laura McRaven, a Fairchild cousin who takes The Yellow Dog train to the Delta for Dabney Fairchild's wedding. An only child whose mother has just died, Laura is resentful of her boisterous, careless cousins, and desperate for their acceptance. As the hour moves closer and closer to wedding day, Laura arrives at a more subtle understanding of both the Fairchilds and herself. Born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi, Eudora Welty is one of the South's finest novelists. She won a Pulitzer in 1972 for The Optimist's Daughter.

Eudora Welty,One Writer's Beginnings,,English,,"Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.",,,10/30/83,July 21st 1998,[],Paperback,"['Memoir', 'Writing', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Essays', 'Southern']",,9780674639270,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348994705l/12590.jpg,4.06,"['National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee for Biography/Autobiography (1984)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (1984)']",180.0,2.0,,12590.One_Writer_s_Beginnings,,,,,95.0,3161.0,104,,Harvard University Press,"['1164', '1235', '598', '127', '37']",,,[],,

As the probe tracks his frantic race toward proving his innocence, he is tormented by mad visions and by the knowledge that his time in the embassy is running out, determined to fight back for his vindication. Responding to little more than the primitive quest for justice at any cost, he retreats ever deeper into the cradle of his own government, one which never has eyes glowed bright green in the headlight, and bares no fangs to bite for his case.

"Eugene B. Sledge, Paul Fussell (Contributor)",With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,,English,,"In his own book, Wartime, Paul Fussell called With the Old Breed ""one of the finest memoirs to emerge from any war."" John Keegan referred to it in The Second World War as ""one of the most arresting documents in war literature."" And Studs Terkel was so fascinated with the story he interviewed its author for his book, ""The Good War."" What has made E.B. Sledge's memoir of his experience fighting in the South Pacific during World War II so devastatingly powerful is its sheer honest simplicity and compassion.Now including a new introduction by Paul Fussell, With the Old Breed presents a stirring, personal account of the vitality and bravery of the Marines in the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa. Born in Mobile, Alabama in 1923 and raised on riding, hunting, fishing, and a respect for history and legendary heroes such as George Washington and Daniel Boone, Eugene Bondurant Sledge (later called ""Sledgehammer"" by his Marine Corps buddies) joined the Marines the year after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and from 1943 to 1946 endured the events recorded in this book. In those years, he passed, often painfully, from innocence to experience.Sledge enlisted out of patriotism, idealism, and youthful courage, but once he landed on the beach at Peleliu, it was purely a struggle for survival. Based on the notes he kept on slips of paper tucked secretly away in his New Testament, he simply and directly recalls those long months, mincing no words and sparing no pain. The reality of battle meant unbearable heat, deafening gunfire, unimaginable brutality and cruelty, the stench of death, and, above all, constant fear. Sledge still has nightmares about ""the bloody, muddy month of May on Okinawa."" But, as he also tellingly reveals, the bonds of friendship formed then will never be severed.Sledge's honesty and compassion for the other marines, even complete strangers, sets him apart as a memoirist of war. Read as sobering history or as high adventure, With the Old Breed is a moving chronicle of action and courage.",,,11/28/81,October 25th 1990,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'World War II', 'Military History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'American History']",,9780195067149,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297640051l/771332.jpg,4.44,[],633.0,7.0,,771332.With_the_Old_Breed,,,,,97.0,28805.0,326,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['17109', '8419', '2533', '473', '271']",,,[],,

His regiment was the first Marine unit to return to the ancient city of Peiping (now Beijing) where they witnessed the last of old China and the rise of the Communist state. Sledge also recounts the difficulty of returning to his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, and resuming civilian life while haunted by shadows of close combat. Through the discipline of writing and the study of biology, he shows how he came to terms with the terrifying memories that had plagued him for years.Poignant and compelling, China Marine provides a frank depiction of the real costs of war, emotional and psychological as well as physical, and reveals the enduring bond that develops between men who face the horrors of war.",,,05/30/02,July 1st 2003,[],Paperback,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military History', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'China', 'Autobiography']",,9780195167764,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428794437l/421398.jpg,4.22,[],99.0,1.0,,421398.China_Marine,,,,,97.0,854.0,167,,"Oxford University Press, USA","['396', '281', '154', '17', '6']",,,[],,

In The Parrot's Lament, noted environmentalist Eugene Linden offers more than one hundred true anecdotes about animal acts of cooperation, heroism, escape--even tales of deception or manipulation of human beings. Drawing on the first-person experiences of veterinarians, field biologists, researchers, and trainers, Linden has compiled a warmly entertaining and powerfully persuasive argument for animal consciousness that, while not human, far exceeds what humans usually grant animals. Scientifically sound and emotionally compelling, The Parrot's Lament contains remarkable stories that are sure to resonate with animal lovers, turning skeptics everywhere into believers.",,,10/30/99,August 1st 2000,[],Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Science', 'Nature', 'Biology', 'Anthologies']",,9780452280687,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436398707l/10476._SY475_.jpg,3.93,[],99.0,1.0,,10476.The_Parrot_s_Lament_and_Other_True_Tales_of_Animal_Intrigue_Intelligence_and_Ingenuity,,,,,94.0,428.0,224,,Plume,"['133', '159', '110', '24', '2']",,,[],,

Eugene Rogan,"The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, 1914-1920",,English,,"In 1914 the Ottoman Empire was depleted of men and resources after years of war against Balkan nationalist and Italian forces. But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The Great War spelled the end of the Ottomans, unleashing powerful forces that would forever change the face of the Middle East.In The Fall of the Ottomans, award-winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region’s crucial role in the conflict. Bolstered by German money, arms, and military advisors, the Ottomans took on the Russian, British, and French forces, and tried to provoke Jihad against the Allies in their Muslim colonies. Unlike the static killing fields of the Western Front, the war in the Middle East was fast-moving and unpredictable, with the Turks inflicting decisive defeats on the Entente in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Gaza before the tide of battle turned in the Allies’ favor. The great cities of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and, finally, Damascus fell to invading armies before the Ottomans agreed to an armistice in 1918.The postwar settlement led to the partition of Ottoman lands between the victorious powers, and laid the groundwork for the ongoing conflicts that continue to plague the modern Arab world. A sweeping narrative of battles and political intrigue from Gallipoli to Arabia, The Fall of the Ottomans is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the Great War and the making of the modern Middle East.",,,,March 10th 2015,[],Kindle Edition,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War I', 'Politics', 'Military History', 'World History', 'Military Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Islam']",,9780465023073,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426972194l/24481072.jpg,4.14,['MHM Book of the Year Nominee (2016)'],99.0,1.0,,24481072-the-fall-of-the-ottomans,,,,,97.0,2855.0,512,,Basic Books,"['1021', '1298', '460', '57', '19']",,,[],,

Its success had gone far beyond Italy, as the book has been translated into Spanish, French, Japanese and three other languages. This epic historical novel about World War II and after, written from the author's own personal experiences as an Italian Freedom Fighter, is a profoundly moving account of the war, those who fought in it on both sides, and the effects the war had on families in the author's hometown in Italy. On a wider scale, it is a faithful witness to the actual events of the war - including the role of historical personages who appear, the Russian campaign, the Nazi barbarism, the Communist gulag, the North Italian resistance, and political life in the two decades following the war. This world, filled with powerful personalities, drama and clashing armies, bathes in the light of the truth. What makes this truly historical novel, with its epic scope, a masterpiece is the underlying spiritual dimensions of the protagonist, his family and friends, which illuminates the ongoing tragedy of the war and its aftermath. In the end, it is a story of faith and hope in a world reduced to barbarism and cruelty. Born in 1921 in Lombardy, Eugenio Corti joined the Italian Freedom Fighters.

Eugène Ionesco,Rhinocéros,,French,,"""Tous les chats sont mortels. Socrate est mortel. Donc Socrate est un chat."" Tout langage stéréotypé devient aberrant. C'est ce que Ionesco démontre dans Rhinocéros, pièce qui a tout d'abord vu le jour sous la forme d'une nouvelle. Partisan d'un théâtre total, il porte l'absurde à son paroxysme en l'incarnant matériellement. Allégorie des idéologies de masse, le rhinocéros, cruel et dévastateur, ne se déplace qu'en groupe et gagne du terrain à une vitesse vertigineuse. Seul et sans trop savoir pourquoi, Bérenger résiste à la mutation. Il résiste pour notre plus grande délectation, car sa lutte désespérée donne lieu à des caricatures savoureuses, à des variations de tons et de genres audacieuses et anticonformistes. La sclérose intellectuelle, l'incommunicabilité et la perversion du langage engendrent des situations tellement tragiques qu'elles en deviennent comiques, tellement grotesques qu'elles ne peuvent être que dramatiques. On a dit du théâtre de Ionesco qu'il était engagé ; il l'est, en faveur de l'individu, menacé de marginalisation quand, malgré ses faiblesses, il parvient à résister aux tentations avilissantes qu'il a lui-même fait naître.`",,,10/30/59,August 3rd 1992,[],Paperback,"['Plays', 'Theatre', 'France', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'French Literature', 'School', 'Literature', '20th Century']",,9999999999999,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366248012l/27736.jpg,3.88,[],99.0,1.0,,27736.Rhinoc_ros,,,,,92.0,10802.0,246,,Editions Gallimard,"['3224', '4145', '2556', '659', '218']",,,[],,

Euripides,Αλκηστισ,"African Americans, Jews, and American Popular Song",,Alcestis (Greek mythology),"Euripides of Athens (ca. 485-406 BC), famous in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations wrote nearly ninety plays. Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes. Alcestis is the story of a woman who agrees--in order to save her husband's life--to die in his place. Medea is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with Cyclops, a satyr play--the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction. In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides---parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art--cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves.

In Orestes, the most popular of the tragedian's plays in the ancient world, Euripides explores theemotional consequences of Orestes' murder of his mother on the individuals concerned, and makes the tale resonate with advice to Athens about the threat to democracy posed by political pressure groups. The Suppliant Women is a commentary on the politics of empire, as the Athenian king Theseusdecides to use force of arms rather than persuasion against Thebes.

For not only can it head a negative sentence, announcing its judgement, or answer a question, implying its negated content, it can, and mostly does, in the beginning of speech, express an assertion of the resistant will-sometimes just that and nothing more. The adult antiphony to the toddler's incessant no is another no, that of preventive command, and the great commandments of later life continue to be prohibitions: Nine of the Ten Commandments are in the negative. Eva Brann explores nothingness in the third book of her trilogy, which has treated imagination, time and now naysaying.

Eva Koleva Timothy,Lost in Learning: The Art of Discovery,,English,,"  Lost in Learning: The Art of Discovery  offers a visually compelling narrative on historical genius and the potential for the same within each of us  Learning may well be the most astounding power on earth.  It shapes entire civilizations and transforms the world, one individual at a time.  Yet, all too often we allow learning to become just a long succession of the three T s: texts, tests and tedium.  Have we lost touch with the wonders of human curiosity, ingenuity and creativity which will ultimately determine the success of our schools, our businesses and society?  For those looking to re-connect learning with their life s aspirations, Eva Koleva Timothy s, Lost in Learning is an invitation to embark on the journey of a lifetime.  These stunning historical photographs breath new life into The Age of Discovery even as the artist s lens provides an illuminating window into human potential.  Genius becomes less a matter of genetics and more about purpose and perspective.

Eva Moraal,Overstroomd,,Dutch,,"We bevinden ons in de tijd na de Grote Overstromingen. Het land is verdeeld in veilige, droge gebieden, en terreinen die gevaar lopen als het water weer stijgt. Ook de bevolking leeft strikt gescheiden: de Drogen vormen de rijke elite, de Natten het werkvolk dat een hard bestaan leidt om te overleven – en van waaruit steeds sterker verzet optreedt.Nina is een Droge, de dochter van de Gouverneur. Tijdens de laatste overstroming is haar school getroffen en haar zusje verdronken. Daardoor is ze gedwongen om, zij het onder een andere naam, lessen te volgen op een school in het Natte gebied.Op school wordt ze verplicht om met Max, een Natte, een werkstuk te maken. Wat met wederzijdse achterdocht begint, groeit al snel uit tot een fascinatie voor elkaars wereld en een ontluikende vriendschap. Maar de situatie is complex. Max’ vader is omgekomen bij de laatste overstroming, en er worden vraagtekens gezet bij de rol die de Gouverneur daarbij speelde.

Eva Márquez (Goodreads Author),Sweetest Taboo,,English,,"Isabel Cruz was fifteen years old when she met Tom Stevens. She was 15 when they started dating, and 16 when she lost her virginity to him. By the time she turned 18 and went to college, everything had fallen apart.This hadn’t been an ordinary love, though. Not a love between two dear friends, or even high school sweethearts. This had been the most taboo sort of love there was: a relationship between a student and her teacher. Isabel started her high school career as a normal student, but set her sights on Tom Stevens as soon as she met him, and pursued him with an intense – and sometimes reckless – fascination. When he finally approached her after swim practice and told her that he shared her feelings, it was the start of a forbidden and dangerous relationship.Join Isabel as she makes her way through this dark love story, hiding from teachers, lying to her parents, and defying the authorities to make a life with the man she loves. Watch as she discovers the wonders of love and romance, and the terrible betrayal of jealous friends. And cry with her when she learns the hard truth about life and the people in her world. Sweetest Taboo is inspired by the true and tragic stories of students who fall in love with their teachers, and live with the hard truths of forbidden romances. In a world full of after-school specials on sexual predators, this touching book seeks a different path, casting both student and teacher in a gentle light, and showing that true love may lie at the base of even the most illicit romance.",Sweetest Taboo #1,,09/18/12,October 1st 2012,[],Paperback,"['Romance', 'Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Coming Of Age', 'Drama', 'Teachers', 'New Adult', 'Love Story', 'Fiction']",,B009OKSNYC,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355597104l/15754577.jpg,3.4,[],98.0,1.0,,15754577-sweetest-taboo,,,,,78.0,489.0,295,,Terra-Mía Press,"['106', '135', '139', '65', '44']",,,[],,

But, as summer and compassion wane, the author strips away the pretense of youth and lays bare the blunt, primeval urge to crush, defile, betray.

On the ridge five companies of United States cavalry - 262 soldiers, comprising officers and troopers - fought desperately but hopelessly. When the guns fell silent, no soldier - including their commanding officer, Lt Col. George Armstrong Custer - had survived. Custer's Last Stand is among the most enduring events in American history - 130 years after the fact, books continue to be written and people continue to argue about even the most basic details surrounding the Little Bighorn.

He follows four men throughout: Admiral William (""Bull"") Halsey, the macho, gallant, racist American fleet commander; Admiral Takeo Kurita, the Japanese battleship commander charged with making what was, in essence, a suicidal fleet attack against the American invasion of the Philippines; Admiral Matome Ugaki, a self-styled samurai who was the commander of all kamikazes and himself the last kamikaze of the war; and Commander Ernest Evans, a Cherokee Indian and Annapolis graduate who led his destroyer on the last great charge in the last great naval battle in history.""Sea of Thunder"" climaxes with the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the biggest naval battle ever fought, over four bloody and harrowing days in October 1944. We see Halsey make an epic blunder just as he reaches for true glory; we see the Japanese navy literally sailing in circles, torn between the desire to die heroically and the exhausted, unacceptable realization that death is futile; we sail with Commander Evans and the men of the USS ""Johnston"" into the jaws of the Japanese fleet and exult and suffer with them as they torpedo a cruiser, bluff and confuse the enemy -- and then, their ship sunk, endure fifty horrific hours in shark-infested water.Thomas, a journalist and historian, traveled to Japan, where he interviewed veterans of the Imperial Japanese Navy who survived the Battle of Leyte Gulf and friends and family of the two Japanese admirals. From new documents and interviews, he was able to piece together and answer mysteries about the Battle of LeyteGulf that have puzzled historians for decades.

Evan Wright (Goodreads Author),"Generation Kill: Devil Dogs, Iceman, Captain America, and the New Face of American War",,English,,"
  Another nameless town, another target for First Recon. It's only five in the afternoon, but a sandtorm has plunged everything into a hellish twilight of murky, red dust. On rooftops, in alleyways lurk militiamen with machine guns, AK rifles and the odd rocket-propelled grenade. Artillery bombardment has shattered the town's sewers and rubble is piled up in lagoons of human excrement. It stinks. Welcome to Iraq...
Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam. They were a new breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears-soldiers raised on hip hop, Internet porn, Marilyn Manson, video games and The Real World, a band of born-again Christians, dopers, Buddhists, and New Agers who gleaned their precepts from kung fu movies and Oprah Winfrey. Cocky, brave, headstrong, wary, and mostly unprepared for the physical, emotional, and moral horrors ahead, the ""First Suicide Battalion"" would spearhead the blitzkrieg on Iraq, and fight against the hardest resistance Saddam had to offer. Generation Kill is the funny, frightening, and profane firsthand account of these remarkable men, of the personal toll of victory, and of the randomness, brutality, and camaraderie of a new American war.",,,06/17/04,February 1st 2005,"['Rudy Reyes', 'Evan Wright', 'Brad Colbert', 'Josh Ray Person', 'Nathaniel Fick', 'Antonio Espera', 'Harold James Trombley', 'Robert Timothy Bryan', 'Evan Stafford', 'Walt Hasser', 'Mike Wynn', 'Gabe Garza', 'Jason Lilley', 'Leandro Baptista', 'Anthony Jacks', 'James Chaffin', 'Stephen Ferrando', 'Dave McGraw', 'John Sixta', 'Bryan Patterson', 'Ray Griego', 'Todd Eckloff', 'Eric Kocher', 'Larry Shawn Patrick', 'James Mattis', 'Meesh']",Paperback,"['Nonfiction', 'Military Fiction', 'History', 'War', 'Military History', 'Memoir', 'Journalism', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Contemporary']",,9780425200407,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441919496l/543103._SY475_.jpg,4.27,"['J.

I could never be good.”The Good Body starts with Eve’s tortured relationship with her own “post-forties” stomach and her skirmishes with everything from Ab Rollers to fad diets and fascistic trainers in an attempt get the “flabby badness” out. As Eve hungrily seeks self-acceptance, she is joined by the voices of women from L.A. to Kabul, whose obsessions are also laid bare: A young Latina candidly critiques her humiliating “spread,” a stubborn layer of fat that she calls “a second pair of thighs.” The wife of a plastic surgeon recounts being systematically reconstructed–inch by inch–by her “perfectionist” husband. An aging magazine executive, still haunted by her mother’s long-ago criticism, describes her desperate pursuit of youth as she relentlessly does sit-ups.Along the way, Eve also introduces us to women who have found a hard-won peace with their bodies: an African mother who celebrates each individual body as signs of nature’s diversity; an Indian woman who transcends “treadmill mania” and delights in her plump cheeks and curves; and a veiled Afghani woman who is willing to risk imprisonment for a taste of ice cream. These are just a few of the inspiring stories woven through Eve’s global journey from obsession to enlightenment. Ultimately, these monologues become a personal wake-up call from Eve to love the “good bodies” we inhabit.From the Hardcover edition.",,,01/01/04,November 9th 2004,[],Hardcover,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Plays', 'Womens', 'Drama', 'Gender Studies', 'Essays', 'Memoir', 'Womens Studies', 'Theatre']",,9780375502842,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428178281l/531495.jpg,3.67,[],61.0,1.0,,531495.The_Good_Body,,,,,86.0,2076.0,112,,Villard,"['545', '668', '570', '226', '67']",,,[],,
Eve Ensler,I am an Emotional Creature,,English,,"In this daring, provocative, and insightful book, bestselling author and internationally acclaimed playwright Eve Ensler writes fictional monologues and stories inspired by girls around the globe. Moving through a world of topics and emotions, these voices are fierce, alive, tender, complicated, imaginative, and smart. Girls today often find themselves in a struggle between remaining strong and true to themselves and conforming to society’s expectations in an attempt to please. They are taught not to be too intense, too passionate, too smart, too caring, too open. They are encouraged to shut down their instincts, their outrage, their desires and their dreams, to be polite, to obey the rules. I Am an Emotional Creature is a celebration of the authentic voice inside every girl and an inspiring call to action for girls everywhere to speak up, follow their dreams, and become the women they were always meant to be.Among the girls Ensler creates are an American who struggles with peer pressure in a suburban high school; an anorexic blogging as she eats less and less; a Masai girl from Kenya unwilling to endure female genital mutilation; a Bulgarian sex slave, no more than fifteen, a Chinese factory worker making Barbies; an Iranian student who is tricked into a nose job; a pregnant girl trying to decide if she should keep her baby.Through rants, poetry, questions, and facts, we come to understand the universality of girls everywhere: their resiliency, their wildness, their pain, their fears, their secrets, and their triumphs. I Am an Emotional Creature is a call, a reckoning, an education, an act of empowerment for girls, and an illumination for parents and for us all.",,,10/30/10,February 9th 2010,[],Hardcover,"['Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Poetry', 'Plays', 'Short Stories', 'Womens', 'Womens Studies', 'Gender', 'Psychology', 'Coming Of Age']",,9781400061044,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320543253l/6979094.jpg,4.02,[],100.0,1.0,,6979094-i-am-an-emotional-creature,,,,,93.0,2985.0,176,,Villard,"['1162', '985', '618', '167', '53']",,,[],,

Eve Forward,Villains by Necessity,,English,,"With the banishment of Evil from the realms, the final victory of Good is assured-unless a few stalwart antiheroes can save the world from a serious and potentially fatal imbalance. First novelist Forward explores the complications that arise from a surfeit of ""goodness"" in the world. The result is a skewed version of the epic fantasy that features an assassin, a thief, an evil sorceress, a dark knight, and an implacable druid as the villains-turned-heroes who must restore the delicate balance of opposing forces before their world disappears in a blinding flash of Goodness and Light. -- Library JournalForward's first novel gives the concept of the balance between good and evil a most ingenious twist: What if good were so totally triumphant that it became a worse danger than evil, and a band of unemployed evil characters had to go on a desperate quest to find the means of putting the saving bit of evil back into the world? The result of this twist is an almost straightforward quest tale, with numerous well-drawn characters (including a centaur who starts off as a secret agent for good and eventually joins the side of evil), great ingenuity about magic, very creditable world-building, and considerable wit. Although bearing its share of first-novel flaws, it has many more virtues, which include an underlying, serious examination of the good-evil dichotomy that is the basis of so many role-playing games. -- Roland Green",,,10/29/95,March 1st 1996,[],Paperback,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Humor', 'Adventure', 'High Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Adult', 'Unfinished']",,9780812522280,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335913626l/401454.jpg,4.19,[],198.0,2.0,,401454.Villains_by_Necessity,,,,,93.0,1559.0,544,,Tom Doherty Assoc Llc,"['772', '448', '234', '66', '39']",,,[],,

Miss Margaret has been the Methodist church organist for almost 40 years and she truly loves the pipe organ she plays. In addition to valuing the tangible instrument, there is a deeper, more ethereal component to this situation. Miss Margaret uses the organ as a means of expression, one in which she pours her heart and soul into. After so many years of joined experience, she feels the organ actually contains a piece of her. Playing the old pipe organ has been a consistent source of joy the entire time she’s been the organist. Her beloved church has fallen into disrepair from years of haphazard neglect and a sect in the church advocates reconstruction using state of the art materials and technology. A rift forms between the church members who want to repair the church to its original state and the progressive sect who want to modernize as renovations take place. Decisions reach a crescendo when it is discovered that Miss Margaret’s cherished pipe organ needs complete restoration. It appears that progressive attitudes will prevail over the traditional frame of reference that the people in the town have historically lived by. Miss Margaret becomes painfully aware that times have changed while she seems to have been standing still.

You: a) Wish them luck, and walk away with your head held high (because that’s what society expects you to do)? b) Quietly seethe, but accept that there is just nothing you can do about it (because it easier for everyone if you do nothing)? c) Dig up dirt on the bitch (because someone like this would undoubtedly have dirt), use it to sabotage their relationship, then sit back with a glass of Pinot Grigio and watch them burn? Answer: C. Oh, totally C. ******Meet Scarlett Smyth. She’s drop-dead gorgeous, has a rocking body and has an above average IQ. She brags that she can ensnare any husband or taken male, and …she often does. She also is ambitious and has a penchant for anything expensive. When the shrewd and ambitious temptress lays eyes on Bradley Murdoch, she believes she has found her dream man and a ticket to the high life she’s entitled to. There are just two problems: 1) Bradley is married to Rival. Happily at that. 2) They have children. Adorable little girls. Do those facts deter Scarlett in any way? No, not at all. She is determined to steal Bradley, smoothly replace Rival in his life and show him how to really live life. In a calculating move, the seductress (she is so good at seduction, she is even penning a book on it) befriends the quiet and unassuming Rival and worms her way into Bradley’s life. There’s more: To expedite things, Scarlett the mistress, engineers a way to wipe Rival out of the picture - sends the clueless wife on a “vacation”. But Scarlett may have underestimated her opponent. When Rival realizes the extent of the betrayal, she decides, even though she lacks Scarlett’s genius IQ, not to turn the other cheek. In fact, she is determined to win back her husband, believing that he is a good man who is simply mistaking lust for love. She believes that someone like Scarlett has to have skeletons in her cupboards and she begins to snoop around, anything she can use against the other woman, anything that can help her exact revenge.What Rival doesn’t realize is: no one crosses Scarlett and gets away with it.

"Evelyn M. Monahan, Rosemary Neidel-Greenlee",And If I Perish: Frontline U.S. Army Nurses in World War II,,English,,"In World War II, 59,000 women voluntarily risked their lives for their country as U.S. Army nurses. When the war began, some of them had so little idea of what to expect that they packed party dresses; but the reality of service quickly caught up with them, whether they waded through the water in the historic landings on North African and Normandy beaches, or worked around the clock in hospital tents on the Italian front as bombs fell all around them. For more than half a century these women's experiences remained untold, almost without reference in books, historical societies, or military archives. After years of reasearch and hundreds of hours of interviews, Evelyn M. Monahan and Rosemary Neidel-Greenlee have created a dramatic narrative that at last brings to light the critical role that women played throughout the war. From the North African and Italian Campaigns to the Liberation of France and the Conquest of Germany, U.S. Army nurses rose to the demands of war on the frontlines with grit, humor, and great heroism.

Eyal Sabag,God's Tissues (From 100% Cerebral Palsy to 100% Realization & Fulfillment in Life),,English,,"“Happiness and success are not just goals to reach: they are a way of living...” (Eyal Sabag)Eyal Sabag is one of the most sought-out coaches and motivational speakers in Israel. Here he provides a “hindsight” glimpse into his unbelievable life, revealing his story of transformation: from almost complete disability (caused by cerebral palsy at birth) to a lifetime of fulfillment and self-realization. As Eyal often advises, “if I can do it, so can you!”At the age of 24, after enduring years of self pity, needy reliance on others, insecurity, and a strong belief that his life is just a product of one case of very bad luck, Eyal found another way to live. On this new path, which he calls “From Disable to Able,” Eyal has learned how to use the seemingly magical power of the subconscious, positive thinking, and imagination; all of which opened the door to a brand new world: one in which he retook control over his choices and actions in life. Eyal now leads a life enriched by taking practical and responsible actions. He says he has never felt happier, stronger, or more whole. Through a deep inner perspective, enhanced by a light and humoristic approach to life in the face of hardships, in this book Eyal provides you with a set of practical tools that allow you to go from a “fixation state-of-mind” to spiritual, mental and physical prosperity and freedom.

Imprisoned for some weeks in a wire cage open to the elements, Pound suffered a nervous collapse from the physical and emotional strain. Out of the agony of his own inferno came the eleven cantos that became the sixth book of his modernist epic, The Cantos, themselves conceived as a Divine Comedy for our time. The Pisan Cantos were published in 1948 by New Directions and in the following year were awarded the Bollingen Prize for poetry by the Library of Congress. The honor came amid violent controversy, for the dark cloud of treason still hung over Pound, incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Yet there is no doubt that The Pisan Cantos displays some of his finest and most affecting writing, marking an elegaic turn to the personal while synthesizing the philosophical and economic political themes of his previous cantos.

"Eça de Queirós, Carlos Reis (Introdução)",A Cidade e as Serras,,Portuguese,,"Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #5José Maria de Eça de Queiroz (Póvoa de Varzim, 25 de novembro de 1845 — Neuilly-sur-Seine, 16 de agosto de 1900), escritor e ensaísta, foi um dos nomes mais importantes da literatura portuguesa. De nome completo José Maria de Eça de Queirós nasceu a Novembro de 1845, numa casa na Praça do Almada, em Póvoa de Varzim. O seu pai, José Maria de Almeida de Teixeira de Queirós, nascido no Brasil e vindo para Portugal com um ano de idade, provinha de uma família de magistrados perseguidos pelos seus ideais liberais que defendiam uma doutrina constitucional. Eça foi internado no Colégio da Lapa, no Porto, de onde saiu em 1861, com dezasseis anos, para a Universidade de Coimbra, onde estudou Direito. Num ambiente boémio da cidade universitária de Coimbra estes jovens reuniam-se para trocar ideias, livros e formas para renovar a vida política e cultural portuguesa, que estava a viver uma autêntica revolução social com a introdução dos novos meios de transportes ferroviários que traziam, todos os dias, novidades do centro da Europa, influenciando esta geração para novas ideologias e valores. Foi nesse grupo que Eça conheceu os futuros escritores e poetas, Teófilo Braga, Ramalho Ortigão, Guerra Junqueiro, Guilherme de Azevedo, Oliveira Martins, entre outros; mas sobretudo, foi aí que travou amizade com Antero de Quental, um jovem carismático a quem os membros do grupo chamavam de líder e que incentivou os restantes a seguir e a difundir as então recentes correntes ideológicas e literárias europeias: o Positivismo, o Socialismo e o Realismo-Naturalismo. Notabilizou-se pela originalidade e riqueza do seu estilo e linguagem, nomeadamente pelo realismo descritivo e pela crítica social constantes nos seus romances mas, tal como o crítico literário, Jacinto Prado Coelho disse: ""foi mais analista social do que psicólogo; ironizou Portugal porque muito o amava e o queria melhor.""",,,10/28/01,1992,"['Jacinto', 'José Fernandes', 'Jacinto Galião', 'Cintinho', 'Grilo', 'Joaninha']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Portugal', 'Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'School', 'Adult', '19th Century']",,9789725681268,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1244543352l/1092477.jpg,3.74,[],294.0,4.0,,1092477.A_Cidade_e_as_Serras,,,,,88.0,5515.0,247,,Verbo,"['1454', '2037', '1367', '463', '194']",,,[],,
"Eça de Queirós, Ester de Lemos (Introdução)",Os Maias,,Portuguese,,"Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #15Os Maias é uma das obras mais conhecidas do escritor português Eça de Queiroz. O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acção de Os Maias passa-se em Lisboa, na segunda metade do século XIX, e apresenta-nos a história de três gerações da família Maia. A acção inicia-se no Outono de 1875, quando Afonso da Maia, nobre e pobre proprietário, se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recém formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descrição da casa - ""O Ramalhete,"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassóis, e não em algo fresco ou campestre, tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpático do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou, pois não se lhe conhecem defeitos. É um homem de carácter, culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. Após o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exílio por razões de ordem política. Há em Os Maias um retrato da Lisboa da epóca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequência até ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vá a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. É possível seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio Público, e que é descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o país uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa Olávia...), é tudo uma choldra ignóbil. Predomina uma visão de estrangeirado, de quem só valoriza as civilizações superiores - da França e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os políticos são mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boémios e dissolutos, retrógrados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boémios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto não conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois não há hipódromo à altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas não vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cúmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda há alguma esperanca implícita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e João da Ega dizem que o apetite humano é a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terão apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes está a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa não leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas começam a correr para apanhar o americano (eléctrico). Mais do que crítica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um país - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde A Cidade e as Serras, expõe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raízes rurais ancestrais não atingidas pela degradação da civilização, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'Os Maias.",,,10/28/88,April 2003,"['Carlos da Maia', 'João da Ega', 'Maria Eduarda', 'Afonso da Maia', 'Maria Monforte', 'Eusébiozinho', 'Alencar', 'Conde de Gouvarinho', 'Sousa Neto', 'Palma Cavalão', 'Dâmaso Salcede', 'Steinbroken', 'Cohen', 'Craft', 'Condessa de Gouvarinho', 'Cruges', 'Tancredo', 'Sr. Guimarães', 'Rufino']",Paperback,"['Classics', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Portugal', 'School', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']",,9789725681367,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg,4.02,"['PEN Translation Prize for Margaret Jull Costa (2008)', 'Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize (2008)']",2584.0,30.0,,1249630.Os_Maias,,,,,93.0,17143.0,681,,Verbo,"['6235', '6476', '3205', '925', '302']",,,[],,
"Eça de Queirós, Margaret Jull Costa (Translator)",The Crime of Father Amaro,,English,,"Eça de Queirs's novel is a lurid satire of clerical corruption in a town in Portugal during a period before and after the 1871 Paris Commune.""Young, virile Father Amaro arrives in Leira and is taken in as a lodger by São Joaneira. Her budding, devout, dewy-lipped daughter Amélia is soon lusted after by the young priest. What ensues is a secret love affair amidst a host of compelling minor characters: Canon Dias, a priest, glutton, and Sao Joaneira's lover; Dona Maria da Assuncao, a wealthy widow with a roomful of religious relics, agog at any hint of sex; Joao Eduardo, repressed atheist, free-thinker, and suitor to Amelia. Eca's incisive critique flies like a shattering mirror, jabbing everything from the hypocrisy of a rich and powerful Church, to the provincialism of Portuguese society of the time.Haunting, The Crime of Father Amaro is the ghost of a forgotten religion of tolerance, wisdom, and equality.
