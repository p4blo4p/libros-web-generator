# Allow crawling of the main content pages under each supported language
Allow: /en/
Allow: /es/
Allow: /fr/
Allow: /it/
Allow: /de/

# If you have static assets (CSS, JS, images) in a specific folder like /static/
# and want to ensure crawlers can access them for page rendering, you can add:
# Allow: /static/
# (This is often the default behavior if not disallowed, but can be made explicit)

# Disallow any specific paths you don't want indexed.
# For example, if you had an admin section:
# Disallow: /admin/
# Or internal API endpoints:
# Disallow: /api/internal/
# (Based on your provided routes, there are no obvious paths to disallow yet)

# Specify the location of your sitemap(s)
# Replace 'https://www.yourdomain.com' with your actual domain
Sitemap: https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
# If you have multiple sitemaps, for instance, one per language:
# Sitemap: https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap_en.xml
# Sitemap: https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap_es.xml
# ... and so on for other languages.
